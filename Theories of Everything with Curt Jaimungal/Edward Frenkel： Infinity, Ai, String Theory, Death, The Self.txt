But I think that you actually get it, you know, it's half tongue in cheek the way you call it.
And you don't call it theory of everything, right? You call it theories of everything.
So, which kind of suggests that it's not as simple as one might think.
Edward Frankel is a prominent figure in the mathematical community. In fact,
he was a professor at Harvard at 21, which is unparalleled. He's known for his work on the
Langland's program, which is a blueprint aiming to bridge seemingly unrelated areas of math.
A key aspect of Frankel's contributions lie in his investigations of Hitchin-Moduli spaces and
Kakmudi algebras, but what are they? Hitchin-Moduli spaces generalize certain types of differential
equations, specifically ones related to something called connections on vector bundles over Riemann
surfaces. These are akin to trying to categorize different shapes based on how many corners they
have. Technically, these are called invariants. On the other hand, Kakmudi algebras are infinite
dimensional algebras, which are usually introduced as extensions of other familiar structures in
math. In fact, there's even a question posed by Richard Borchards, a field medallist, who took
the Kakmudi concept and put it on steroids with something called vertex operator algebras, posing
a question to Edward. Also, to be clear, certain representations of those Kakmudi algebras are
realized as vector operator algebras. VOAs aren't an extension of Kakmudi. As usual,

More important than the math, this podcast delves into Edward's personal reflections.
Edward touches on what it means to reconnect with yourself, and he does so while confronting
vast topics like infinity, death, and childhood trauma. My name is Kirchay Mungle, and on this
channel, I use my background in mathematical physics to analyze various theories of everything,
from Wolframs to string theory. We even explore consciousness and AI. As an aside,
though this is an important theme in this conversation, is a theme that I resonate with
from The Lord of the Rings, which is the story where Frodo gets stabbed by a special blade
early on in the book, and then toward the end of the book, while everyone else is happy,
and the problems are resolved, including with Frodo, he succeeded in what he was attempting to do.
The scar never heals. The wound still hurts him years and years later, and the lesson,
or the symbolism, is that there are some things that can happen to you that don't go away. There
are some wounds that while on the surface they heal, they shape you. That's always touched me.
That touches me more than any other aspect of Lord of the Rings, and it's something that comes up
in this conversation. Enjoy this revelatory podcast, this intimate podcast with Professor
of Mathematics at Berkeley, Edward Frankel, one of my favorite podcasts. Welcome, Professor Frankel.
Thank you. I've been very much looking forward to this conversation for weeks and weeks,
so it's an honor. I'm happy. I'm privileged. Thank you for coming on.
It's my pleasure. It's great to be here. Being interviewed by you, Kurt, I have
watched some of the videos on your channel and found them inspiring and fascinating,
so I'm glad to join the family. Even that's an honor that you've watched,
that you've heard of the channel, let alone watched some of them. What are you up to these days,
and what excites you about it? Okay. Well, I'm a mathematician and a Berkeley professor.
I feel like my day job, in other words, something that has been
the constant throughout my life, is my research. Teaching too, but research
is something that I have really devoted, I suppose, most of my energy in my adult life.
So my research is on a subject which is called the Langlands program. It's named after mathematician
Robert Langlands, who is a professor emeritus now at the Institute for Advanced Study.
In Princeton, where I would like to mention that he used to occupy the office
that was formerly Albert Einstein's office at the Institute. So in the late 1960s,
Langlands came up with a bunch of conjectures and ideas which became known as Langlands program.
And what this is, what it was originally, was trying to connect seemingly unrelated questions
in different parts of mathematics, specifically number theory on one side,
and harmonic analysis on the other side. I don't know if I can talk more about this,
if you like, later I can explain more detail. But just to set the stage, so this is something
that excited mathematicians for several generations, more than 50 years, obviously.
And in the 1980s, a new sort of, a new domain in the Langlands program emerged,
which has to do with things that are connected not so much to number theory, but to geometry.
And eventually quantum physics, and it has to do with what's called Riemann surfaces,
such as a sphere or the surface of a donut, and so on, so called Riemann surfaces.
And so my research has been on this subject for many years, but there was something interesting
about it that distinguished it from the original formulation of the Langlands program.
And the Langlands program, it's about functions and operators acting on functions. It's actually,
you know, we can think about it in terms of quantum mechanics. There's a Hilbert space,
and there is some computing operators acting in a Hilbert space. And we want to diagonalize them,
want to find their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. That's the original formulation. But in the
geometric formulation, people couldn't find it initially, a framework like that. So instead,
what was proposed was that it should be about this weird esoteric object called sheaves.
And so it became known as a geometric Langlands correspondence. But in the last five years or
so, with my two colleagues, Pavel Ettingof and David Kajdan, we were able to find this new
formulation in the geometric setting, in the setting of Riemann surfaces, where in fact,
we do have a Hilbert space, and we do have computing operators, and we can pose the question
of finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. And so it's kind of a new flavor of the Langlands
program. So it's something that really excited me for the last five years. You know, it's so
interesting because for me, it's been like my research has been, it's not been like a linear
path in some sense. So like, for a long time, it was, you know, like when you're young and ambitious,
you want to be the best you can be. And it's all about achieving and kind of like finding your
place in the community and so on. So and so then that was kind of a period of rapid growth.
And then, then at some point, I kind of real, I started asking myself, why am I doing this?
You know, so what am I doing it because I want to achieve something? Recognition or awards?
Or am I doing it really because I love it? You see, and it's not so easy in a later
point in life to regain that, you know, and so there was kind of a period where
I suppose I was a little jaded, you know, maybe about 10 years ago. Well, conveniently around
that time, I wrote my book Love and Math. And so I was in high demand for public speaking and so on.
So it's kind of like it worked out actually, in a way that gave me a little more time to reflect.
And so interestingly enough, I did, I did remember that excitement that I had
as a, as a young, as a student in the teenagers in my early twenties, where I literally, you know,
went to sleep to fall, I want to fall asleep faster. So I could wake up in the morning and resume my,
you know, my inquiry, my, you know, asking those questions and working on this. And so I kind of
regained, I kind of remember this, it was so exciting, you know, so I'm just kind of trying to
give us your sense where I am. This project, especially, which like I said, I've been working
on for about, about five years now. And it's still, it still excites me. And it's still something
that I feel that there are so many interesting questions there that, you know, that draw my attention.
This appetite that you have to be number one, or that you used to have when you were in your
younger years, the striving, you said that you started to question it and think, okay, well,
what am I truly motivated by? That's right. Versus what do I want other people to recognize me for?
When did you start to question that? You mentioned 10 years ago?
Yeah, yeah, maybe about, about 10, about 10 years. Well, about 10 years ago. Well, you know,
after the book gave me a certain framework. Oh, well, thank you.
I read this book cover to cover. And when I say cover to cover, I mean, including the index
and the glossary. Yeah, so I love this book. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Carlton. Thank you,
I appreciate it. The book is called Love and Math, and it'll be in the description. It's
on screen right now if you're watching this on video. The first half is like an ode to
mathematics in general. This is my perspective. So you have your own. And then the last half is some,
I'm surprised if anyone who isn't a mathematician can keep up with the last half. But it's something
that for me, who is extremely interested in math was extremely interested in, especially love the
dictionaries, which by the way are like translation dictionaries. Mathematicians call them dictionaries,
but they're more like translation dictionaries or the sources because you can substitute the words.
Whereas a dictionary is like a word and then you have a longer word that defines it.
Or as a translation dictionary is the Rosetta Stone.
Rosetta Stone, yes. And I do, I do, I do frame it as a Rosetta Stone, right?
And it's, it is about the language program. It's exactly the subject that I, I was just,
you know, I gave a brief outline of just now.
I would love to talk to you about the process of writing this book later on,
this interview as well, if you don't mind.
Yeah, sure, sure. Of course.
But anyway, we're getting to you questioning your own motivations, how that came about,
how that unfolded, and where that led you now.
Yes. So, you know, it's so interesting. Well, you're an artist. So you know how it works. It's
the results, when you actually dedicate yourself to an artistic project,
you cannot know what will come out. And of course, true dedication means that you,
you, it's sincere. It's a sincere effort. You want to connect to your audience, right?
So I wanted to connect to my audience. I wanted them to be excited about the subject.
So what the primary motivation for writing Love and Math for me was that
I thought that nobody knows what mathematics is really about, apart from a very small elite,
a very small group of people, professional mathematicians like myself. And I opened the
book with this analogy of saying, imagine you had an art class in which they only
taught you how to paint fences and walls and never taught you the paintings of the great masters,
never showed them to you, never even told you that they existed, never told you that there
were museums where you could go and look at them. What would you think of art?
The way art is presented to you is just painting fences and walls and then watching paint dry.
So of course, years later, you'll say, art is not for me. Okay. So it's not something I finish.
Yeah, maybe there are these weird people who like painting fences and walls. But if I ever need that,
I will just hire someone to do it. And that's it. So then they completely miss what this is all about.
In both cases, of course, paint is involved, but in very different ways. And so I felt my job was
to try to convey that. What is it about? What are these paintings? What are the Picasso's of
mathematics, you know, and cutting through the, you know, obviously, if you have to, if you are
a math major, you take courses and it takes a long time. But I wanted to address a general
audience of people who don't have time to go and take classes and learn the basics.
And I wanted to cut through those sort of the technical stuff and just get to the sense and
give a sense of what is like. What are the objects, for instance, we're talking about,
we're not talking about numbers necessarily, right? We're not talking about quadratic equations.
We're not talking about Euclidean geometry, all the subjects that we are. It's a very limited part
of mathematics that we get exposed. We talk about symmetry groups. We go talk about braid groups.
We talk about human surfaces. We talk about human spaces, you know, this kind of stuff,
even dimensional stuff. What is this like? What is it also? What is it like to do it? What is it
like? Why did I get excited about it? So I wanted to couple it with a human story. Okay, so that's
the initial motivation. In other words, I set out to write this book to teach something, to teach
the world something, to connect to my readers, to let them experience something which perhaps
they haven't had a chance to experience yet. But in a weird way, what the art does is if you're
successful in connecting to your audience, guess what? You will receive feedback too from the book.
It's a two-way street. This is what's amazing thing about art. With mathematics, by the way,
not quite so because we operate in such, within such, you know, rigid framework, very rigorous
rules and so on. So it's not as, it is a passionate pursuit. But I discovered that, you know,
writing a book or earlier, I had a chance to be involved in filmmaking. And now recently I started,
you know, recording my DJ sets, electronic music. I discovered that this is a totally
different game. And because not only you have a chance to give something
to your audience, but also you receive something. If you are sincere, if you really put, if you
really put your heart to it. And so that in that sense, the book was a revelation for me. I learned
so many things about it. It catalyzed a process of self-inquiry, you could say. Where I start
questioning things about myself, about my life, about my outlook in a very strange way, like it
wasn't programmed in some sense. It was just like happening, you know, and it brought me to, in contact
with people who helped me to accelerate that process. And one of the questions, like, you know,
as I mentioned, one of the questions was indeed, what is this all about? Why am I doing this?
You know, is it real? By that time, I understood that it's not real if it is just driven by ambition
and the desire to be recognized and rewarded. It's not real. It may still be, have a real
undercurrent, but it's not fully real. And the sooner one realizes that, the better.
You know, so that was, that's how I came to that question. But then there were other things too.
I realized to what extent we are driven by our emotions, you know, that scientists would like
to pretend that we are these sterile beings and we're just analyzing this so-called objective
reality, but nothing to do with me. There is this, electrons are weird, but not me. It has nothing to
do with my life, you know. So I suddenly realized how much I'm driven by this undercurrent of emotions
and unconsciously unaware of all those weird processes that are happening in my psyche.
And that's when that brought me to reading a lot of interesting stuff, like Carl Jung is one of my
teachers. I've read a lot of Carl Jung and Marie-Louise Van Frans, one of his students, because, you
know, I love both Jung and Van Frans to me. It's like a source, endless source of inspiration
and, and, and insight. And so then I connected, I started studying Eastern philosophy, you know,
and all this kind of stuff. And so that's, that's what the book catalyzed in me. My own,
so to speak, you know, so my, it kind of ricochets, you know, into, onto ourselves as authors. And
it's a gift, it's a gift. I'd like to add to that. So you mentioned that art is a bit different than
math, because there's more, at least if it's true art, there's an aspect of receiving.
But immediate, immediate, yeah, immediate. It's like a wave, you know, like, it's a
frequent, different frequency. So yes, of course, with math, you also receive eventually. And
Alisson Rothendinger, my hero, my hero. And he obviously was one of the, it was a revolutionary
mathematician of the second half of the 20th century. And then he had, he had an awakening,
one could, one could say, in a kind of traditional Eastern, Eastern, Eastern philosophy sense,
awakening where he realized he was brought, that some questions of human existence and suffering
were really hit him hard and brought, you know, were brought into his attention. And you could
say that that's because he went very deep into mathematics. So it's another portal too. But I
feel it's like it takes longer in some sense. It's like a wave, which is much longer with
whereas the art is fluctuates much faster. And so response time is much faster also.
Carl Jung said that great art is one where you don't know what you're creating when you go into
it. And then by the end of it, you learn something, well, you mentioned learn something about yourself,
but it could be learn something about almost anything. So you shouldn't, if you were to know
what you're doing when you start that he called it propaganda, because you're trying to convince
people of something. Yeah, it's not love. It's not, you're not conveying love, you're conveying power.
And so, right? And so Jung is famous for saying also that where love ends, the power begins and
conversely. It's which I find, I find a very good, you know, way to look at things. In other words,
the impact is real when it is comes from the place of love. It can also be, it can also be
felt when it comes from power, but we know what the results are, eventually. And so
a historical prelude to the Langland's program is the vile conjectures, which he infamously came
up with while he was in jail. So can you please talk about that? Oh, well, Langland's wouldn't
disagree with that because Langland's was not, it was not particularly so. So first of all,
we pronounce his way, we say it way, Andre way, because there is also hell for my wild to make
things even more confusing, right? So there are two great mathematicians who have very similar
names. And then there was also entry wilds. Yes, yes. So for people like myself who read it,
I was confused for the longest time between Andre vile or Andre vile and Andrew vile.
Who comes up? Who comes up with this? And also, I still don't know how to pronounce
heck a operators or heck operators or why you're on a particle site. I don't know,
because I just read them. I think for one year, I called it Lee lie algebras,
instead of lie algebras. That's right. That's right. Yes. So
who writes this script, right? I mean, I don't know. But it's true that there are three mathematicians
with like exceedingly similar names. There is Herman Weil, who was a great German mathematician
who worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, was one of the founding professors or first
professors there. He is the one who was famous and made famous contributions to study groups and
Lee groups specifically and quantum mechanics and so on. And they're also very, very brilliant
philosopher. Then there is Andre vile, who's a French mathematician also ended up working at
the Institute for Advanced Study a little bit later, and he came up with this Bay conjectures.
So his name is spelled W E I L. And in French tradition, we pronounce it way.
Oh, okay. So that's my mistake. Whereas Herman Weil last name is spelled W E Y L.
And in the German tradition, we say while. I just assume everything is German.
Right. So there is also the Andrew viles who proved Hermann's last theorem with Richard Taylor.
So that's more of more contemporary mathematician. So Andre V was a very brilliant
mathematician who came up with this Bay conjectures, one of the most important, most fascinating and
original contributions. He also was the one who
created this framework, came up with this framework of Rosetta Stone of mathematics,
where numbers theory in geometry were connected in a particular way,
which actually gives a good context for understanding the language program.
But it would not necessarily be correct to say that language was motivated by the Bay conjectures.
They're kind of a little bit apart from each other. So language was motivated by other issues.
We can talk about this, but it's maybe a little bit later. So your question was more
about Andrew under Bay or more about Langlands? Well, the way that I understand it is that
even if Langlands didn't see it when he was coming up with his program as an extension of the
veil, sorry, while whale, how do I pronounce it? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, like way,
like way, no way, the way. Okay, this is the way. All right. Yeah, that's right. This is the way.
So the way conjectures that it's seen now. And I think even in your book, you had on the x-axis,
like in this matrix, this translation dictionary, the way conjectures,
but then if you go downward on one of them, you have the Langlands program.
So in a sense, the way conjectures are more general, more encompassing.
Well, but it's not exactly. So there is way conjectures, which is a very specific technical
term for some specific statements. But way conjectures, but way conjectures were an outcome
of a certain overarching framework that Andriy Bey came up with. In your right, he wrote that
letter in 1940 to his sister, Simone Bey, who was a famous philosopher and humanist,
trying to explain his ideas. And that's where he outlined this picture of Rosetta Stone,
so to speak. The way conjectures were an outcome for him from that conceptual understanding of how
things fit in mathematics, that he was able to argue by analogy. So you have Riemann hypothesis
in number theory. And because he had this framework that where he could move things
from number theory to other domains, then he said, what would Riemann hypothesis look like
in this domain? And it came up with way conjectures, more or less. So what matters here, if we talk
about the Langlands program is not way conjectures themselves, which is a very particular application
of that general overarching framework. But the framework itself, the framework itself helps you
see how the Langlands program can play out in different domains. That's what that's the point
I was trying to make in my book. And Wei, Andre Wei, right. Andre Wei also, he gave an analogy of
curves, points and surfaces as being different avatars of Vishnu. So can you please tell the
audience about that as well? Oh, yes. So this is very interesting. So Andre Wei was very attuned
to the Eastern tradition and he actually visited India and I think lectured at the Tata Institute
fundamental science in Bombay, Mumbai. And so in his letter to his sister, which was written in 1940,
he talks about how mathematicians perceive this analogies. And so it's kind of a very interesting,
I don't know if I should actually, I have my book here, so I don't know if I could,
if I should actually quote this quote is here somewhere. And he mentions Abhagavad Gita,
Abhagavad Gita, which is a kind of a sacred text of Hinduism. So, and he says,
when you get an insight, you just kind of an inkling of an idea, as opposed to when it's already
understood. He talks about this dialectics of the experience of passing from that moment of
recognition. But you're not sure yet, you just start seeing the outline and then when it's actually
already done. And it's something very interesting because like you fall in love kind of, you know,
kind of like, so you wouldn't, you would, most people probably would least expect a mathematician
to be so poetic about it, about the nature of discovery in mathematics. But he says,
so what happened, it is a translation into English. So when, what happens when this
inkling of an analogy between two theories turned into concrete knowledge, he says,
gone are the two theories, gone are their troubles and delicious, delicious reflections in one
another, their furtive caresses, their inexplicable quarrels. Alas, we have but one theory now,
whose majestic beauty can no longer excite us. So the excitement comes from that
moment, recognition, he's basically saying, nothing is more fertile than this illicit
liaisons. Nothing gives more pleasure to the connoisseur. This initial moment of discovery,
this initial moment of insight. And he says, the pleasure comes from the illusion and the kindling
of the senses. Once the illusion disappears and knowledge is acquired, we attain indifference.
In the Bhagavad Gita, there are some, there are some lucid verses to this effect. And then he goes,
but let's go back to the algebraic function. So in other words, there is this depth of
understanding. So mathematics does give one this vantage point, I suppose, which is very poetic,
and one could say romantic. And I can, I can, I can feel that visually what he's talking about,
because, you know, coming up with a discovery, mathematics does feel like that. But so does
everything else. Falling love is kind of like this. Although one could say it's not necessarily that
you kind of attain indifference of once it's settled, it settles. The idea is that
that's the difference between, you know, human relationship, which is, which is living, which
can live and evolve and transform itself and reinvent itself forever or for a long time.
In mathematics, once the theory is completed, in some sense, it's already fixed. It doesn't grow.
It can grow then the next level and so on. But there is a, indeed, there is a sense of indifference.
So that's kind of connected to what I was talking about, the difference between art and
mathematics. In art, in some sense, there is a more of a living, it's more of a living thing.
Yes, yes. Something that's popular nowadays is to say that there is no theory of everything.
And in part, they'll quote Feynman and say, well, it's supposed to be like an onion,
even though onions are finite, they have like 10 to 20 layers. So that's actually,
it's a poor analogy, because we've revolutionized physics maybe 10 to 20 times in different ways.
So we should be at the core, but also that there's something romantic about it,
about there not being a theory of everything, because if there was, then we think the ultimate
questions are done. But the theory of everything in physics has a certain meaning of like reconciling
dynamic space time with quantum theory. And so that's not exactly like the answers to everything,
quote unquote. But even if there was, it could be that the answer to everything, quote unquote,
is something that's animated. So it could be something like at the bottom of, I know this is
extremely poetic to say, but it could be like the theory of everything is to live lovingly,
in which case it's not like an apprehensible, timeless, dead fact, like certain theorems are.
But rather something to rather a process rather than a state.
I agree that it's a process. It's a process. It's a process. The connotation I think most people
have a theory of everything is that it's something static that is done. And
and then we have this know that this knowledge, which somehow will cover everything.
And that is very counterproductive in my view. And even I would say dangerous and has unfortunately
impeded progress and cause a lot of suffering to scientists, but not only because it's the mindset
if we because today people trust scientists to be the forward looking and kind of like more advanced
the way they used to look up to theologians or priests or poets or artists now
for better or for worse, it's a scientist who are the priests, so to speak, in this era.
And so if we are confused about this, if we entertain this
ideas, that they propagate to a general culture. And this what happened in some sense,
this idea of insatiable, in my view, this insatiable appetite for trying to explain everything with
the knowledge I have right now. If you think about it, this is absurd. And all the history of
humanity shows that it's absurd. And yet the impulse so strong. And I'm not going to say it's
those other people have to. It's me. I have been like this all my life, up until maybe very recently.
So I know exactly how tempting this is. I also know how counterproductive
it is and how much suffering comes from it. So like, you know, it's entertaining. It's kind of
fun to engage in this activity. But I think it's a it's a very important and I'm glad you're I'm
speaking about this on the podcast, which is called theories of everything, which is a bit paradoxical.
But I think that you actually get it kind of, you know, it's kind of half tongue in cheek,
the way you call it. And you don't call it theory of everything. Right? You call it theories of
everything. So it's not as simple as one might one might think. That's the observant mathematician
in you. That's why they pay me the big bucks, you know. Yeah, exactly. Not really. Yeah. I think
that the drive to come up with a theory of everything isn't even though people would say, well, I
would care about humanity and I want to solve global problems. I don't think it's that I think it's
the desire to be crowned the title of the next Einstein. Yeah, so it's ego, ego driven, ego
driven. So we can agree on that. Yeah, of course, to me, that means that you're not the next Einstein,
because Einstein never cared about being the next Einstein, because there was no
and also something I think about when people say so and so is the next Einstein, we generally think
of it in terms of, okay, are they creating something that's a paradigm shift in physics or math?
But yeah, it's unclear to me if Einstein was to be born today. Would he be doing physics and math?
So he was a creative, tuneful, poetic, romantic person. Maybe he would, maybe the next Einstein
is Christopher Nolan. Also, he played, also he played violin. He played violin. Yes, yeah. So
literally, maybe he would be violinist. Yeah, Yoyo Ma, maybe Yoyo Ma is the next Einstein. That's a
good point. The term theory of everything is, let's unpack this, because I think you've tongue
in cheek called the Langley's program, a grand unified theory, which some people then take to say
it's a theory of everything of math. Of mathematics, yes, because you know, I was like,
how come physicists always talk about grand unified theories? This, I literally, I gave a colloquium
in Princeton, and that's when I first came up with this. It was kind of like, on this program
moment, I was like, how come physicists always, always talk about grand unified theories, but
we mathematicians don't. And actually, Langley's was sitting in the audience. And I said, well,
guess what? I would like to call the Langley's program the grand unified theory of mathematics
and all laughing. Because of course, it doesn't make sense because mathematics is just so diverse.
It cannot have a nobody wants to have a theory of everything. And then I said, well, maybe it
doesn't describe everything, but at least it describes something. So it's kind of a little, you
know, like, so that's how it came about. Well, in a sense, math already has a theory of everything.
What I mean by that is, it's the axioms. So it's just, it's not interesting to anyone.
Why I say that is that in physics, but axioms, but axioms, now you're trading on a very
explain. In other words, the toll in physics is what are all those principles from which
all observations slash theories are emergent slash effective. That is what we measure in the
lab are just corollaries of these axioms. If we knew the axioms, like the driver theory of
everything in physics is what is the axioms of nature. And so in math, I know that there's
some controversies to it. But in math, we don't know what the axioms are either. That's a whole
point. That's a whole point, which is lost. Usually people don't realize because most people think
mathematics is written in stone. So of course, it's so predetermined. No, it's not. It is a very
important issue. In the way I like to talk about it is that, you know, there is an observer problem
in mathematics, just like quote unquote, or measurement problem mathematics, just like in
quantum physics, where the observer is involved in quantum physics. We know that from experiments.
In mathematics, it is much less, much easier to miss. And where it comes is, there's several
places where it comes. But one of the most essential ones is who chooses the axioms. There
isn't one axiomatic system, which is God given. And even great mathematicians like Kurt Gödel,
for example, apparently he did believe that there is a kind of ultimate correct system.
And then he thought that his job as a mathematician was to find it. In other words,
it is somewhere there in some platonic world, and you have to go and find it. But it's not
obvious at all which one it is. So it's just the way you frame the search for it. In other words,
you may think that there is one special one, but you don't know what it is. And you devote,
dedicate your life to finding it. Another alternative position is plurality, kind of
multiverse of axioms. So there are various axiomatic systems, they lead you to different
mathematics. And it's very interesting to analyze what are the differences, which is more fruitful,
which is less fruitful. So then you can say, okay, well, there must be some objective criteria as to
which a system of axioms is better. And the weird thing is that there isn't even consistency,
cannot serve as a criterion, because the second incompleteness theorem of Kurt Gödel
shows that a formal system, that's kind of a
assemblage of all the statements that you can get out of a particular system of axioms.
Formal system cannot prove its own consistency. You have to step out of it. You have to step
out of it. You have to add a joint some other axioms to be able to speak about consistency.
Consistency means that it's useful. You can't prove everything. And consistency
means that every statement, it can be derived. So it derives contradictions, it can derive
statement A, and then it's negation. And if that's the case, then it's true for every other statement.
So it means that it proves everything, so then it's useless. Yeah, you actually don't want to
be able to prove everything, because then it's trivial. That's right. You have to prove only
some select statements. And that is a property of a formal system called consistency. And the
point is that the system cannot prove its own consistency. So then how you cannot be sure,
even that it's consistent, you have to take it on faith. And that's where the observer comes. So
then how does Kurt Gödel, for instance, how would he decide which system is the God-given one?
Because he did believe, apparently, that there was a correct one that you had to find.
And obviously, you do it on other principles, like aesthetic principles,
this principle of beauty, principles of being concise, and stuff like that. But that's where
you, as a first person, your first person perspective becomes imprinted on this. Because
there isn't an objective criterion, ultimately. There isn't. So the other possibility, which
is resnice with me, is this idea, which is, there is a philosopher, Penelope Madi, who has
written about this, and I really like the way she frames it. It's maximal practice. The system is,
the better system is the one which is more fruitful, which allows you to prove more things.
And this is some, but it's beautiful, because it means, but who decides it's us, the living
mathematicians today, we decide, because we're practicing mathematicians, we're applying those
axioms in our practical work. And then it becomes a marketplace of axioms, a system of axioms, if
you will. They compete with each other as different stories, so to speak. And we choose the ones which
are more fruitful, which give us more diverse, more beautiful mathematics. So in other words,
we're deciding it right now, not referring to authority of Pythagoras, or Kurt Gödel, or Bertrand
Russell, or some such great individual, but it's up to us. That's where mathematics becomes a living
process. So in that sense, one has to be careful to say that whether mathematics is based on some
unassailable foundation. It's not. If you look more closely, it's actually very similar to
other subjects of human endeavor, or other parts of science, for instance, like physics and so on.
And I agree with you that in a way, you almost, you could say that the job of a physicist is to
try to find the axioms of the physical world of this universe. So we don't see the laws themselves,
we observe the ramifications. Or at least some, or at least some of them, right? So then,
but in mathematics, actually, it's the same, but it's much more difficult to notice it unless you
actually are a practicing mathematician, because the way mathematics is perceived by the general
public is that it is something where nothing ever changes. And the foundation is also perceived
by many mathematicians. And actually, I personally have not really thought about it deeply until
recently, because I think it's very common in general that you find something that interests
you, like for me, a language program, you can work on language program without
questioning the foundation. The reason I question the foundation is because of my interest in
philosophy, perhaps it's because of public public speaking, kind of doing interviews like
conversations like this, where these kinds of questions would come up and I would really be
curious. So I'm really interested in those philosophical underpinnings of mathematics.
But a lot of people, as you know, they actually claim that philosophy is completely useless for
science. We shall not name any names, right? Yes, yes, yes. I will put an image on screen.
I disagree. I disagree violently with this position. I think it's very limiting. And I think there are
probably some parts of science where, you know, you can get by, but I think we all benefit from
opening our horizon and from being interested in the foundations of what we are doing. This is
called self-awareness, right? And what are you doing? So in other words, the public has the
perception that there's the practical aspect of science, so STEM, science, technology, engineering,
mathematics, and the practical side of the first three letters, the science, the technology, the
engineering, and physics is seen as a pure form of engineering. And then the most purest form of
physics or the purest form of science is math. And that's something that's extremely objective.
But you're saying, well, in order for us to establish something mathematically, we have to
agree on the axioms. When we do so, we generally do so with practical concerns, like empiricism.
And so there's something that's about... Or you're driven by your Platonist. If you are a Platonist,
which means that you believe that mathematical ideas exist in this ideal domain, this Platonic
world, which is outside of space and time and so on, which I respect this position. And I actually,
to some extent, adhere to this position when I was writing Love and Math.
Then also you have your own methodology. You're searching for the correct one
in that Platonic realm, which is also... It's a methodology. But there has to be some kind
of methodology for you too, because there is no objective methodology. You cannot even use
consistency as a tool, because it cannot prove its own consistency. So you have to take it on faith.
It's a very practical thing. For instance, you have the Z of C, the standard axiomatics
of set theory. Set is the most fundamental notion in modern mathematics, introduced by
German mathematician, Georg Cantor. And actually, it's never been defined. So this is already a
place where a whole of mirrors. We pretend that it is something that is concrete and definite.
But in fact, there is no definition of it. There are only circular definitions. Cantor himself
gave a very poetic definition. He said, a set is a collection of many that thinks of itself as one.
You see. So it's a poetic definition. Now, in other words, here's a notion which we accept on faith.
Then you have the axiomatics, which was developed in the first half of the 20th century and has
become sort of a staple. So you kind of a lot of mathematicians follow it, even if you're not
aware. It's called ZFC. Z for Zermelo and one mathematician, F for Frankel, almost the same
spelling as my name. No connection as far as I know. And C is the axiom of choice. So ZFC.
Now, we do not know that it is consistent. We can prove its consistency from another system,
which is a bigger system where you introduce additional axioms. But you don't know whether
that system is consistent. And like this other infinite. So how can we then do mathematics?
You ask, well, we accept it on faith. People don't talk about it. And most people,
practically, my mission never actually thought about it deeply. But if you think about it,
and it's all information is available, I'm not saying something that is not known. Everybody
knows it. Certainly logicians know it. And the point is that we take it on faith that it is
consistent. Because if you don't, then how can you do mathematics without assuming that it is
consistent, you see? Yes. If it's not consistent means that you can prove anything by from the
axioms, including contradictory statements, right? So there is this element of faith,
even in mathematics, there is an element of fiction, there is an element of story. And I
think it's a very important observation because it points us, again, to the importance of the
first person perspective. Science of 19th century tried to expunge first person perspective,
even earlier science. And the whole point of science was to come up with this narrative
that somehow there is a subjective reality, and we are just detached observers, we are not
participant in it. Science of 20th century, physics of 20th century put an end to this
through quantum mechanics, through Einstein's relativity theory, where the observer is involved
and cannot be separated from what the observer is observing. But then you could say, well,
at least mathematics is objective. And so my point is, it's not, it's more camouflage,
it's better camouflage. Your current deliberation is that it's all subjective,
or it's an intermingling of subjective and objective? It's always intermingling, of course,
because, but the point is that there is no objective core, there is no, there isn't something,
there's a strong foundation. There is, you know, like people, somebody who's not a mathematician
may think, obviously, there are some axioms in mathematics which have existed forever,
and nobody questions them. That's not true. The simplest example of this is non-Euclidean geometry.
Euclide actually was the first one to come up with a functional system of axioms,
what we call formal system of Euclidean geometry. It's about 2,300 years ago, of course, building
on earlier works by Pythagoras and Pythagoreans, where he came up with a list of five axioms
and tried to derive hundreds of different statements in his book Elmets, a series of books,
derived from those axioms. Now, the first four axioms were kind of
natural, and the fifth axiom was about parallel lines, that if you have a line on the plane,
so Euclidean geometry, as I'm sure everybody knows, since this is actually one subject that is
studied in school, it's about the plane. Plane means a tabletop extended to infinity in all directions,
and on that plane, we have points, we have lines, we have circles, we have triangles,
and then the intersect, and there are all kinds of statements that you want to make. For instance,
Pythagoras' theorem, that you have a right triangle and the square of the hypotenuse is
equal to the sum of squares of two other sides. This is the type of statements that we're talking
about, which you would like to deduce or derive from a small number of axioms. But then how do
you choose these axioms? The first one, you want them to be non-contradictory, that's consistency
that I talked about, and yet you want them to be broad enough so that you can derive many interesting
things. So he came up with these five axioms, and the fifth axiom was the one which kind of looked
weird, and it stated that if you have a line on the plane and you have a point outside of this line,
then there is a unique line passing through it, which is parallel to the original one.
Parallel means that they never intersect. So there is one and it's unique.
And after that, for centuries, people tried to derive this fifth axiom. They used to call it
fifth postulate from the first form. And they all failed for about 2,000 years,
when several mathematicians around the same time said, what if we replace it with another axiom,
where either you say there are no such lines, and there was every line that passes through this point,
intersects the original line, or you say that there are infinitely many lines, not one,
which do not intersect. And this way you get what's called non-euclidean geometry.
The first example, now when you say axioms, when you talk about euclidean geometry,
you have to make it very detached from reality. So we have a model of this euclidean geometry,
where we really think of lines and dots and circles and triangles. But when you formulate
things in mathematics in the formal system, it has to be completely detached from reality.
It's almost all syntactic. It's just symbolic manipulation. So you don't necessarily have
to refer to a particular model for it. So then you say, well, in my experience on the plane,
I can't imagine that there is no parallel line passing through another point. But you don't
have to look on the plane. You can look on the sphere. And on the sphere, the role of lines is
played by meridians, and every two meridians intersect. So in other words, the formal system
doesn't care about how you want to model it. Formal system only cares about things like consistency,
whether these axioms contradict each other or not. And it turns out that if you replace the
fifth axiom of euclide with another statement, it turns out that it's still in this case,
we can actually prove its consistency because it's kind of some from without doing much.
So it is actually independent from the other axioms. And you can actually replace it by its
negation. And you'll still get a consistent system. And that system can be realized either on the sphere.
That's the kind of spherical geometry where every two instead of but it's not a line,
it's a meridian, which plays the role of the line. So you take all the statements about lines in
euclide, but they replace lines by meridians, meaning big circles on the on the sphere. It
doesn't mean this has to go through Norse and South Pole. You could have any any big circle
is a lot is what plays a role of a line in spherical geometry. And if you replace the axiom
in the opposite direction, you say that in infinitely many lines, which do not intersect,
you get what's called hyperbolic geometry. So it's a geometry on hyper on a hyperboloid where
the the role of the of the lines is played by hyperbolic. And then you can see that there are
infinitely many hyperbolic which do not intersect. Okay, so this is a good illustration
of the fallacy of the idea that there is one axiomatic system which services all of mathematics,
which is has been given to us somehow that the way the tablets, you know, the 10 commandments
were given to Moses. That's just that's just not the case at all. However, it doesn't mean that
it's not a postmodernist position either that anything goes. This is what I also try to explain
to my students always, because the next temptation is to say, okay, it's all fiction.
Yes, that's what it sounds like. Then what are we talking about? But the point is that there is
practice. These axioms, they don't nobody needs these axioms if you're not going to apply them to
actually prove statements and make progress in mathematics and different. And it's not true
that all axiomatic systems are created equal. No, in some of them, you get a lot of interesting
stuff done. And in some of them, it's somewhat not limiting. And a good example of this is whether
you accept the existence of infinity, the existence of infinite sets, like the set of
natural numbers, one, two, three, four, five, and so on, as a totality, not just infinity light,
that for every number, there is a number greater by one, this is called potential infinity.
But you accept absolute infinity that there is such a thing as a collection of all natural numbers.
This is a very, it seems like a small thing, but actually leads to a lot of paradoxical statements
like the famous Hilbert Hotel, you know, where you have infinitely many rooms, and then you can
always accommodate more people because you could shift them all by one to the next room,
and then freeing up, freeing up. There was very paradoxical behavior. So now,
what is the status of this statement of existence of absolute infinity?
It's actually an axiom. It's not cannot be derived from anything. It isn't one of the axioms in ZFC,
in this axiomatic system that I talked about, Zermelo-Franco, axiom of choice.
And there are mathematicians, which are called infinitists, who refuse to accept this axiom.
So they can see the ZFC without the axiom of infinity. And then the race is on. Okay, so here,
99% of mathematicians who accept infinity, and they work with this axiom, whether they're aware of
it or not. Okay. And here is a small group of mathematicians who refuse to accept this axiom,
and they work with ZFC minus infinity. This is very real. I'm not making this up. This is how.
Yes, yes, yes. This is our current situation. Yeah, I've spoken to some people who dislike
the axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice, Norman Weilberger and... Sure.
And Jorbar Nathen. Do you know Jorbar Nathen?
Dror. Yeah, of course I know Dror. Okay, well, we'll speak about him afterward. But anyway,
continue. Yeah. This is very interesting. How do you decide? How do you decide which is correct
and which is not? So my point is, this is a market of ideas. You know, this is a market of
formal system, market of formal systems. You show me what you can do with your formal system,
and I'll show you what I can do with my formal system. People will look at this and they will
decide which way they want to go. For now, maybe somebody else will come over the third system
of axioms, which will be superior to both and so on. I don't want to do it on ideological grounds.
You see, and this is where a lot of people go astray today in today's science. They pretend
that they are not ideological. They pretend that they're not driven by their metaphysical
preferences, ontological preferences. For instance, that I like local determinism,
or I dislike local determinism. And then I am willing to sacrifice this and this and this
for that particular thing, aspect of a theory. But it's not because it's my preference,
it's just a better theory. No, it doesn't work this way. You have to detach yourself from your
ideology. If you want to do good science, in my opinion, which in this particular scenario that
I'm talking about, and it's not a scenario, it's a reality of modern mathematics, you have a small
number of people who refuse to take axiom of infinity. Now, my feeling is that there is something
deep in their psychology, which rebels against the idea of infinity. They believe it's not real,
and they would like to do mathematics according to this ideology. Okay, I accept also that on the
contrary, I like the idea of infinity. To me, infinity mathematics symbolizes transcendence,
symbolizes something that is beyond logical reason in some sense. But we formalize it in
mathematics as an infinite set, you see? Interesting. And I admit, I admit, okay, I admit that I
confession time, drawn. Yes, I confess, I'm drawn to it because of my psychological composition.
That's what it is. It's my preference, my psychological preference, my aesthetic preference,
my ontological, philosophical preference, like you don't mind the paradoxes that come about. In fact,
they're welcome. But it cannot be, but the whole point of science that we do not resolve our disputes
on ideological ground. This is not a fertile approach. This is not a fruitful approach. There's
a much better way to do it. I will do, I will do, I will work with the system of axioms,
which is closer to me, to my psychological, philosophical, you know, metaphysical ideas.
But I should not be judged on that. I will, me and my colleagues who accept the infinity,
we will work and we will produce results. And my colleagues who do not accept the infinity,
we'll work and produce results and we'll compare. And then we will see in the next generation,
young mathematicians who are not yet burdened by all this ideology, they will look and this,
and they will, you know how they say, vote with your legs, with your feet, they will go in the
direction which is more fruitful. That is real science, in my opinion. That's how you resolve it.
You resolve it. Now the problem is that you can have people who are blocking that process. For
instance, let's suppose somebody is attracting a lot of resources to their theory, you know,
because they say it's correct. Then it puts others at disadvantage. So I think that's unfair.
So everybody has to have a chance to develop things unless it's clearly like wrong, inconsistent.
Do you have an example in mind when you're saying this? Oh, yes.
Many examples are just one in particular. One very special example. I'll get to it. So for
instance, what skinnities do, it does not resonate with me. It does not resonate with me because I
think because, you know, I'll tell you why. So they basically accept only finite set
because they exclude this action. So okay. But then you can prove, for example,
that within their formal system, you cannot prove some statements even about finite sets.
In other words, some statements about finite sets, you can only prove if you accept the
axiom of infinity. That's the weird paradoxical aspect of it. You can actually prove that you
cannot prove that you cannot prove some statement of finite sets. So to me, it means a straight
jacket. You put a straight jacket on yourself. You limit yourself. Why? Simply because you don't
like the idea of infinity. Well, okay. Why limit yourself? So that's my view. But I respect them.
And I would like, for instance, there is a project to try to re-prove various statements. For
instance, Fermat's last year, proof of the last theorem. Try to write a proof which never uses
infinite sets. There's a project on which several very distinguished logicians, you know, mathematicians
have worked on. And I, last time I looked, it's inconclusive. They don't claim that they can do
it. But there are some other famous problems in mathematics that they were able to prove
without appealing to infinity. And I applaud that because at the end of the day, it's also helpful
to know what is a minimal set of requirements for you to prove something. Okay. But ultimately,
I think the correct argument why the theory with the axiom of infinity is superior today
to the system of axioms without infinity is that we can produce a lot more. And there are many
statements which are not known to be derivable without axiom infinity. There are many states
in which we know cannot be derived without axiom of infinity and so on. So therefore, it becomes
limiting to our progress. And you know, also the other thing I want to say is that today,
there are algorithms based on elliptic curve encryption, stuff like that, which is actually
used in the Bitcoin blockchain, for instance. And it's not clear to me whether the mathematical
theorems which underpin these algorithms can be proved without axiom infinity. So in fact,
if that is the case, effectively, it means that it becomes part of our life. The infinity finds a
backdoor into our life through various theoretical statements on which our technology is based.
Now, I'm not claiming that that's the case. But that's how, for instance,
that's how it can actually affect us because somebody could say, okay, this is some really
zoteric argument between these weird mathematicians, like who cares? You care because technology is
woven into the fabric of our lives to such an extent that, yes, a lot of very hard, difficult
mathematics is now being used in, for instance, in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. And
that's just one example. Okay, we're going to get to examples. These examples I have given were to
to illustrate the point that number one is mathematics is also based on there is a choice
involved. But number two, so in other words, there is a subjective element.
And this is only one. So just a brief addition to this, this is one way in which
the observer is involved. The first person perspective is involved. The other one is,
of course, when we write proofs, who decides if it is correct or not? We are not yet at the
stage of full automation of verification of proofs. And eventually, probably some of it
can be done by computers. It's not there yet. So it's human mathematicians who are reading those
papers and ascertaining whether the proof is correct or not. A famous example is Andrew Wiles,
we talked about earlier. His original proof of Fermat's last theorem had a gap. How was it found
it was found by the gap was found by by mathematician Nicholas Katz, who was Andrew Wiles
colleague at Princeton University, who looked very carefully and he asked a question probing
questions that you finally ask a question, how does this follow from this? And Andrew Wiles could
not answer it. So it was determined that there is a gap. And luckily, a year later, Andrew Wiles,
with the help of his former student Richard Taylor, was able to close this gap. And after that,
so what gives us the confidence that the proof is correct? What if there is another gap?
We cannot be 100% sure this is a point. It is accepted as a true proof by other practicing
mathematicians. That's the market of ideas that I'm talking about. Even in mathematics,
you have this market of ideas. There isn't something that is objective and completely
detached from our personalities, from our real living breathing mathematicians.
That is something that is very important. And it's an indication that even mathematics is like
this. Then for sure, it's like this in many other subjects, which do not even have the
appearance of this objective reality, of objective reality, right? Mathematics does have
the appearance of objective reality more so than any other subject in science, in my opinion.
But what I'm trying to argue is that it's an illusion at the bottom of it.
There is a choice that are choices made by living mathematicians. Okay, that's the first point.
The second point, however, it doesn't mean that anything goes. It doesn't mean that anyone come
up with some fancy mathematical objects. There is a notion of a group. It's one of the cornerstones
of mathematics, a notion of a group. A group is like a symmetry. It's a collection of symmetries
operating on a particular object, like a glass around glass, all rotations of the glass.
It is encapsulated by some axioms, where you have some binary operations, such and such
associativity being the most important one. What if somebody comes up and replace associativity
with something else, some different property? And actually, people try to do that.
Guess what? Groups are fundamental. Those other things are not. Why? Because groups have led
to very important advances. They have applications in many areas. And those other fancy objects
don't. And that's how that's why mathematicians work on groups and not on those other things,
which to detach the absorber who is not involved in the subject, we look, okay, so in this axiom,
you have three terms, and this, you have four terms. What's the difference? They look very
similar. But we choose one and not the other for a reason. And that is the objective element,
you see, because it comes now from the community of mathematicians working on it,
applying it to different areas. And there's a criterion of fruitfulness. That's what replaces
objectivity in some sense. But it's a notion which is accepted today by the community. Maybe
one of those fancy objects that we don't pay attention to today, because we think that they're
useless, maybe somebody will find applications for them in a few years, and then they will become,
a lot of people will work on that, you see. But it's a process. It's a process. So there is
an obviously there is no theory of everything in this process. Or if there are many, maybe there
are many. How do we overcome this, then need or this fallacy of confusing some things effectiveness,
it's ubiquitous application with this ontological status. So this is something that
computationalists do, where they see the effectiveness of computers, and they say, well,
then at the basis of reality is computers. Yeah, that's right. Or some people, well,
I have several examples in mind. This, absolutely. And that's why I am, that's why I devote time
to talk about this, because this is one of the policies that you said that I have in mind.
I think that this discussion of what mathematics is about is very much relevant to understanding
why there's a policy. We have to overcome this temptation to believe that the knowledge we
have acquired is sufficient to explain everything, or at least like a large portion of reality.
This has never worked. It has never worked and never will work in my opinion. And case in point,
computation, a lot of people today say that everything is computation. And what do they mean
by this? So they learned computation, they think they've learned computer science or computer
mathematics. Yeah. And it's, it's a child who learned trigonometry, 11 year old who learned
trigonometry. And now he sees trigonometry in everything. Look, there is a wheel,
it's trigonometry. Look at the triangle, it's trigonometry. Everything is trigonometry.
It's a very natural and almost endearing quality of human beings. But unfortunately leads us astray.
And I think that maybe time has come for us to finally let go of this, of this approach.
And for instance, in the case of computation, since you mentioned, it's something that,
which is very much relevant today, because all the computer, so-called AI,
all these computer programs that charge GPD and so on.
I have spent some time reading the founders, like Alan Turing. Okay. So Alan Turing is
credited as the father of modern computation, creating the framework for modern computation,
proving the most important result. What was the most important result that he immediately proved
after he came up with his idea of encapsulating computation as a Turing machine? It was a statement
that there are things which are not computable by Turing machines. In other words, computation,
the paradigm of computation contains within itself its own demise, the realization that it's
not everything. And the great ones, in this case, the founder Alan Turing, one of the smartest people
who have ever lived, he saw it right away and he did not see it as a bug. He saw it as a feature.
And if you read his work, it's an incredibly deep and honest, sincere analysis of what it means,
or what its implications are, because of course, he was fascinated with the idea of thinking machines,
of intelligent machines. But if you read his paper on intelligent machines, I actually have it somewhere.
So first of all, he writes in 1945, the class of problems capable of solutions by the machine
can be defined fairly specifically. They are a subset of those problems which can be solved by
human clerical labor, working to fix rules and without understanding, without understanding.
Now, intelligence, by the way, comes from the word intelligere, which means to understand.
How can we talk about intelligence of computers when the father of computing considered the point
that they're not understanding what they're doing? How many computer scientists are aware?
So computer scientists who speak out on this and say, we already entered the age of AI,
it's going to take over human beings, if we are lucky, they will use it as as plants,
you know, as decorations in their homes and so on. How many of them are even aware of this quote?
That's my first question. Yes. Okay, my second question.
A few questions here. So my second question. So here's another paper in which, which is,
which is called, which is called intelligent machinery. I think it's called intelligent
machinery. And he talks about objections to the possibility of intelligent machines.
He says, the original question can machines think is too meaningless to deserve discussion.
Nevertheless, I believe that at the end of the century, the use of words and general
educated opinion will have altered so much that, that one will be able to speak to much of machine
thinking without expecting to be contradicted. You see, we'll have what so much? I believe that
at the end of the century, and that means 20th century, the use of words and general educated
opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machine thinking without
expecting to be contradicted. In other words, he's basically saying that's not a good way to phrase
it, but he's resigned to the fact that that's how people will talk about it. Right? Yes.
I believe further that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs,
by concealing. So by concealing these beliefs, the popular view that scientists proceed inexorably
from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any unproved
conjecture is quite mistaken. You see, conjectures are of great importance since they suggest
useful lines of research. So for him, from the beginning, the possibility of intelligent machines
was a conjecture. And now he says, and now he says, I now proceed to consider opinions opposed to
my own. And he comes up, he comes up, listen to this, he comes up, not with one, not with two,
he comes up with nine objections, nine objections. And he carefully considers each
and every one of them. And the one which he finds most powerful is what he calls mathematical
objection, the fact that he himself showed that there are problems which are not decidable,
which are not computable, which are not solvable by machine, by computer.
This is a very important point. It's called halting problem. The halting problem, when he
realized that it cannot be solved by the question, which Turing machines will halt,
which Turing machines will not go into loop? Because you couldn't enumerate all the Turing
machines. And I can ask whether there is an algorithm or a Turing machine, which will, which
will. Does the halting problem implicitly have an idea of the concept of infinity? Yes. Yes.
So the objection would be, well, hey, we just get rid of the infinity.
You can't get rid of it. That's the point. You even, you have to accept at least potential
infinity because otherwise the position is untenable. Otherwise, your position is that there
is a biggest number and an n plus one does not exist. This, even Finitists today, they would not
agree with. Finitists do not say that there isn't a number greater by one than any given number,
meaning there is a billion, there's a billion and one, there's a gazillion, there's a gazillion and
one. Okay. They don't, they don't argue with that. That's called potential infinity. What they argue
about is whether there is such a thing as a totality of all positive natural numbers,
whether it exists as a thing in and of itself. For them, what exists is always a finite set of
numbers from one to n or from one to n plus one, from one to n plus two and so on, but not from
one to infinity. That is, it seems like a subtle difference, but that is what separates Finitists
from the rest of mathematicians. It's that. Finitists will now, and I don't know of any
mathematician who actually seriously entertains the idea that there is a biggest number.
Yeah. Because you know that there is a number and there is also number one and there is no
operational, additional number. So how can it not give you n plus one? You see? So therefore,
you cannot avoid potential infinity. You can avoid absolute infinity, which is what Finitists do,
by saying that the set of all natural numbers does not exist. Only it's finite subsets at any
moment. That is a reasonable position, but they still cannot avoid the fact that for a number,
there isn't one more. And that is what gives Calting problem. You don't need to assume absolute
infinity for it at all. Just the thing that the machine runs. If it stops, you're in luck.
But what if it doesn't stop? It means that in finite time, you cannot decide whether it stops.
You see? That is the cornerstone of the impossibility of solving the Calting problem.
Infinity is underneath it, but it's an infinity light. It's a potential infinity.
I was speaking with Dror Barnaton. He's an ultra-finitist. So I asked him explicitly,
do you believe the number five to the power 100 to the power 100 to the power 200 doesn't exist?
And he paused and thought about it. He said, no, it doesn't exist.
Okay. And yet you just described it. So that's very interesting. It doesn't exist.
Yet you just named it. So what did you name?
Yes. Well, you named a unicorn.
You named something, right?
Yeah. But anyway, I could be misquoting him or misremembering. So who knows? But there are
ultra-finitists. Maybe. I don't know. I think it's a bit of a
if I may say so, a little bit of posturing. It's a bit of posturing.
So professor, this seems, I see the same passion that you have for math,
that you have for this subject, this new philosophical subject.
No, for sure. When did this start? This also started 10 years ago?
Yes. So this started with the questioning of what am I doing this for?
Is it correlated? It's very much correlated, very much correlated.
Yeah. So I was going to say, yes. So I wanted to say what I quoted. I wanted to say which
source it's called computing machinery and intelligence. It's an article during growth in 1950.
Okay. And so where he gives nine, he gives nine objections
to his own ideas and he analyzes them carefully. How many computer scientists do you know today
who, number one, aware of the fact that Turing was trying to grapple with these issues
from the outset. And he was very uneasy about them. Right? Yes. How many computer scientists
and proponents of AI, so to speak, or like acolytes of AI, how many of them actually aware
what the father of their subject was thinking about it? And it's number two, how many of them
put in their papers objections to their own ideas and seriously engage with those objections
instead of dismissing them outright. I'm not sure how many will answer
yes to both questions. I'm not sure. And that is, we say troubling. So we say
disconcerting. Why is it that the father of the subject felt imperative upon himself
to engage critics in a very serious way and sincere way? And by the way, he was in dialogue with
Gödel because it's very connected to Gödel's incompleteness. And he was aware, was aware right
away of this and Gödel too. And even years later, so Turing died in 1954, in 1973, Gödel decided to
add a remark to his earlier paper in which he argues with Turing. So it's kind of
it's kind of weird because you could say kind of unfair because Turing cannot respond.
But I think it's on the contrary, it shows the great respect of Gödel for Turing. So he writes,
a philosophical error in Turing's work, Turing, Gödel writes, and this is, I think, I believe in
1973, 74. And he says, Gödel, Kurt Gödel says, Turing in his 1937 paper gives an argument which is
supposed to show that mental procedures cannot go beyond mechanical procedures. However, this argument
is inconclusive. Okay, during these regards completely is the fact that mind in its use is
not static, but constantly developing. For example, we understand absolute terms more and more precisely
as we go on using them, and that more and more absolute terms enter the sphere of our understanding
and so on. So he gets a technical argument. And I'm not trying to say he's right or he's wrong.
They engaged with each other in a dialogue from the beginning because they understood the importance
of this question. They understood the implications for our society. And Turing was right. He said,
by the end of the century, this will become commonplace. And a lot of people will be saying this,
even if I think the question do can machines think is not a productive one. This is, this is
reality. This is going to happen. So we might as well, I might as well now lay the foundations of
this and have a framework for discussing this. What does it mean? And he goes to nine arguments,
nine arguments against it. And then the third one, the third argument is the mathematical
objection, which is Godel's incompleteness theorem. He says, he writes, there are a number of
results of mathematical logic, which can be used to show that there are limitations to the powers
of discrete state machines. The best known of these results is known as Godel's theorem,
and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical system, statements can be formulated,
which can neither be proved nor disproved within the system, unless possibly the system itself
is inconsistent and so on. And then he writes, I do not think this view can be dismissed quite so
likely. You see, he is himself not sure. And in fact, the year he died in 1954, he talked about
in his last article published 1954, you know, kind of a popular in a popular magazine,
science news. At the very end, this is 1954, just about the time he died. He says,
the results, it's called solvable and unsolvable problems. And he's arguing that,
that what what theory of computer science shows is that there are unsolvable problems,
there are things which cannot be solved by an algorithm. And this is important. I think a lot
of people have not really had the chance to think about it. To a large extent, because of atrocious
state of our education. And I feel it's imperative for somebody like me who got exposed to it.
And I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm presenting some truth which has not been known.
It's all very well known to specialists, whether they would like to turn a blind eye to it or not.
It is well known. But to most people, it is not well known. So I think that this and it's not
present in the conversation about AI, at least I don't see it that much present, you see. And this
idea that as soon as you that the computation includes within itself, the idea that things are
uncomputable, they're undecidable, unsolvable. Here's a book that, for instance, there's a whole
collection of articles here. What are the words which are used in the title? Undecidable
propositions, unsolvable problems, uncomputable functions. Can you show that book once more?
Okay, the Undecidable by Martin Davis, and that'll be in the description,
as well as the link to the two articles that you mentioned of Turing.
The limitations, the inherent limitations of computation. He grappled with this from the
beginning because he's understood the power of it, the potentiality of it. He also liked the idea
of intelligent machines. But he also understood that it's not so simple. There are serious
arguments why it's not possible. So in 1954, I have read through several papers of his
to see the evolution of his views also. He's not dogmatic. He's not like, it's like that. And then
I'm going to prove it, you know, all the power that I have while ignoring all opposite arguments,
which unfortunately we see that today. That's not his approach at all. And his last paper,
his last paper. In fact, he finishes with saying the results which have been described in this
article are mainly of a negative character, setting certain bounds to what we can hope to
achieve purely by reasoning. See, he's already expanding from computation to reasoning. He says
this and some other results of mathematical logic may be regarded as going somewhere towards a
demonstration within mathematics itself of the inadequacy of reason, quote unquote,
unsupported by common sense, inadequacy of reason, unsupported by common sense.
Are you aware of Penrose's and Lucas's argument that says that?
Of course. Oh, yes. Penrose is a fantastic book. I have it here, you know, the book on this.
And actually, there are two books about this. I love this one. You see how many bookmarks.
Yeah. Yeah. So here's something that you made me think about.
There's something called, in ancient Greece, there's something called the unity of virtues.
Have you heard of that? To some extent, I suppose, yes. Yeah. Okay. So basically it says that you
can't have one of the virtues without incorporating the rest as you increase in the virtues. You
can't be brave without being honest. True bravery requires honesty. And then true honesty requires
courage. I wish it works. I wish it was simple, but okay. Yeah. Well, anyway, they were saying that
as you have more and more of them, they unify at something like the most good,
which they would equate with God. Then you had me thinking, well, okay, look at this. We're taught
more to think algebraically and algorithmically than we are to think in the way that the Greeks
did with lines and circles. So less geometric, at least in this is my case for my education.
And then I was thinking, well, the people who are
the most playful with their ideas and creative and poetic and romantic,
they tend to be the more geometric side of the mathematician. So for instance,
Einstein, Penrose, Michael Atia. And then I was wondering, this is a huge speculative jump.
Is this in some way related to prioritizing this algorithmic symbolic syntactic manipulation
over something that's more physical and geometric? I'll give another quick example.
I never cared about, why can't you put a circle in a square? There's something like
squaring the circle or a circle outside of the square. Because I'm like, who cares,
you can just draw that. But then there's a specific set of rules with compasses and so on.
That never, I'm just trained algebraically like trains in terms of that's how I studied in school.
I wonder, and most of my generation is, maybe even your generation,
and I wonder how much of this dismissal of these grand ideas comes from a dismissal
of geometry, like picture proofs are, hey, look, if you rearrange this.
You can have, there is something to what you're saying, and there is a famous quote,
which I don't remember who said it, maybe Atia, that God is like,
influence mathematicians through geometry and devil through algebra, you know.
That's soupy. Okay, so there is some truth to it. In other words, there is more imagination
in some sense in geometry. Alignment's program, in a way, is what tries to unify discrete and
continuous and symbolic algebraic with geometric imaginative in a way. That's what I find beautiful.
Ultimately, all of these distinctions that we make, these are all distinctions in our mind.
They're all the distinctions. This is a story we tell ourselves. If I believe that there is a
boundary, there is a line between the two, this is how it is for me then.
But it's like people say truth and beauty. It's already implicit in that is that the
truth they will find, they don't expect to be beautiful. And the beauty they find,
they don't expect to be true. But you yourself made the distinction. You yourself drew the line
between the two. It doesn't have to be this way. You can say truth slash beauty, one thing,
or truth dash beauty, one thing. And then in your life, you are more likely to encounter
two things which are beautiful, and beautiful things which are true. Same with geometry,
algebra, and so on. These are all, ultimately, these are all frameworks to create. And in
modern mathematics, you cannot do one without the other. The progress is made when they
hit upon each other, when they touch each other, algebraic methods, geometric methods, and so on.
That's why we have algebraic geometry, which was created in the modern version,
was created by the genius Alexander Gross, and you could come back to that earlier.
His genius was precisely to be able to connect them, put them together, you see.
So, but there are people who are dogmatic on both sides, who are predominantly algebraic,
or predominantly geometric. I think what is essential to understand is how much we are
informed by our own psychology, how much we are informed by our own aesthetic preferences,
our philosophical preferences, our metaphysical preferences. In other words, the quandary of
subjective, objective. A friend of mine who listened to my recent interview with Alex Friedman,
Conversation with Alex Friedman, where I talked about subjective, kind of like similar to what
we discussed with subjective. He's like, well, but it's kind of troubled. I feel it's uncomfortable
with it because you're proposing to replace some objective things by subjective. That is
totally missing the point. What the point is to realize that you have always been doing this.
You have always admixed your subjective to what you believe is objective. And then you try to come
up with an argument presenting your ideas as if they're detached from you. I would content that
that's not the case, that it's always present. So it is not about replacing something with something,
it's about acknowledging that's what you have been doing all along, or what I have been doing all
along. To what extent my theories, which I like to think of as objective, are driven,
are motivated by my subjective preferences. For instance, we talked about, I like infinity.
I just like it. So it's my aesthetic preference. But if on the basis of this, I will start saying
that everybody should like it. And those people who don't accept it are stupid or misguided.
That's where I go astray. And that's where I introduce unnecessary, I put unnecessary strain
on my mathematics. And you know, it always, when somebody is really emotional about it,
they give themselves away. Because as a friend of mine once said, a very smart fellow, he said,
you know, you're not going to argue with someone who will say gravity doesn't exist.
He said, yeah, good luck. Good luck. You're not going to argue with the froze, you know,
the corners of your mouth. That's not the case. And likewise, when somebody is arguing too passionately
about something, it means that it's something there, in here, unresolved. We are not paying
attention to this. We are pretending that in science we are really driven by some objective
reality. Yes, we are to a large extent, like I said, our as a community, we decide which
actions are more fruitful and so on. But as a practice as a human being as an individual,
I'm also very much driven by things which are come from my psychology, my psychology composition,
but my philosophical preferences from my, you know, and my job is to be aware of it. That's
called self awareness. Otherwise, I'm asleep. I'm half asleep. I am not here. I'm not. And so
therefore, I am not doing my job correctly, in my opinion. So Alan Turing was aware. So here is
a good example. Alan Turing, as someone who was aware of that raises very interesting question.
He was not frustrated by it. I think it made it even more interesting for him in many ways.
It's a shame that the way he was treated by the British government, as I'm sure you know,
that he was subjected to hormonal therapy, you know, because he was gay. And he died at the age
of 32, as most people believe, by suicide. What a travesty, you know? And that's the machine,
the machine. That's the real machine that we should be aware of and careful about, you know.
What do you mean that's the machine? The machine, the government, the government power,
which is unleashed to destroy an individual, a brilliant individual. And you say, well,
it's because he's gay. No, it wasn't because he was different.
So more broadly speaking, societal norms or the government in particular?
Well, in these cases, obviously, it was a government, not government government,
but the government agents, obviously. What I mean to say is the machine in general for us,
in your mind, is it the government or is it societal norms or is it?
I don't know. I purposely, I purposely dropped this word because the machine could mean
computer or quote unquote artificial intelligence, which people are arguing about now,
whether it has the power to subjugate humans and so on. So here's a man who actually theorized
that possibility in the most advanced way possible during and he's actually destroyed by a machine
of a different kind. Interesting. I see. How interesting. I'm not, I don't, I'm not going to
spoil it by revealing the punchline. You know, let's think about this. Let's think about what
does this tell us? What does it tell us? In other words, he was so inconvenient somehow in this
cement who was instrumental in deciphering the enigma machine, you know, who has contributed
so much to the defense of the United Kingdom. And how many years passed before they finally
apologized for what they did, or at least acknowledged the government of the UK?
What does it tell us? Is this like an isolated incident? Or is this something that has been
a kind of a norm that somebody who is different, somebody who is different, no matter how much
they contributed to a given society is ostracized and ultimately destroyed. So
how do you not get destroyed from thinking about, well, okay, you mentioned self-awareness.
Self-awareness. So he is a man who was self-aware, you see, and that's why I would like to, I would
like to emphasize this point and I would like more people to pay attention and say Alan Turing
could do that. Can I, can I also look in a kind of, what's the word, a neutral kind of way on the
things without emotional investment in it, but on, look at the facts, way different ideas,
different opinions without being engaging in at home in attacks or, you know, like,
getting overly emotional about it. Can I, and if not, and if I can't, let's find out why. Let's
find out what is really, what within me is creating trouble, so to speak. And it's not a
bad thing. It's not a bad thing. Is there something that's bad about being emotional about it? Because
you're clearly passionate about what you're saying, but I wouldn't say that what you said is wrong
because it means you're emotional. So yes, but it's important for me to know where it comes from.
Like, you did ask me this and I will, I can explain briefly, but yes, I'm not arguing that there
shouldn't be passion. Of course, this is this, that is an engine of progress. But the question is,
your passion comes from something you're aware of, or something in your unconscious.
Okay. You see? And that is essential. Because if I'm, if I'm not aware of what is actually driving me,
chances are I'm not actually going to be effective, even if I'm proposing good ideas and so on. Because
there's too much spurious stuff at mixed, which are on me, which I can resolve within me. I don't
need Albert Einstein to resolve it for me or Alan Turing. I can resolve it myself if I'm interested.
You see? Yeah, specifically speaking, how did you come to this? How do you realize,
I have to be careful about how did I get interested in this subject?
More like, let's say you have predilections or flaws or pros and cons, but they're unconscious.
And then to go back to this onion metaphor, that's right, there's a finite layer, but you can
start to peel away the layers. What is this process of peeling for you? Is it I go to therapy?
Is it I read a certain amount of books and I ask myself, is it I meditate? The process is
different for everyone. Yes, there isn't one. I believe there's no one formula. Actually,
all the methods you Yeah, it's useful to hear the stories from people who have gone through.
Absolutely. I think that we absolutely the way the best way that we can address this is by actually
sharing our stories and not trying to say it should be done this way or that way. Yeah, but
this is was the first step. You see, this is what led me to the process of self inquiry.
So I already mentioned how it led me to questioning, for instance, why am I doing
mathematics? Am I doing it because I love it? Or am I doing it because I want to achieve recognition
and awards and so on? That's what was one of the things came out of it. But the much bigger thing
that came out of it is the whole idea of self inquiry, the whole idea that there are some things
which are not aware of the question. Who am I? I thought I heard this question before. I knew
that it was inscribed on the Apollo, the Apollo temple in Delphi, but I didn't understand what
it meant. Who am I? I am Edward Frankel. I am a Berkeley professor. It's a dangerous question.
It's a very dangerous question when you're actually engaged with it, for real.
Yeah, it's a terrifying question. And we can't do it on our own, I think. Ultimately,
it has to be somebody in your life. So it could be a therapist, for instance. In my case, I was
lucky. There was some human being who just came into my world who was a wise woman. Let's just say
wise woman. And somebody I respected who, and this is about a year after the book came out.
So this is the summer of 2014. The book was published in October 2013. So I was ready to go
beyond Edward 1.0 to Edward 2.0. You have to be ready for it in some sense. And then the universe
quote unquote will conspire. At least that's what happened to me. And I have seen heard stories,
similar stories from other people. So what happened was that she basically started talking
about life and so on. And I was very curious about reality. What is reality? Because I was
obsessed with the idea that where mathematics comes from. It was very clear to me, it doesn't come
from human minds, specific human minds. Like Pythagoras did not create Pythagoras theorem,
you know? Or if I was Gallo, I did not create Gallo groups. They were there for him to discover.
But then what does it mean? What is reality then? What is it at the base of reality?
And in fact, if you look, and the title of my book is Love and Math, and the subtitle is the
heart of hidden reality. So it's kind of like my search for hidden reality was happening,
even if I was not fully aware of what I'm doing, even when I was writing.
And then the crucial thing that she told me, she said, yes, Edward, there is hidden reality,
quote unquote. But it's not outside. You think that you find it somewhere. In fact,
it's within you. You have to learn more about yourself. And so, and I said, what does it mean?
So then she told me some stories of what it means, what it meant in her case that she was able to
be connected to some childhood experiences that she had, when she was an adult already.
And that completely changed her view, her outlook. And suddenly things start happening. I
started remembering things that happened to me as a child. In particular, the experience that I
described in the book in chapter three, about my exam when I was 16 years old, and I was failed
at the exam at Moscow University. I thought I knew, I remembered it. I remembered it factually.
I remembered it as a third person from a third person perspective. But I did not remember it
from the first person. And so then suddenly this happened in September of 2014, where I was asked
to speak about it. And the night before, at my hotel, I was able to connect with that boy.
And it was like a tsunami. I realized what happened. Did you break down crying? Oh, of course.
But it was worse because in some sense, it was worse because the thought that I had in my mind
was no amount of tears justify this world, justify this life. Why? What is the point? Oh,
it's a really, really kind of sad moment because you realize that part of you died. I
realized part of me died when I was 16 years old, and I was not even aware of it for 30 years.
So I am moving with a battlefield of life, crippled, basically, like I'm missing a limb,
and I'm not even aware of it. And my mind, my conscious mind, don't look there, don't look
there, don't look there. That's why I was coming up with all of these ideas about the universe and
reality, the objective reality and so on. Because how convenient? It's all deterministic,
and it's all a bag of particles. So particles don't feel pain or a human is an algorithm.
So it's a coping mechanism.
Coping mechanism. For me, for me, it definitely was. And I will never say that that's true for
everybody. Maybe it is for some people, maybe it's not. All I'm doing, I'm sharing my story.
This is my story. I am convinced that some of the naive and vapid, quite frankly,
ideas that I entertained about the world were, to a large extent, motivated by me not willing
to find out what happened to me when I was 16 years old. Because it was too painful.
Because it was too painful. I wrote a piece about this, by the way. I was asked to,
I've spoken about this a number of times, including my last conversation with Lex Whitman.
But I also wrote a short piece for a volume by my friend who is an expert,
Jim Polsky, who is an expert on AI safety. So he published a volume.
Oh, thank you for the description.
Yeah. Academic volume on AI safety and security. And he asked me to contribute
about first person perspective. So I wrote about this and what extent this defined me,
not knowing, not knowing, because then your life becomes driven to a large extent by creating
barriers of finding out. And that's what it means who you are, who am I, right? So I understood
what it means. If there is this part of me, which I chopped off, why? Because it was too painful.
So it is a defense mechanism. Nothing wrong with it. It all happens to all of us, I believe,
to some extent. And there is a lot of literature about this, by the way, and neuroscience
confirmations and so on. But it's me. It's part of me. And yet I'm no longer connected to it.
So do I know who I am? No, because there is this part of me, which I'm not connected to.
So that's one way in which you can become a very practical question. Who am I? Am I aware of all my
secret little adverts? And not necessarily, it could happen in adolescence and in adult life.
Most traumatic experiences, most difficult experiences usually happen when the children
were not yet equipped to deal with this pain. And for me, it defined my life. It gave me a lot
of fuel, it propelled me to become a mathematician and so to achieve and so on. To prove those guys
who failed me that how good I am, you see. So five years after I failed at 16, I got a letter
from the president of Harvard University inviting me to come to Harvard as a visiting professor.
I'm barely 21 because I wrote some papers, which became famous or well-known, you know?
Why? Because the drive, you know, but then the cost of it, the downside of it is that I'm not,
I lose that spontaneity, spontaneity of a child, that ability to look at the world with
fresh eyes. I'm afraid of things. I'm scared. I want control. I want safety.
Do you feel like that was a cost that if you were able to rewind time, you wouldn't pay?
Because another perspective is, you know what, Edward? Everything that happened to you made you.
I did it myself, of course. Of course. I would not change a thing. But I can say it only now
because I have connected to that child. I connected to some other painful experiences
that I can say it. If somebody came to me before it happened and told me that Edward,
you should be grateful to your examiners who failed you because that's what made you who you are.
I would just hit them in the face. Like, what are you talking about? How dare you? But now,
of course, I know. Yes, of course. I would not change a thing. It was all me, all along.
And I am not no qualms about it. I would not have been who I am without any of those experiences.
Unless I still refuse to connect to them. If I'm still refusing, then I'm not myself fully.
You see what I mean? And so you ask, how did I get interested in this subject? So then,
this is 2014. Then I started getting invited to various forums to speak about this thing.
And that's when there was the first wave when AI became controversial. This is
mind you, nine years ago. But already you had people like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk and
Bill Gates already voiced concerns. And so this becomes my playground, this conversation, because
I think up until that point, I am in sort of this half asleep state where I am still thinking
partially about myself as a kind of a machine. I would like to be a machine because the machine
doesn't feel pain. So, you know, kind of feel safe. Also, I feel that I know how things work.
Again, it makes me feel in control, you know. Suddenly, all of that is swept away.
My child, my inner child, you know, such it becomes such a trope. I don't want to use this
expression, but it's true. It's like you gain this dimension, this dimension of a,
you know, you talked about this archetype of divine child. That's the part of you which always wants
to grow, which wants to look at the world with fresh eyes, which is spontaneous, which is
spontaneous, which is playful. I lost it to a large extent because my connection to a very
specific child, 16-year-old Edward, was severed, severed, you know, at that exam. And suddenly,
I'm connected. So that now I am like, wow, you know, so now I am going the opposite extreme.
And I'm saying, you know, this, so then for me, AI becomes this idea of AI, the ideas of
uploading, like that singularity and uploading your mind and so on. It becomes totally opposite
to what I'm experiencing, right? It almost becomes the idea of me being captured by this,
again, by the, by my cerebral side. Because ultimately for me, this discussion about AI,
it's just a safe way to talk about ourselves. AI represents our, our cerebral logical side,
like in the movie, the 2001 space Odyssey by, by the great Stanley Kubrick,
Carl 9000. What is Carl 9000? He is that the cerebral part of Dave Bowman, the astronaut,
which has run amok. I know a few familiar with this movie. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So that becomes the
motivation for this, for this, for this interest, you see. And so ultimately, I understand also that
we need to find balance because of course, this is amazing technological innovations.
And there's nothing wrong with them. As long as we put phrase the phrase our inquiry, our questions
properly, not as a question of, as already I said, it's not a good way, are they thinking,
are they conscious, are they intelligent? The question is to what extent they help,
they are here to facilitate, to help me to be as good a network as I can be. It's like, it's like
artists in the end of 19th, the beginning of 20th century after photography was discovered.
So suddenly, you don't need to be, being an artist is not about rendering things realistically,
because a camera can do it better than you. So what do you do? Did artists say, it's over for us?
We become the captives, the slaves of the, of the photo camera. No, they discover other ways
to express themselves. That's how you get impressionism, abstract art, cubism, you know,
surrealism and so on, where the focus is more on the inner experience of the viewer and the artist,
you see. They accepted the challenge and it propelled them to the next level.
And likewise for us, I think it's very clear that
charge gpt is showing us that some of the things that perhaps we thought were creative,
they're not that, they're not that creative. The computer program, which is basically trained
on just correlations of things in various texts throughout the internet, can actually reproduce
it and maybe do a better job than you do. So I think it is a challenge. What am I bringing to
the table? If this computer program can replace these things. So what, what can I, what can I do
that it cannot do? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So there's something called the moving of the goalpost
fallacy, which I don't see as always a fallacy. So for instance, you just mentioned, we thought
that creativity was the ability to draw accurately, let's say in the early 90s. That's right. Then
we realized, okay, something else can do that. So we changed what creative means. But it's not
because in the one sense, you can say we've moved the goalpost, but it's not a fallacy,
because our original definition reflects our ignorance. We realize something.
Because we can grow. That's the whole point. Everybody, especially I love it when it comes
from people who are actually completely sold on evolution, they say it's only, it's the only
force in development of say human beings or other species. You may agree or disagree with it. And
some people say that maybe there are some other things that have to be taken account. I'm not
going to make a judgment. But I'm just curious, what do you think evolution is for human beings?
If it's not, this is a very good example, how we can evolve is because we are challenged by the
technology that we ourselves create. Now, this is a very different framework, a very different
mindset that the mindset of the sort of end of the world and how these things are going to capture
us and kill us and so on. It's not productive, obviously, but this challenge, take it as a challenge,
how you respond to it. I think it's very productive. And a lot of people are, I'm not saying something
original. I've heard a lot of people say that. It's just that it's not necessarily represented
in the debate that you could see in the media, because usually it's computer scientists who
are being questioned. And let me tell you, if somebody asked me 10 years ago, before I had my,
I have to say, before I started to ask the question, who am I? I would give you an answer.
I would have given you an answer. Yeah, very, very confidently, you know.
And maybe that's another sign that you should trust someone is how assertive and
how little self-doubt do they show. I want to be personal, if you don't mind, and reveal
something to you. Maybe this will go and maybe it won't. When you mentioned, look, you had some
childhood issues. I've always heard this like childhood issues, childhood issues, and I've
explored my childhood. I can't find issues. But then I realized, okay, well, you said 16.
So I think I had, well, when I was 17, I had my heart so broken. Like, I don't think it's been
broken as much since like ever. And, and man, with this podcast, Edward, like almost with
everything I do, I struggle like so hard, I struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle,
I push, and this, there's this ambition, competitiveness, and
there's a desire in me. It has to be the best. It has to be undeniably the best. Like when I
interview someone, it has to be that someone could watch all the interviews of that person say,
this whole theories of everything was the deepest with this person. And luckily,
luckily, often I'll get the interviewees saying something like this, these sort of insightful
questions I've never been asked this or whatever. Okay, so I get some validation, or from the
commenters. But, but so I'd often think, you know what, I don't have childhood issues. I have adult
issues, meaning that like, I have this distinct feeling that 10 years from now, I'll look at myself
now and want to hug him, like just say, Hey, man, like you, I'm sorry, like I'm broken now.
But I also think that much of that comes from crippling feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy
from when I was 17. Sure. Sure, exactly. Right. Exactly. Right. And then the thing is,
in what you say is, I resonate completely. But one thing one has to be very careful of saying,
there was no issue over it. It's our thinking mind who says that I'm thinking my is very limited.
So you, one of the main ideas that he brought sort of out and became
part of our collective discourse is the idea of unconscious.
Freud talked about subconscious, I prefer unconscious. So this idea that there are some
realms of the psyche which are not accessible to the thinking mind yet.
And it's very important to accept that, I think, because then it's not anymore that those thinking
mind is the final arbiter of what did or did not happen. In my case, if you ask me in 2014, before
I had my sort of experience of reconnection, are you connected to that boy that was suffered in
in 1984 in this exam, I would say yes, of course, because I remember every fact of it. And in fact,
I wrote it. I wrote the story in my book, which was published a year before. Interestingly enough,
a lot of people were inspired by it. And a lot of people came or wrote to me or talked to me
about it. They were touched by it. And I was surprised because I was not yet touched by it.
But because that's the power of art. Because I wanted to write a book and to connect
to my readers. I allowed the boy to speak. I was not yet ready to speak to the boy.
Me, adult Edward in 2013 or 2012. But because I wanted the book to be real,
I delegated this chapter to him. And it was the first time that he was unfiltered. He spoke. Not
to me yet. He spoke to the readers of the book, but the ice was broken. So barely a year later,
I finally found the courage and the strength to speak to him directly and to understand,
to remember what happened. So my thinking mind was not aware of it. It's very important to understand.
And it cannot force it. It's very important not to force because if you're not ready for it,
I could commit suicide easily, easily. I could see that easily because you're so disenchanted.
You're so disappointed in this cruel, cruel world. You feel like there is no reason to live.
And you have to be very strong to withstand that. And in fact, the point is that it passes.
It passed. And I had this amazing experience of like, he comes alive. He's within me. Like,
I hold him. He's here. And I spoke to him to the little Edward. And I said, look,
you know, I'm sorry, I have neglected you for three years. I did not know.
But look what we have done. Look what we have done. It was not in vain. It was not in vain. And
now you're back and I will never let anybody hurt you. And what did the little boy say in response?
It was just beaming, you know. And the next day, so I was invited to speak at this
spoken word kind of event in New York in 2014. There is actually audio on my website. It's called
a test. And I spoke and the boy spoke and it was like, I never experienced that kind of connection
with the audience. It was the first time he actually spoke through the microphone into the
audience because he was with me. I let him speak. So the point I was trying to make is that when
we are ready, if we are sincere, if we are not actively trying to prevent this type of experience,
it will happen. Don't try to force it. But always ask when something is off, like when you feel,
get agitated, for me, it's like this, it'll get agitated unnecessarily triggered. What is the
source? When was the first time I experienced that? Under what circumstances? So that kind of gives
a path to finding out the source. Because usually some kind of event, I think oftentimes,
it could be a series of things. It may not be just a single event, I suppose. But most powerful
are events like you said when we get broken. And it doesn't have to be child. It could be adolescent,
teenager. It could even be a young adult. But an experience as a young adult,
once you process it, it may lead you to an experience as a teenager and which can lead you
to an experience when you were six years old or something. And there is nothing wrong. Ultimately,
it becomes this beautiful journey of self-discovery. It's beautiful because it's you. You learn more
about yourself. People go, you know, like Columbus, he has to get on the ship and try to find India,
then he doesn't find India, he finds America and so on. Here, it's you. You're here. You cannot
run away from yourself anyway. And it becomes this beautiful process of self-discovery. And each time
a new layer is left, you start for me. It's been like this. I start seeing things which I couldn't
see before. And I'm pretty sure it influenced my mathematics also. Did you feel like a weight was
lifted and you're actually even physically more flexible? Oh, of course. Oh, it's on the level
of body. It's an incredible restructuring. Which, by the way, is another way. So there is yoga,
there's meditation, all kinds of things which are also meant to reconnect us to these other
dimensions. The problem is for somebody like me is in the mind. I'm in the mind. I'm in the mind,
in the mind meaning like the cerebral logical stuff. And I become a prisoner of it. That I try to
apply. That becomes my only tool. So if I'm confused, if I'm not sure, it used to mean,
for me, think about it harder. Think about it more. That's the only way through logic, through
reason and so on. William James said that that's like trying to see more of the darkness by turning
up the gas. Yeah, or it's like trying to find darkness with the lamp at night. Just where is
it? Where is it? Or trying to find the white snow when you have orange glasses. Where is the white?
Where is the white? Let me put on more glasses, more glasses. More yellow, more yellow. I mean,
it's very clear. So the thing is, and then going back to your earlier question, if you asked me
10 years ago about AI and all this stuff, before all this experience. So of course, I'll give you
a particular answer because I actually chose mathematics as a way to escape from reality,
because reality was too cruel for me. I didn't want to deal with this stuff. So I found this,
what I consider to be a pure world of plateauing forms, where there was no bigotry. There was
nobody to hurt me, where I could just revel in the beauty of it. And don't bother me with your
so-called wicked world, you know? So then how can you trust me? So some people, then people would
come, if they came to me, and they, because they look up to me as a scientist, as a mathematician,
so they have some expertise that they don't have, they would trust me to give them a kind of a wise
answer. But I was not capable of giving a wise answer by virtue of my psychological composition.
Isn't it obvious? If I have not done any work of self-discovery, of finding out who I am,
of reconnecting to the parts of myself that were lost on the battlefield of life, so to speak,
how can I possibly give a good answer? But people don't realize because they think of us as our
their gurus, you know? And because they don't have, because our education system is broken.
And also the popular book sometimes suggests things which are like, I go like, whoa,
this is 19th century science, which has been thoroughly repudiated by 20th century,
but as Matthew Phillips. So that's where we are. But I think, luckily, because you have your
podcast and others, and I think that it starts moving, it starts moving, finally,
in the right direction. And the right direction is understanding that our personality,
our first person perspective is intricately connected, is intertwined with our series.
They do not exist on their own. And we are not independent spectators and observers.
We are in the thick of it.
With you forgiving your examiners, did you have to, well, okay, firstly, do you still feel like
you're able to forgive them or is there a part of you that-
Absolutely. They suffered. I know one of them actually, it came to my attention that one of them,
around the same time when I was reconnecting in 2014, he died in a, he was a kind of a,
he liked to go on hiking trips like in North of Russia alone, and that they found his body and he
died in one of those trips in 2014. And the other one, I don't know, the other guy, I don't know.
But I absolutely believe that they suffered. They must have suffered. I mean, how do you feel
by if you do this to a young kid who's done nothing wrong, right? So it's just because of my Jewish
name, last name, my dad is Jewish. So Frank is a Jewish name. My mom's Russian, by the way,
you know, by blood, you know, and not religious at all and so on. And then yet you single out
somebody like that and then they give this, you give this hard questions. It's a setup.
Right. So this is well documented. I'm trying to say, I see that they must have suffered.
I see that they were misguided. And so that's number one. And number two, also, you know,
thank you for giving me all this fuel. Without which, I mean, if I was accepted to Moscow University,
oh boy, I would be living in a dorm. Okay. Yeah, probably party like there is no tomorrow.
Would I become a good mathematician? I'm not sure. Which okay, would still be an interesting life.
But this definitely shaped my life in a particular way and brought me to places which I may not have
been able to reach otherwise. So in some sense, yes, thank you. It sounds weird. But it's only
because my boy is here and he's not going to let me fly. You know, it's not going to say he's
laughing with me. It's like, yeah. That's the paradox. That's that. That's how that's the
transformation of life. That is evolution and growth from somebody who's not willing to look
that pain in the eye, so to speak, you know, face that reality. And therefore, is bound to run away
from certain experiences in life or from certain insights or from certain ways of understanding
life to someone who becomes friends with that through suffering, of course, through suffering,
you cannot avoid it in my opinion. And by the way, you know, it's not I listen to is a great
conversation in Lex Friedman and Yuval Harari, you know, that he wrote to sapiens and a great
historian and writer. And he's something he said a bunch of things which I really really
resonate with me is suffering is a human. So this is what distinguishes that from robots
ultimately. So in other words, during had this imitation game, where you have a conversation
with an interrogator, and the robot is trying to convince the interrogator that it is human.
But in fact, the real criterion is can it suffer? Because that is, I would say,
unavoidable and essential part of human life. You know, and so running away from it limits us
being able to process it liberates us. That's my view. Okay, again, I prefaced it by saying
that's been true for me. It may not be the case for everyone else. I don't know. I have no way
of knowing. I do have anecdotal evidence that it works for other people in this way, too,
but I cannot be sure. Is your forgiveness of your examiners predicated on them suffering?
So that is to say, if you thought that they didn't suffer, would you still forgive them?
I don't know. Good question. Good question. I mean, like I said, there are two aspects of it.
First of all, me recognizing that they may have suffered themselves. And second, my gratitude.
For setting up for participating in this experience, which gave me so much fuel that
it launched me into the stratosphere. So they were participants in this, maybe motivated by
something abhorrent, you know, and terrible. But the fact of the matter is they played their
role very well. You're making me realize something, which is that I, so again, I don't know how much
of this I'll keep in. But for myself, with when I was 17, I would say that, oh, no, no, no, I forgive
this person, because I'm the wretched, sordid, despicable person who looks at other people who
are successful. And I'm like, I have no mentor. When I went to university, I had depression for
seven years. So I skipped classes. I didn't have a peer group. And I would look at people who are
successful and be like, yeah, well, that's because you had advantages and I didn't. So in a sense,
it's like a prisoner with a door locked from the inside. And I say all of this with some, well,
with a large amount of saltiness and, and just because I'm trying to be blunt, but also because
I'm overcompensating for my urge to sugarcoat it. And I just lost years of my life. And so I would
point the finger at myself. And I think part of the problem is, is that some of what was done to me,
let's just put that in quotations, was not okay. But I'm not able to say that because I have to
point the finger to myself. But then subconsciously, I'm still pointing the finger at someone else.
And that's okay. Don't, don't force it. That's my advice. In other words, don't forgive prematurely
because then it means a short, you're trying to short circuit something. That's my view.
There may, there may well be something for you to discover in this, in this memory, in this memory.
Don't try to do it fast. What's the point of, you know, it's like Alan Woods said, you know,
when you play music, it's the purpose is not to get to the end of the piece. Because if that were
the case, then the fastest musicians would be the best. No, it's the point is to play. And so
just be open, maybe be, be open to the idea that there is more to discover.
Speaking of paradoxes, Edward, like, look at this, man, like, I get to speak with you. Like,
look at what you do. Like, you get to study math, even though you're saying like, well,
initially was an escape route. Like, I, I have the, I have a beautiful, I have the best life,
the best wife, the best, I love my car, even though it's just a Toyota. Like, I love every
aspect of my life and more and more and more. And interestingly, despite the suffering, perhaps
because of the suffering, like, Hey, who knows? Yeah, that, that the struggle, sorry, not suffering.
I don't, I don't, I don't suffer. Sure, whatever, whatever. Yeah. More and more have been biking
recently, Edward. So, and I, there's this new feeling, a new feeling. I don't know how to describe
it other than when I look out at the world, it's like a, it's like the feeling when you're
extremely thirsty and then you take a gulp, but it's of satisfaction and beauty. Something like
being transfixed by the splendor of the world or amazement, something I look out, I'm like,
Whoa, and I haven't seen that for my entire life, except for the past few months, like more and
more and more. And I don't know where I was going with that now, but what I'm saying is that
despite all of this talk, like the of, of, of working super, super hard, working hard, like
understanding different physical theories and dealing with consciousness theories, like that's
rattling. And at the same time, juggling, editing, family obligations, so on. So
like, this is what an honor that I get to speak with you. Like, holy moly, you're like for years,
I actually, I didn't, I remember recognizing your face and you've influenced me years ago
and I'd forgotten. And now I get to speak with you. Now I get to read your book and speak with
the author. Like, what a beautiful privilege. Like it's the best is the best man and say,
I'm sure you're like, holy moly, what? No, I get to speak with Kurt. Wow. No, I'm just kidding.
But I get, I get to study the Langlands program. I get to make contributions that stay in math.
Man, what lives? Yeah, well, but this, it's beautiful. It is beautiful. Edward. Okay,
one last thing. And now I feel guilty because this is something that comes up is that whenever
I have this feeling of, wow, look how great life is. Then I think, yeah, but most other people,
or at least in my mind, most other people and many other people are suffering. Who am I to
feel so good? And then that impinges and it prevents me from fully appreciating a moment
because I'm like, yeah, but there are people who are starving. Yeah, but there are people
who can't make ends meet. And yeah, but there are people who so and so and so. So how do you
ever struggle with that? And how do you deal with that? No, of course, but I don't know. I feel that
we cannot do, but we have a life a human being has limited resources, we have limited life,
you know, like in terms of the longevity, you know, how many years we got, we have limited
spatial dimensions and so on, and resources energy. So the question is not to spread ourselves in.
And that's why I'm not so, I'm not so happy when people go on Twitter and they start
venting their anger, because it's actually, it means run away from your two responsibilities.
It's cheap to go and accuse and blame on people. It's an emotional discharge. But what are you,
so if you really care about this, just go to that war zone, go to that poor country and so on,
and do it, do action is not the same as war, as war, which are not supported by action. So,
so then what's the, what's the, how to resolve? What's the resolution of this resolution is to
find what you truly love and dedicate yourself to it a hundred percent. And this way you will
contribute in a positive way to the society. And then your own, you know, self recriminations and
thoughts about you deserve, don't deserve and so on is, is you're blocking yourself from building,
fully dedicating and really impacting things. It takes energy away. That's how I see it.
That's like self doubt. It's natural. I'm not, I'm not saying it's not, it's, well, I'm, I'm given to
sometimes about self doubt and self criticism and so on. It's normal, I think. But ideally,
ideally, I would like, I consider it as something that is a waste. And the way to, to overcome it
is to truly do what you love and, and just keep going with it and look, you know, how successful
your podcast is, for instance, you know, it's only been around a couple of years. You have so many
some people, such a dedicated audience and really great interviews, you know, I've watched a bunch
of them. So that's how that's what we can do when we really dedicate ourselves to something that we
truly love. And I think that's the, that's the only way we can do it. So what else can we do?
Be aware of yourself, be aware also of the world, be aware of the suffering in the world,
but also be aware that you cannot go, you cannot pretend that you are the almighty God who is
going to solve everything for everybody in it. No, that's not how we set up. You have your mission.
It's not, also, it's not like a mission, which is written, which is given by somebody. I feel
like it's, it happens as we go, you choose it as your life. It's part of life. But if you're open,
you don't believe it's co-created, like there's a part that's innate, and there's a part that you
choose. It's a narrative. So maybe who knows, I feel like all of this, what you described, any
such theory is a theory, is a story that we tell ourselves. And we are human, a very important,
essential part of being human is the ability to tell stories to each other and to ourselves.
By the way, this is where I love Yuval Harari also. He explains very clearly that history of our
civilization is the history of ideas and stories, mostly stories, not even ideas, stories. We tell
each other stories and they create the sort of market of stories and they evolve and they merge
and they separate. And who knows how it happens. But we also tell ourselves stories. Now, if this
story, stories are different. So if it's, if it's helping me to be the best I can be, and this is
something which we can feel, right? Am I on the right path? Am I not on the right path? Kind of,
it kind of like a general sense. Then, okay, go along with the story, be open to changing the
story at some point when it becomes more of a hindrance than something that propels you, you
know? So what you described is a very reasonable way to think about things. And I've tried many
other ways to approach and conceptualize. And my feeling today is that
sometimes I need it, sometimes I don't, sometimes I just feel, you know, sometimes I'm guided by
something like you described, that there is this higher self and lower self and this collaboration
between the two or something. Sometimes I feel that I don't need it and it changes kind of.
But what's important is not to say it's like that and that's it. That's what we think of everything.
Right, right. Death is love exposed. That's a quotation from a wise man. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Do you
know who said this? You said this on the Let's Readman podcast. Something similar, yes. Yeah,
death is love at its barest or at its most exposed, its most wrong.
When you, yes, when you're faced with death, this is when you face an unfiltered love.
Yeah, explain that, explain that, please.
Well, I feel like, you know, death is something that does not accept any
spurious stuff. For instance, I specifically talked about my experience when my father died
four and a half years ago and we were very close and I was devastated by it. And I tried,
I was kind of immature enough, so to speak, to ask myself to say, just live through it and
observe and observe what is happening, what is happening here. So I was able to see these things,
which maybe if I was just completely overwhelmed by grief, I wouldn't be able to see. And what I saw
was that there was a natural tendency to come up with some explanation of what's going on.
Like we just discussed, you know, the story, some story, but they could not hold those stories.
Like they melted in the face of death. Like death is staring at you. And any stories you throw at it
to protect yourself. So then what is it then? And then why do I feel so much pain? And then I
realized that the intensity is simply my realization that my, you know, my father, well, you could say
my father's gone, I will not be able to spend time with him and to laugh together and to enjoy
things together. But also why does it bother me so much? Because I love him. So the root of it is love.
And then I thought the reason why it is so painful is because normally we put filters because we
pretend that it's for different beings communicating with each other. But ultimately,
when you're in love, and I strongly believe in this, you cannot love another. You always love
when it is true love in this moment of experiencing it, you become one.
It could be your father, your parent, it could be your friend, it could be your lover, your partner,
you know. But and this is a kind of cornerstone of the Eastern tradition for me, this idea of oneness.
And it sounds, it's has been perverted obviously by New Age and stuff. And all this kind of when
becomes makes it a bit facile, you know, the two facetious, you know, but the corner, the core of
idea, the core idea is precisely that in my interpretation is that the moment of love is
the moment when a separate being seizes to exist when the boundary melts. Whether we
conceptualize it this way or not, it doesn't matter, we feel it. We feel this very strong
emotion. It's a particular way of conceptualizing it, of course. But I think it's a helpful one,
because ultimately, it points out to another way of cognition, which is not tainted by the
sense of a separate being, which is to me the root of a lot of suffering is the idea that there is a
separate being actually. I can always argue to what extent it's real and to what extent is the
construct. Obviously, it's a very useful concept since I'm using it, you know, but it's important
to know that there are other ways of experiencing life. And love to me is what points to it, what
points to the ability to experience life without the burden of an idea of there being a separate
individual who is experiencing it, but something bigger, something bigger than that. And so death
is one experience where one is forced. If indeed who died is somebody you deeply love,
for real, I think that it's experience that comes to the fore. It's a sense of love so intense
that it feels like pain. Well, Professor, I have so many questions on
algebraic varieties and L functions and automorphic sheaves. But this was an unexpected turn. And
I hope to speak with you again. I appreciate you spending so much time with me.
That's my pleasure. Well, we talk, I just want to comment on this.
Yeah, well, speaking of not architecting prior to engaging like the union conception of what true
art is versus constructing the CN tower beforehand, the other option is you just like watch the
diffusion of an ink drop and bone would call that the unfoldment and you just go where it flows.
Yeah, that's what it felt. And it's good that we can do it because I think that most interesting
things in some sense are the surprise of things which are not really preset or kind of like
premeditated, but the things which arise spontaneously kind of. And so that's why I
really enjoyed the tool. So I had a question from Richard Bortchard to you. Okay. Yeah, his
question was what role do function fields play in higher dimensional algebraic varieties in the
Languines program? So we may as well just touch on a couple math questions. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
So well, Richard Bortchard was my colleague at UC Berkeley. It's a very brilliant mathematician.
He won the fields medal, but also, you know, apart from that, he's really did some groundbreaking,
really, really amazing work on he was the first one to formalize the concept of a vertex algebra,
which has actually been a staple in my research. And he proved the moonshine conjecture and so on.
And he's a very nice human being as well. So I'm kind of pleased to have a question from him.
The what he's asking about is the following. So we just got talked a little bit about the
language program. So the language program original formulation is for number fields,
for numbers, of course, numerical systems like real complex and so on. That's right. But on the
other side of it is human surfaces, which are like sphere or surface of a donut and so on.
And so under a way in his Rosetta stone that we discussed, he found a bridge between the two,
which is very similar. On one side, you have this numerical systems. On the other side, you have
this geometry of surfaces. And the bridge that he found is the following.
You should look at instead of looking at the surface itself, you look at functions on it.
And these functions are, they're going to be called metamorphic functions or rational functions that
they have zeros and poles that sometimes at some points are not defined to go to infinity.
And this, this gives you what's called a function field of the human surface
from which you can basically recover it. And that field is very much like number field,
like rational numbers. But what stands in between is when you take a,
so human surfaces as a curve from the point of view of the bridge and trace a curve over
complex numbers. But you can also, so it's defined by some equations with complex coefficient,
really normal equations with complex coefficient, coefficients in the field of complex numbers.
But you can also write such equations with coefficients in other numerical systems,
for example, in finite fields. So modular prime, modular prime, like a clock arithmetic
modular prime numbers. And then it really become that the function field of that is really very
much like, like rational numbers or a field of rational numbers. And so this way you found the
bridge between the two. So that's what it is referred to as a function field case. But in
the Landlens program, it's about curves. So it's one dimensional geometric objects. And what Richard
is asking, what about two dimensional? Now, a human surface ostensibly is two dimensional
from the point of view as a real manifold, right? So a sphere has has a longitude and
altitude, no, longitude and latitude, right, took two coordinates. So it has this dimension,
it's real dimension is two, but it's complex dimension, because I remember complex numbers
are two dimensional over the real numbers, because there is square root of negative one,
that is an independent element. So complex numbers are two dimensional over from the
perspective of real numbers. Therefore, two dimensional serve real thing is one dimensional
from the perspective of complex numbers. So as a as a complex geometric shape, it's one dimensional.
So the question is, can you extend the ideas of the Landlens program to two dimensional objects
or three dimensional and so on. And unfortunately, today, with the very few, there is very little
information about this, very scant. So there's a few examples where some analog exists.
But by and large, we don't have a picture. So the answer is in the negative right now.
But the hope is that eventually we will be just much more complex, I guess.
You know, you had a chapter in your book called The Delicate Dance. I think it's Chapter 16.
Doesn't matter. The point is that in it, you had a film script. You spoke about you and Drinfeld.
Yes, right. Yeah. Why did you choose to frame it like that?
Well, because I have been a cinema aficionado, you know, a film lover for many years. I also
co-directed Star in a short film, which gave me a lot of trouble.
Yeah, co-directed and Star. Co-directed, co-rolled and starred in it. It's called the rights of love
in math, writes like R-I-T-E-S. And also I wrote a script. I actually wrote a script for a feature
film with my friend and mentor, Thomas Farber, who's a writer and teaches literature, creative
writing at UC Berkeley. So we wrote a script called The Two-Body Problem about a writer and a
mathematician who meet in the South of France. And they talk about their love affairs,
how it's broken and so on, and how to become, how to be better humans. So I, for instance, I had a
software, I had a script writing software already. And I thought that it's always good to put it in a
kind of artistic framework. Since my job was to shake people's understanding of what mathematics
is like. So for instance, there are these boring people talking to each other about some boring
stuff. So I want to make it come more alive. So I was suggesting, imagine it as a,
as a, as a movie, as a Netflix series. Which by the way, you know, this thought came to me
because I watched your, on your channel, on your podcast, you had a conversation, a debate
between two very brilliant people, Sabine, Sabine Haasenfelder.
Sabine Haasenfelder. Haasenfelder and Bernardo Castro. I've never met Sabine in person, but
I followed her a little bit. And Bernardo, I have actually met. And they argued about
super determination. And to me, I watched it like a, like a, like a great Netflix
series, episode of a Netflix series. It was like the impact in terms of like, there's so many
subtleties there. There's so many layers. And they are such, I could do, we could do a whole
conversation of me like trying to unpack that. But I'm just trying to say I am lucky to have
the expertise to follow the discussion and to actually have my own opinions and so on.
But also to absorb the psychology. So to me, it was a case study in what we discussed earlier,
how much our preferences, like psychological, metaphysical, philosophical, how much they are,
how intricate, how intertwined they are with our theories, supposedly abstract theories of supposedly
objective reality, how much we are driven and passionate about certain ideas. It was a case
study for both of them, actually. And they were, because they were so sincere about it.
Interesting. You felt both were staunch in their opinion. Sorry, for the people who are watching,
the link to that will be in the description and it's the debate between Bernardo Castro and Sabine
Hossenfeld. They're called the new theory or new super determinism, something like that.
It'll be in the description. It's fascinating because, you know,
I don't know, I just want to say it's such an it actually brought me to read some stuff about it.
So in this case, the way I see it is that Sabine is very adamant about the particular idea that
is local determinism, that she wants to preserve it. And where does it come from? So of course,
she probably would deny that this is really her preference, but that's what comes across.
I have no, I have no horse in this race, okay. I'm just looking as an observer and it's very clear
that she is sometimes a little too emotional about it. Like, for instance, she basically says
people who don't understand it are idiots, not quite paraphrasing. By the way, she was incredibly,
you know, gracious. She was very calm and so on. But I also read some other stuff she wrote about it
and so do you. And sometimes she goes a little overboard. But also, like, I see how
so the way she wants to sacrifice this was called statistical independence. And Bernardo was arguing
that then science is over. I think he's exaggerating too a little bit. So for him, obviously,
this statistical independence is dear and local determinism is not. You see, but I,
but then neither of them would actually come out and say, look, this is what I call dear to me.
And that's why I build a theory around it. Yes, they wouldn't say that they would say,
but of course, you can't do that because then science would be finished or something. Both of
them kind of because and this is where I feel this is where we can make one more step as a community
where we really would advance as as scientists and human beings is when we will admit to ourselves
to what extent we are motivated by dearly held principles. Like, why does Sabine care about
local determinism so much? I'm asking for a friend, you know, like maybe if she finds out,
if she finds out, maybe she'll learn something about herself. I can tell you why I don't care
about it. For instance, because I think the world is inherently indeterministic in my experience,
it's not. But also for me, actually, this is not so essential, but this Bell's experiment, the
entanglement is not a big deal. What is a big deal in quantum mechanics is non commutativity,
that the observables, familiar observables, like coordinate momentum, and so on, which in classical
physics, they commute with each other. They're like numbers or functions, they become non commutative.
That's why they have to be realized as accurate representing on the Hilbert's case. And this
non commutativity is an absolutely essential phenomenon. Now, mind you, the commutator between,
say, momentum operator and coordinate operator is very small. It's proportional to the Planck constant.
So classical physics, therefore, can be thought of as a limit of quantum when the Planck constant
goes to zero. Likewise, Newtonian mechanics can be thought of as a limit of Einstein's
special relativity when the speed of light goes to infinity.
And likewise, in general relativity, we have curved spacetime. And our traditional view was that we
live in the Euclidean space, which has no curvature. So there are three parameters,
nonzero parameters that were introduced in the 20th century, the Planck constant, which makes the world
non commutative. And to me, I feel that it is a very essential thing. And it is fundamental. And if
you accept that, I don't think superdeterminism can save you. I have not really studied this.
Even if you drop that is independent and so on, there will be phenomena which will not,
in principle, you cannot describe by classical physics, because classical physics is commutative.
So you're trying to fit non commutative world into commutative world. I don't think it's possible,
but I'm not 100% sure. To me, it's a feature, not a bug. Like,
likewise, the fact that the speed of light is finite, and it's the same to all observers,
which is the feature of special activity, is a special thing. It's not something you fight.
My question would be, how much do we want to sacrifice of the scientific things we have
discovered in the 20th century to accommodate our belief systems? For instance, let's suppose I am
interested in local preservation of local determinism. So then I'm willing to postulate
that my experimental apparatus somehow magically behaves and we're in a stress.
Now, Bernardo says, okay, it's weird. It's impossible. That's, I disagree. Quantum
mechanics is weird too. You know, Nils Bohr famously said to somebody, your theory is undoubtedly crazy.
The question is whether it's crazy enough to read. So the fact that it's weird to me doesn't
mean it's wrong. So I keep open mind. It may well be that superdeterminism will become prevail
scientific theory in the next few years. Who knows? I would not be surprised to argue that it's
impossible because it's weird. It's disingenuous. You know, it's disingenuous. For me, the point
is not that the point is that let's admit why this is put as a forefront of a theory. It's
because of a preference. You know, there is this Samuelson, the great economist had this
theory called revealed preference in economics, that sometimes absorbing agents behavior,
you can actually find out what their preferences are. Let's call the revealed preference. To me,
it's a revealed preference. So then my question is, okay, so suppose you have a preference for
preservation of local determinism, and you're willing to sacrifice this, this, and this. Okay,
suppose you have a preference for classical Newtonian mechanics. How much you willing to
sacrifice to pretend that Einstein's reality can be accommodated by experimental apparatus?
So for instance, we know that what happens, one of the predictions of special relativity is
that as you move faster, time goes slows down and distances shrink, right?
How much you willing to ascribe it to some kind of conspiracy between
detectors that you use in your experimental apparatus? Like, I don't think anybody asked
super determinist this question, like, would you be willing also to do that? And if not, why not?
Also, Einstein's generativity says there's curvature, curvature, curvature space time
is the signature of gravity. Suppose you are an adherent of Euclidean geometry, and you don't
believe it's true, because when I look outside of my window, I don't see any curvature. Well,
except curvature of the Earth, but talking about the curvature of space time. How far are you willing
to go to preserve zero curvature in your theory? By ascribing different observed phenomena, for
instance, Eddington discovered that, you know, famously in 1919, Arthur Eddington's expedition
discovered that the ray of light bends around the massive star. Let's suppose you, so, and that
is considered as an experimental verification of Einstein's generativity, the fact that space
time is curved around massive bodies emitting gravitation, gravitational force. Let's suppose
that you like Euclidean geometry, and you are adamant that the world is Euclidean, no curvature.
Are you willing to then say that your experiment is playing away all this, all this experimental
data by saying that it's just the, we should look deeper into how this measuring device is set up.
Maybe there is some weird communication between them, which we are not aware of,
which creates this illusion. Now, I think we have to be consistent. So, if you say, yes,
in principle, you could do that, you could do that. And it's kind of one, we are kind of like in the
same game here, because for us, super determinists, it's very essential to believe that there is
local determinism. We are willing to sacrifice other aspects of our theory to accommodate this.
Then it's a different story. But ask these questions to also see maybe to what extent
you are investing yourself and your preferences into your theory. Something you may actually
accuse others, for example, for example, she has been extremely, Sabin, a Hosenfelder, extremely
helpful in unraveling sort of this fallacy of the string theory and the fact that practitioners
of string theory are still not willing to admit the failure of their enterprise. Sabin has been
extremely positive in my opinion in this. She wrote a whole book called Lost in Maths saying that
we are led astray by our preferences for what we consider beauty and so on. But can we also be
led astray by our preferences for certain philosophy or metaphysics? And it's always nice,
easy to see it with other people. Can we see it in ourselves that we're actually doing something
very similar? Now, then the next question is, do I see it in me too? Because I'm now
saying, I'm not criticizing actually. I'm trying to explain why to me it was like an amazing
Netflix movie. Unfortunately, you need to have some background to understand. But if you do,
it is an incredible case study in how we are being human. And it's normal. But it shows to me also,
it helps me, I want to say thank you so much for showing this to me so clearly.
It's informative about yourself.
Yes, because I'm also, and by the way, it extends beyond science. How often do I find myself
in my life, in my personal life, adhering to certain ideas, knowing full well that
there is no proof for them. But it's just like how I want it to be. And then suffering is a result.
And to see in a microcosm, this process, how we fool ourselves, how easy it is for us to fool
ourselves. Also, for instance, she goes like, I really want to work on this because I am alarmed
by the fact that the collapse of the wave function happens faster the speed of light.
But excuse me, quantum mechanics contradicts special relativity. Everybody knows this.
That's the whole point. That's why we have the next level theory, which is called quantum field
theory. I have not yet seen any superdeterminism addressing local determinism in the framework
of quantum field theory. They tried to do it in quantum mechanics. Okay, so this has been a bit
too harsh on Sabine. So to be fair now, what would you say about Bernardo?
No, he was a bit harsh on her. That's what I would say. But I'm just saying,
Schrodinger equation is non-relativistic. It has a first-time derivative, second-order,
first-order time derivative, second-order coordinate space derivatives. So it is not
relativistic. So therefore, to say that the collapse of the wave function is somehow alarming to us,
but how about Schrodinger equation? It's also non-relativistic. You see what I'm saying?
But it's such a subtle point that it is lost because most people don't really pay attention to this.
I'm trying to say, I feel it. I am like this too. I'm not trying to criticize.
You know Richard Hamming? Yeah, yeah.
He said something which jives completely with what you're saying. Something I wrote down about
I'm going to paraphrase. It's that we tend to think that we arrive at our interpretations of
quantum mechanics. But he said, you start with God, even as a secular person, and then you see
which interpretation is most consistent with that? I think, look, it's the beautiful thing.
To me, it's like my approach is it's all beautiful. It's all beautiful. I loved seeing
both of them, and I wouldn't change a thing. And I don't want them to change except for one little
thing. Each of us asks ourselves, what is driving us really here? And is it really just
scientific principles? Or there is some preference in it? And it's a very small thing. It's no shame
in having a preference. There's no shame in it. Of course, I do. I do. Just be aware of it.
Because that's what leads us astray, I think, is not being aware. That's all. But I think the idea
is very interesting. It is worth exploring. It is not fair to say that you shouldn't explore,
because it sounds crazy or whatever. You know, like it's weird. Okay, quantum mechanics is weird.
So also, Bernardo said something that disagree is like, so basically, you're saying that the moon
depends what you see in the moon, it depends on how you set up your apparatus, your detector. But
we know that in quantum mechanics, the result depends on how you set up your apparatus. If you
do a double slit experiment without detectors, you will see the interference pattern. If you
do it with a detector, you will see particles behavior. So it's not an argument either. You
see what I mean? We are all in a jungle. We are in a jungle. We are trying to find our way.
Let's cooperate. Let's cooperate and let's understand that we all want the same thing.
We want the best theory, the most beautiful theory, the most interesting theory,
the one which fits with experiment. On this path, on this journey, we are informed by many things,
which are personal. And nothing wrong with it. Just accept it. And this will give us maybe new
insights. Over email, you mentioned you wanted to speak about string theory or the Hans beta
onset. So string theory is a good example of where people have gone astray. And Sabina has been one
of the people that called them on this correctly, in my opinion. And was this the example you were
thinking of earlier when you said, you can recapitulate and not me? Yeah. So the theory of everything,
you know, it's like this idea that I was recently invited to a string theory conference. And it
was a very interesting experience for me to not just look at it abstractly, but to actually interact
with people who are considered themselves string theorists. And I saw that it's not very healthy
kind of situation where it's still not been acknowledged by a bit too much hubris.
Not hubris. It's the I think it's more like unwillingness to accept responsibility.
Which is again, totally human, you know, like, it's hard. One was last time I accepted the
responsibility. So maybe I will take a start with myself. I am not a string theorist. I've never
been a string theorist. But I have collaborated with Edward Whitten, who my great respect.
And yes, I found it over the years very useful to drop names and say, I collaborate with Whitten,
you know, I know something about string theory, because when I talk to my non science friends.
So also in love and math, I talk about string theory, but I'm kind of trying to be diplomatic
about it. That it's great for mathematics and physically it hasn't quite worked, but maybe
the fact of the matter is that the original promise of string theory, which was described this universe
by using a theory which starts out in 10 dimensions of space time has not worked out.
And nobody knows how in principle it could work. And it's already been a situation for at least
10 years. Yet, this is not acknowledged. And how can you move forward and achieve greatness
if you're still pretending that your original program is somehow,
if you're not acknowledging that your original program failed, it's just a kind of like a simple
question at the human level, not even scientific level. I did not see that. And I saw young people
very brilliant, but confused, because their elders are not giving them proper guidance. That's my
I may be completely off base here. But I sensed that they're already not doing string theory
proper. So very few talks were about string theory actually proper. And
people were the kind of stuff people work on that I discussed. It's quantum field theory
more generally or maybe study of black holes and stuff like that. But it's not the original
promise was we will find Calabria manifold on which six dimensional, which we'll do away
with the six dimensions. And then we will get the physics of this four dimensional
universe. It has not worked out and nobody knows how to do it. Apart from some ideas of
what's called landscape this multiverse and so on, which I think a lot of people find problematic.
Right. So, so this to me is an example of how again, our personal interferes with the project,
which is of science unwillingness to accept reality. You know, it doesn't mean that the
people should be it's not I'm not saying nobody needs to be punished, don't need to be punished.
Understand. So what is a string theorist to do when you say acknowledge what is the goal?
Is it Ed Whitton writes an article? Is it he goes on a podium? Is it he sends an email out?
And then what happens afterward? What does a string theorist do after one spends four decades,
five decades studying it and then says this wasn't fruitful. But then are they going to
continue studying it for the next decade? I'll tell you what not to do. Okay. How about this?
Let me start with that simple thing. So this I'm actually supposed that not even wrong
blog by Peter White. Peter White was one of the one of the early critics.
He's coming on the podcast in a couple of weeks actually. Yeah, yeah.
No, it's great. Yeah, he's great. And he was very brave because I do remember what happened.
He was one of the lone voice he and the least small one at the time were basically the only
voices. Also, they were ostracized. They were ostracized. They were criticized like they were
stupid. They didn't understand, you know. And for instance, how about in the poll,
how about an apology or at least acknowledgement? Okay, so maybe he was not so stupid after all,
Peter Void or least small and maybe actually they were saying something which was meaningful.
How about that? But also like I'm looking here. So in August of 19, there was a video
discussion about supergravity and so on. And there's a quote here. So I haven't actually watched
the video, but I trust that Peter Void transcribed it correctly. And the Strominger, who is a Harvard
professor and one of the leaders of string theory, I mean, I great respect, of course,
is a great scientist. Here's what he said. I think that the idea that people were excited about back
in 1985 was really a small thing. That's the idea of describing the physics of this universe from
string theory. So he says, it was really a small thing. You know, to kind of complete a table that
you put down the beginning of the spectrum of particles. Who cares about that, right? So except
how much resources were taken to fulfill this promise, right? That was a big promise. And that
was the idea because of which string theory is used to say it's the only game in town.
If you want to do statistical physics, you better come to us
because nobody else is doing anything interesting. So now in 2019, we hear from one of the leaders,
I think that this idea was actually a really small thing. Okay. We didn't do that. We didn't predict
new things that were going to be measured at the Large Adron Collider. But what has happened is so
much more exciting than our original vision. We are getting little hints over a radical new view
of the nature of space and time, in which it really just is an approximate concept emerging
from something deeper. That is really, really more exciting. So in other words, so first of all,
correct, the beautiful ideas came out of string theory. But that was not the original promise
of string theory. The original promise was to describe the physics of this universe,
unify all forces of nature with three forces, electromagnetic, strong and weak described by
the standard model and quantum theory of gravity. This has not happened. And now we hear that actually
it was not such a big deal, such a big thing. We've learned so much more. It's like, you know,
I tried to think of a good analogy. It's like, remember Moses, you took Israelites out of Egypt
and he told them that he will lead them to the Promised Land.
Yes. So imagine Moses after 40 years of wandering in the desert, you would say,
you know, guys, this idea of a Promised Land is not such a big thing. Look how much we've learned.
We've learned about the desert. We've learned so much about the sand.
That's a great analogy. Who cares about the Promised Land? What do you think what people
say to him? And yet here we are. It's a, you know, this is what this is called, by the way,
people call you mentioned this expression, moving the goalposts. This is not moving goalposts. This
is going to a different stadium. It's starting to play a different game. Like you used to play
soccer at one stadium, then you go to another stadium, you start playing baseball and you say,
no, we are playing soccer. We're still playing soccer. Yes, yes, yes, stating that your original
goal is not meaningful. It did not work out. It did not work out. How about just starting with that?
It did not work out unequivocally, not by saying in the next 10 years, you know, I,
I thought I saw a great video. I don't know if you know this channel.
She's called Angela Collier. You know, she has a very nice
YouTube channel and she did a video about string theory. And I really enjoyed it. She kind of,
and one of the things that she kept saying, like she traced the evolution, 90s, the 2000s and so on.
And each time she's like, just wait another 10 years, just wait another 10 years. That's the attitude
even today. I am sorry to say, you know, what, how do if a young person who is in the subject,
it's still called string theory. Okay. You have go to conference and string theory and maybe 20%
of the talks are about string theory. The rest is about other things. People already doing other
things. It's like, you know, in the Soviet Union, when I was growing up, before Gorbachev, like 80s
or 80s, everybody already did not believe in the ideology. They did their own thing. But people were
still trapped because the official ideology, official party line is this. So you have to
somehow accommodate it. You know, so for instance, if you work in history or social science, you always
start a preface every article you write with the great comrade Lenin said this, you know,
things like that. What a liberation it is when you don't have to do it anymore.
What a wait, so in this analogy, what would be the equivalent of praising Lenin or Marx?
Because when you go to a string conference, not like you're saying, Hey, string theory is great.
Now here's my talk, the string theory somehow is still true. It's still trying to search to
is still trying to describe this universe. It's not because well, there are some people trying,
but there's so many, at least say that it did not work out the way we expected. Okay.
People thought, and I also understand to be carried away as a human being, it's not it's
natural. The theory is beautiful. And I have to say also a very strongly that has impacted
mathematics in incredibly powerful ways. For instance, what Strongman talks about is real,
is real the idea of emergence of space time. And the different space times can appear at
different limits of the same theory, like mirror symmetry, stuff like that, incredibly powerful.
Okay. But yes, this came up. But what about your original promise? What about your original promise?
The idea was that you find what the string theory is only defined super string theory in 10 dimensions
of space time, you have to find six dimensions, which the extra, because what we absorb is four
dimensions of space time. So the idea was, we will find the color, the right manifold,
the right shape on which to compact fire, reasonable, reasonable.
What turned out with it, what turned out is that there are too many choices.
But there is more. Actually, this one about one question is that you cannot pin it down.
It's worse because actually dynamically, it doesn't stay static. It changes also the
Calabi Yaw because our modular space of Calabi Yaw is not rigid.
Many of them are not. So it's moving and it becomes singular and nobody knows what to do with this.
So in other words, the magnitude of the problem. Yes, it's possible that somebody
can solve it. And I'm not saying they should not work on it. Of course, work on it.
Uh-huh. But they shouldn't deride other attempts.
But they were extremely heavy handed. There is no question. Like in the same blog
of Peter Voigt, I suggest people to read a testimony from David E. Kaplan. He gave an
interview, this is a post from October 22. It's a devastating, devastating testimony of someone
who was not a string theorist in the heyday of string theory and what he felt about it.
How many others felt the same way? Not to acknowledge it. Not to admit that this
would happen. And there is no promise did not pan out. It's something that holds people back.
In my opinion, they have to be free. They have to liberate it from this weight.
And the only people who can do it are the leaders of the theory. And it doesn't take much.
It just opened the door a little bit for the possibility that our original project did not
work out. Let's see what we can make out of what we have.
How do you think Ed Whitton would respond if he heard what you said? You've collaborated
with him. You know you're part of that community or adjacent to that community.
I'm adjacent. And I have been paying lip service to this community. I have to admit.
In the interest of following my own admonition of what is Edward's involvement.
I was never a string theorist. But I paid lip service because it was convenient to me.
It was nice for me to feel that I am collaborating with such great physicists.
That I would write in love and math that, yeah, who knows, maybe they will find this
collab. Yeah, when I knew full well that it seems way more.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't say it in putting these words. But I was kind of giving the validity,
even in principle, kind of paying lip service to it. Okay, so maybe not yet. But as this woman
who has Angela said, you wait in the next 10 years. So I was kind of giving lip service to it.
You see, that's my contribution. And which I see now was unhelpful. And I am grateful that
there were people like Peter Voigt and Lee Small and and Sabin, as well, who were principled about it.
Eric Weinstein as well.
Eric Weinstein. Yes, yes, absolutely. Eric Weinstein,
who said this for many years, they were had a principled approach to it. And you know,
it's always like this, because you don't want to say because you don't want to offend anybody.
I understand. But at some point, you ask, what is the interest of the community as opposed to
the interest of a single human being or a few single, a few individuals?
Yeah, how do you think the leaders would react to what you just said?
Let's, let's, let's find out.
Look, I look, I respect, I want to say I respect the people. I just want to say I respect and I
think they're brilliant. There's no question, brilliant, absolutely brilliant. And I am honored
that I am honored to have collaborated with them. No doubt about it. We're talking here about not
so much about science involved, but the way a human element somehow became the theme of our
conversation. So I kind of felt that this would be appropriate, appropriate, because also it's one
theory which purported to which sold itself as a theory of everything, you know. And so now 40 years
later, after 40 years wandering in the desert, we hear that actually this promised land is not a big
deal. That's not how you deal with this. That's not. We've seen that happen in history. It is
detrimental. It puts a burden on young people who are trapped in this narrative, even if, even if
they're already doing stuff, which is outside of the purview of string theory. But it would be much
more healthy, in my opinion, in my opinion, only in my opinion, having interacted.
This is a recent opinion of yours now because you've given this talk at the Strings conference.
I have not spoken about this publicly other than I tweeted a little bit about it. I was at the
conference. I was invited to give a challenge talk about the development method. And I put a lot of
effort into it. I put a lot of effort into it. I was very sincere. And I went there with an open mind.
What I saw and experienced during this week, five days in this conference,
was what led me to reconsider my position and led me to speak about it now,
what I have just said. Because on the one hand, I saw brilliant young minds.
Yes. On the other hand, I saw the leaders and no hint from the leaders that somehow maybe we
need to rebrand or pivot or evolve, you know, other than appreciation. They didn't say that.
Then I looked, I started researching. So these are the quotes I found. I find it
not very convincing. Does this strike a nerve with you? Because you also see a parallel with
what happened to you when you were 16, which is this older generation leading a stray, the younger
one. No or no. That's too lucid an analogy. I don't know how you make this connection.
No, of course it is. Of course. But because I put myself in the position of these young people.
I'm not saying that makes it irrelevant or that impacts the power of it.
Yeah. But see, I am aware that my sensitivity of this, that I care. Other people maybe wouldn't
care. So, okay, you invite to some conference, you go and speak. Okay, you feel some of that
energy. So to speak, you know, but okay, it's not your job. So just go and do your thing.
Yet I somehow feel compelled to say this, right? Why? I know why. I'm sensitive to this thing.
And so you're also able to observe it much like people who advocate for breast cancer research,
maybe someone who was close to them was affected. It doesn't mean breast cancer. You
shouldn't invest in it just because you have a personal motivation. No, no. I'm able to see it.
I'm able to feel it. Now, before we go, something else that you mentioned on the
LEX program, and you didn't say that it was a large problem in math, but the problem of
sometimes not giving credit where credit is due. You've seen this happen a couple of times.
And you mentioned that in other fields, there's some unset ethical rules, but in math,
there isn't maybe in physics. Do you mind expounding on that?
Well, it's again, integrity and like, you know, but it's a human community. So this is
the thing. This is the thing which I think is at the root of it is we like to think
that we are the impartial arbiters of pure science and that they're driven by purely by the interest
of science. And I have no doubt that we would like to aspire to be like that. To what extent we
actually can. It's not clear to me by observing myself, first of all.
And so my suggestion is that
it's like, you know, Aldous Huxley talked about the idea about power, that we have to have
restrictions on power. And we gave an interview to CBS. It's a beautiful video. And the interviewer,
Mike Wallace, great journalist. It's really fantastic. Like he's smoking a cigarette, you know,
it's like in the 50s. And he says, why do we have to put this is because the whole point is that
power is dangerous is because people can succumb to the temptation of power. That's why you have
to restrict it. That's the whole point. Because the idea that somehow unrestricted power can be good
for anyone has been repudiated and disproved by centuries and millennia of human history.
And it's the same. It's the same, I think, with the idea of, you know, that somehow
my personal preferences are not involved in what I do in science. Today, we have discussed several
examples, which seem to suggest that this is not so, or it's not so simple. It's much more subtle,
somehow, than that, you see. And so I think that we will not get to the next level of our
evolution. Because also people say, okay, who cares, String Theory? How many people involved?
Hundreds, maybe a few thousand. But it's like canary. It's a canary in a coal mine, in my opinion.
We are the vanguard. We scientists, we are the vanguard. First of all, because
You think it bleeds out into the public?
Yes. Because people unconsciously, they feel it. And actually, Angela Collier, she makes this point.
She actually says people got felt that they were lied to with String Theory. And now they are fed
up with physics. They don't want, they said you lied to us. And I think, okay, I think it's maybe
a little hard, too harsh, but she definitely has a point. So for instance, then people will not
be so interested in the developments of theoretical physics, maybe for the next decade or something,
as because they got burned, they feel that they were like, a lot of the things people feel it,
even if you don't know how to verbalize it, they feel it, you see. So if we don't
get our house in order, and when I say our house, I don't mean String Theory, I mean science in general.
We also have the other side of flip side of it is this people, so-called AI practitioners,
who are feeding lies to people, telling them that AI is already here, and you should pray
to our AI overlords, that they will not destroy you, stuff like that, you know.
In each of these instances, what I think will help us to go to the next level.
And to do the job that we're supposed to do is to realize how much our personal psychology,
our personal aesthetic, metaphysical, philosophical preferences,
how much they are intertwined with what we do as scientists. Just acknowledge that,
and then use it as a starting point for self-inquiry and to raise your self-awareness.
Same goes with the attributions and papers and so on. And sometimes much lesser issue,
in my opinion. For instance, if you have a subject where the leaders of the subject
still cannot acknowledge that mistakes were made, you know, mistakes were made, lessons were learned,
let's move on with this understanding. Then, okay, so then the questions of attributions and so on
is kind of a lesser point. But the source, I think, is the same. It's self-awareness,
or lack of, and taking responsibility out of this here.
Before we close, for me to take responsibility for a lack of attribution, on my part, unintentional,
but it was still a lack of attribution. I did this video on quantum gravity,
the controversial history of quantum gravity's connection to anti-gravity.
I didn't credit Eric Weinstein in the video itself because I didn't use him as a source directly.
I used other people like David Kaiser and a few others as sources.
And I didn't know that some of the people that I had used as sources
used Eric as sources and didn't credit him. And so I just feel bad about that. And so Eric,
if you're watching like, unfortunately, YouTube doesn't allow you to extend a video,
but I can change it. You couldn't put a comment. You couldn't put a comment. Yeah, I did put a
comment and I am leaving this and I apologize. And so see, that's what I'm talking about. This
is, I admire you for this, for accepting this possible. It's much easier to, you know, the
alternative is to find excuses. Yeah, but yes, he was involved, but somehow these other people
did not quote him. So it's not my fault. You see, this is a difference. And you're not going down
that road. And thank you for that. Because, you know, that's how we change it, because we change
our own. Well, thank you because you inspired me, honestly, in many ways, not only through this
conversation, but others that I've seen of you, like on Lex's and also in this book.
Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you. Appreciate it. Me overcoming my embarrassment of,
like I find myself being begrudging, if I'm being honest, because there are some other
podcasters who have large names who have helped them and they're tweeting about them. And I
don't have any of that. And we can all take, we can all exhale, right? Because something is weighing
on us when there is something which is not true. It's weighing on us. And when that simple thing
of just acknowledging is such a breath of fresh air that we can all take a breath,
exhale and move on. That's all. Yeah. Well, again, man, oh man, what a conversation.
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I think this is the second time one hour apart that I said,
all right, let's end it. That just shows you what an engrossing, well, how engrossing the
topics are and how fun this was. Thank you. A lot of interesting stuff. So thank you for
all the great, I really enjoyed it. All right. Well, I hope you enjoyed that podcast. It's
almost three hours over three hour podcast. Thank you for sticking all the way to the end.
Hope you enjoyed it. I think you have because you're still here. I want to recommend a couple
videos, a couple podcasts from theories of everything. If you liked this podcast,
you'll like the ones that I'm about to recommend. But I'd also like to acknowledge a comment.
Every episode from now on, or at least every other episode, I'm going to highlight one of your comments.
The reason is that I don't know if you're like me, but I love talking about these subjects. I love
dealing with these subjects, but it's not like we have, at least for me, many people in my personal
life to speak to about it. So in a sense, it's just relegated to speaking to this screen or
conversing with people over text. And many people take the time to write detailed comments.
Which I love because I read almost every single comment. And I would like to encourage
this comment comes from user Bijou with the pseudonym, a Cronon Master. And it's on the
Carla Revelli clip called There's No Way Function of the Universe. That will be linked in the
description. Bijou says, one way of viewing quantum mechanics is as a measurement theory.
To measure the universe, you really have to be outside the universe. So yes, in that sense,
you could have a wave function of the universe, but it would do you no good. By definition,
if you're external and conducting measurements, you'd be interacting with the system. So you'd
not be truly separate from the system. You'd be at least coupled to it by whatever means you have
for making the measurement. So in that sense, there could not literally be a the universe,
quote unquote. I do like aspects of relational quantum mechanics. The trouble is RQM is like the
mother of all bootstraps, something in brackets, Revelli's God. And I know he considers himself
atheistic, which is not a scientific stance. So whatever has to be absolute for everything
else to gauge off of, so to speak. Okay, you can read the rest of the comment by going to that
video, you'll see, and I didn't plan this, that there's even a reference to the interpretations
of quantum mechanics, having to do with our conception of God, or even the lack of God,
and reasoning backward from these prejudicial axioms, rather than what we think of, which is,
Hey, I'm this rational being, I'm going to reason forward to my interpretation or to my conclusions.
Now, if you liked this episode, then you'll enjoy the Bernardo Castro solo episode. That's
somewhere on screen here, and it'll also be in the description, as well as the Sabina
Haßenfelder interview with Bernardo Castro, where they talk about super determinism,
clip that was just mentioned with Carlo Revelli will also be in the description,
and the clip with Neil deGrasse Tyson, that was alluded to about philosophy is quote unquote
useless, or that philosophy is little to contribute to modern day physics and mathematics.
Also, because Richard Borchard's asked a question, you may not know this, but Richard
Borchard's was interviewed twice on theories of everything. Part one and part two are linked in
the description as well. Thank you so much for your viewership. And I'm glad, or at least I hope
that you enjoyed this episode. The podcast is now concluded. Thank you for watching. If you
haven't subscribed or clicked that like button, now would be a great time to do so as each subscribe
and like helps you to push this content to more people. You should also know that there's a
remarkably active discord and subreddit for theories of everything where people explicate toes,
disagree respectfully about theories and build as a community, our own toes links to both are in
the description. Also, I recently found out that external links count plenty toward the algorithm,
which means that when you share on Twitter, on Facebook, on Reddit, etc, it shows YouTube that
people are talking about this outside of YouTube, which in turn greatly aids the distribution on
YouTube as well. Last but not least, you should know that this podcast is on iTunes, it's on
Spotify, it's on every one of the audio platforms, just type in theories of everything and you'll
find it. Often I gain from rewatching lectures and podcasts, and I read that in the comments,
hey, Toe listeners also gain from replaying, so how about instead re-listening on those platforms?
iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcast, whichever podcast catcher you use. If you'd like to
support more conversations like this, then do consider visiting patreon.com slash
Kurt Jaimungal and donating with whatever you like. Again, it's support from the sponsors
and you that allow me to work on Toe full-time. You get early access to ad-free audio episodes
there as well. For instance, this episode was released a few days earlier. Every dollar helps
far more than you think. Either way, your viewership is generosity enough.
