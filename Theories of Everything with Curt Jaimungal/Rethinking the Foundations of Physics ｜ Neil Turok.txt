Welcome to Theories of Everything. My name is Kurt Geimangel and today we have a special
series, a new series called Rethinking the Foundations. This year, the Rethinking the
Foundations of Physics is centered around the question of what is unification? I'm honored
that I get to bring you an astonishing lecture, tying together almost every unsolved problem
in physics in a bow, so not only a neat bow, but a simple one by Professor Neil Turok.
Professor Turok is a cosmologist who holds something called the Carlo Fidani Roger Penrose
distinguished visiting chair, if I'm not mistaken, at the Perimeter Institute and also the Higgs
chair of theoretical physics at the University of Edinburgh. And to those who are unfamiliar
to physics, if this was the 1800s, those chairs would be called thrones. So anyway,
take it away, sir.
Thank you very much, Kurt. It's a great pleasure to be with you. Let me just start by saying
how much I appreciate your podcast. I think it's running a different way than other ones,
more conversational. And I think that's wonderful to get more discussion, we can have the better.
And so I'm looking forward to lots of interaction with the audience. The issues at stake are
very basic to our understanding of where we sit, why we're here, how we got to be here,
and so on. And I think, hopefully, the ideas I'll explain are accessible enough for everyone
to engage with. Great. So I'm going to show my screen. So the title of my tour is really
designed to address the basic question Kurt is asking in this series, namely what is unification?
And the answer I would give is that unification, understanding the laws of physics and the nature
of the universe in a unified way means understanding the universe, that the laws of physics and the
arena for physics, namely space and time, are really a single entity. And you might think this
was obvious that our best way of understanding the unified laws of physics is to look at the
universe. That's the maximum data we have available. And not to do that is kind of insane,
is that you are trying to invent, you know, things about physics, which are outside the
universe. And perhaps unsurprisingly, this has led people to worry about a multiverse. And this
is kind of the road string theory has gone down. And I feel that road may well be as likely to be a
dead end. And what we have to do is pay much more attention to what we actually see and observe in
the universe. And I believe that for some reason, we don't yet understand what we see and observe in
the universe teaches us about nature at a very profound level. So we have this sort of information
coming in about the universe now. And I believe this is an ideal moment, very opportune moment to
think about unification. But in doing so, we must take that data very, very seriously. That doesn't
mean believing every rumor or slight difference between the basic picture and observations. Many of
those are due to observational problems. They're, you know, these observations are very difficult in
cosmology. Sometimes they make mistakes, and they eventually get corrected over many years or even
decades. So don't take the observations absolutely literally, but do be guided by the broad gist of
those observations. And of course, as in every area of sunets, we may always turn out to be wrong. But
I believe this is the best route to progress is take our theories very seriously, insist on logical
consistency. And but equally insist on realism, that these theories do match and are consistent with
what we see in the universe. So for me, pursuing unification in its own right without thinking
about the universe is a unlikely to be a successful strategy. Equally thinking about the universe
without thinking about unification, as you'll see in this talk, doesn't really make sense, because
the new the universe we see includes logical paradoxes, such as the emergence of everything from a
single point, namely the Big Bang Singularity. And without thinking about unification, we really
don't know how to begin to address those logical paradoxes. So that's the title of my talk. I thought
that since Kurt often has a philosophical flavor to his presentations, which I find fascinating, by
the way. Well, that's one word for it. I thought I'd start with a philosophy philosophical quote,
which is rather nice and echoes what I'll be saying in the talk, that life can only be understood
backwards, namely looking at by looking at our past. That's the only evidence that we have. But
it has to be looked forwards, namely, the future is, of course, the most interesting thing about life
and what we make of the future. And as you'll see in this talk, the past and the future get
connected in very profound ways. And I think we're just beginning to understand what that means.
Now, as a well known in cosmology, looking out from our vantage point on earth, looking out into
space is also looking back in time. And that's because light has a finite speed. And so, as we
look outwards, we're seeing the universe or the objects in the universe as they were
longer and longer ago. So as we look outwards, this is what we see, of course, our solar system
in nearby. But as we go further, this is a logarithmic scale, by the way. So the scale,
the distance scale gets very rapidly longer as you go out in radius.
What is the origin of this picture, by the way? Is this yours?
Oh, yes. I mean, the origin that I've given the credit.
Oh, yes. Yes. No, it's an artistic picture, but I think it's a very beautiful
picture. Essentially, it's telling us what we see when we look out in the universe.
So nearby, we see the solar system, of course, of most distant planets we're seeing as they were
a few minutes or hours ago. But as we go further and further out, we're seeing galaxies and stars
as they were forming up to a billion years ago. And going further outwards, we see what we call
a cosmic web, which is basically structure as it was emerging from an initial smooth, almost
uniform, almost perfectly uniform universe. That's the cosmic web, the sort of fringes on the
outskirts of the picture. If we go even further out with the red circle here is the, what we call
the last scattering surface. It's the hot surface of the radiation coming out of the big bang as it
was radiating the microwaves, which we now receive as the remnant radiation from the hot big bang.
So we're essentially sitting in the middle of a microwave oven. And as we look outwards, we're
seeing the hot surface that was emitting those microwaves. When it was emitting them, incidentally,
its temperature was about 3000 degrees centigrade. So only a factor of two different than the sun.
So essentially, we're outside the sun, but inside a cavity whose surface looks pretty much like
the surface of the sun. And then if we go even further out before that surface, I imagine
we're using a form of light which can penetrate the hot radiation of the big bang, for example,
gravitational waves, which would do so. We reach the white circle, which is the big bang
singularity. And so that seems to be the beginning of the universe, which we are surrounded by,
although actually it's a point. Now to see how that works, keep in mind that this picture I'm
showing now is really a cross section of a four dimensional universe, namely time and space.
And we are connected to every point on this picture by a light ray. So this is what we
actually see. But if I try to draw the four dimensional picture, I've got to add the time
dimension as well as space. And you see, if we are sitting on the right of this picture
in the center of this patch of space around us, the green curves here show the trajectory
of light or something traveling at the speed of light. As it came out of the big bang singularity,
it then traveled outwards at the speed of light. But of course, you've got to also take into account
the effect that as you go backwards in time, the universe is shrinking in size.
So what looks to us in this picture as a big circle on the outskirts of what we can see
is actually this focal point on the left, where all those light rays in fact
came out of the same point in space. Professor, is there anything special about this point where
if you look toward the middle of this, it initially is going up, it's sloping up to the right,
and then it starts sloping down to the right. Is there anything special about that point where
it changes? No, no, there's nothing special. This is just, you see, so if I had drawn this,
the curve for an observer living a billion years ago, only 12.7 billion years after the big bang,
the light would converge a little bit to the left of where I've drawn it,
and so it would bend downwards a bit sooner than the curve I show. So this curve is really,
if you like, the curve that we see being where we are in space and time in the universe,
it's our past horizon or our past light cone. So normally in special relativity,
you learn about light cones, but they're obtained just by drawing straight lines and then making
them into a surface of revolution. The difference in an expanding universe is that the light cones
themselves shrink down to a point at the big bang singularity because the universe is shrinking
as we go back in time. So this is what we can see. We see a slice of the universe,
and weirdly enough, the outskirts of this slice are actually a single point,
which is the big bang singularity, and that's what we want to resolve. And so everything I'm
going to tell you about today rests on a resolution of that strange paradox that the whole universe
came out, the universe we see, came out of a single point. Now, as well as the arena for physics,
we need to, of course, think about the laws of physics, and the laws of physics we know
are shown in this picture. We have the particles, namely the quarks and the leptons,
and so the quarks make up nuclear matter, protons and neutrons, and versions there are. There are
three families of quark, each of them containing an uptight quark and a downtight quark. And then
we have leptons, which are generalizations of the electrons, which orbit around atoms,
and there are, similarly, three families of leptons, each with an electron-like particle
and each with a neutrino-like particle. So those are the particles, and then we have the forces,
which are the electro-weak and strong forces, and those are mediated by gauge bosons.
The particles we describe as fermions, they're described by Dirac's equation. So all of these
things are very well established. The Higgs boson somehow connects all of them because the Higgs
boson is responsible, or the Higgs field is actually responsible for breaking the symmetry
in the standard model, and it contributes mass to all of these particles that you see in this
picture. So those are laws of particle physics, and then I've drawn gravity as this blue curve
that sort of couples to everything because gravity is really universal and gravity feels
everything else in the picture. So we have to somehow combine all of these laws
with this picture of the universe in order to try to make a coherent picture,
and where it doesn't work, we have to extend these laws to make it work.
Now, as I mentioned, we live outside the sun, so this is the hot surface of the sun,
and it's completely remarkable that the color of the sun tells us Planck's constant. I mean,
it actually, the fact that the sun has a single color, and it has a temperature of 6,000 degrees,
one can infer from the color directly Planck's constant, and so if there were no quantization
of photons, hot objects like the sun simply could not exist. It's the quantization of light
which allows hot objects to exist without radiating an infinite amount of energy.
If you take the Planck's constant to zero, you find the rate of radiation from the sun
would go to infinity, and the sun would disappear in a puff of smoke in no time at all. So this is
an example of how the universe teaches us its laws, and this is not how Planck's law of radiation
was discovered because people didn't really understand what the sun was at that point in time,
but it could have been, and so by taking the observations as seriously as possible,
trying to make them consistent, one actually learns all about the fundamental laws of physics,
and right now we're doing the same with the other version of the sun, if you like,
which is this cosmic microwave background sphere within which we live. It's a hot radiating surface
by looking at it. We can see what happened at the Big Bang singularity.
Why do you call it the other version of the sun?
Well, in this picture, you see the sun is at the center of the picture, and we orbit around it,
but the red sphere represents, obviously this is a two-dimensional cross-section of a sphere,
and the spherical, the red circle on this picture represents a sphere which surrounds us,
a two-dimensional sphere on the sky which surrounds us, and it's hot, and it was
radiating radiation at about 3000 degrees C when, or Kelvin, when the radiation decoupled,
it's called a surface of decoupling, and so the radiation decoupled from the hot plasma
in the Big Bang, and the radiation just traveled freely from that surface to our telescopes at
the center of the picture. So, you know, we're outside the sun, we're inside the surface of
last scattering or this red surface, and by staring at the red surface, we hope to learn
the equivalent of the laws of quantum mechanics which we could have learnt by staring at the sun.
So, here is the surface, here is that surface plotted in much more detail, so this picture shows
a projection onto a plane of that two-dimensional spherical surface which surrounds us,
called the surface of last scattering, so this is very much like a map in an atlas
representing the surface of the Earth, this is a two-dimensional map representing the sphere
that surrounds us, and what you notice, what's plotted is the temperature of the radiation
on that surface as projected forward to the present day, and that temperature varies from
point to point on that surface, and these are the fundamental variations of temperature and density
which came out of the Big Bang and which later were responsible for the creation of structure
in the universe, so these variations are very small in magnitude. The temperature of the surface,
as I mentioned, was about 3000 degrees Kelvin when it emitted the microwave radiation,
but the temperature varied from place to place by about one part, by a few parts in 100,000,
and so the variations in temperature plotted on this picture are very modest in size, just a few
parts in 100,000, but you can see the pattern of temperature variations, and this picture
has been made by a number of beautiful experiments including the Planck satellite,
so we now have access to it. The top curve, let's start with the bottom curve, the bottom curve
shows what happens if I look at this map with a Fourier lens, namely a Fourier transform it with
respect to spherical harmonics on the sky, and then I plot the magnitudes of those spherical
harmonics, the average magnitude against L, the harmonic number, and you see this beautiful red
curve on the bottom, this was actually predicted in the early 1970s by Jim Peebles and others,
and later Jim Peebles won the Nobel Prize for that. It's a rather clear-cut prediction,
but it rests on a particular assumption about the cosmological parameters,
which I'll get to in a moment. So the temperature pattern has this oscillatory
power spectrum, above that is the polarization power spectrum, and I'm particularly proud of this
because this is a calculation we did for the first time when I was a young cosmologist,
so we calculated the red curve, and then rather amazingly the data points are the blue points,
and you can see they fit perfectly on that curve. Now the key point is that this is with no free
parameters. You fit the free parameters of the cosmology to the bottom curve,
and then just predict the top curve, and it fits spectacularly well. That's not because we were a
particular clever with our calculation, we weren't. We simply turned the crank on a way of calculating
this invented by Chandrasekhar in the 1930s, but the difference is that we have the data,
and we can turn that data into predictions, and they fit beautifully with what we see.
So in other words, for the bottom graph, that's a temperature graph,
yes, you have some knobs that you can fiddle with, and these are called the parameters.
That's right. How many are there?
Five, just five.
So there are five parameters that go into there, and then you've developed when you were a young
student, a function that takes in those five parameters and outputs that top graph.
Yes.
But those parameters were fixed by someone else for the bottom graph.
Absolutely.
So there were no new parameters you had to introduce for the top one.
We had no freedom to introduce parameters. So all that went into the top curve are the
Einstein equations for gravity, and the equations for the propagation of radiation,
which, as I say, were developed by Chandrasekhar in the 1930s, and they just used Maxwell's
equations and interactions of light with electrons. So we didn't do anything.
We were the engineers in this game. We just took the known laws and applied them.
Nobody had bothered to do the top calculation because, frankly, they didn't expect to see it
ever measured. I persuaded the experimentalists on the point satellite to include detectors
to measure the polarization. You see, the numbers are tiny.
If you look at the units in the top curve, it's micro-kelvin squared.
So they had to measure the polarization with an accuracy of a few micro-kelvin,
two or three micro-kelvin. That's a very big task.
Yes. Well, you must not have been just some whipper snapper then to have such influence
over someone to develop such a sophisticated tool by merely suggesting it.
Well, I was lucky. As I say, all the equations were lying around in the literature.
Nobody had bothered. Actually, some people had bothered, but they'd gotten it wrong.
You can make lots of mistakes in theoretical calculations.
As far as I know, we were the first people who actually did it seriously and correctly,
we got the curve and it agrees beautifully.
This change was a turning point in my career because you look at this curve and you say,
my goodness, the universe is simple. We have five basic parameters, as I explain in a moment.
We fit those to some data set. Could be the temperature in the lower curve, could be the
galaxy distribution, many other forms of data. Fit it to some data and predict everything else.
The claim is that everything we see is fit by these five parameters. You can measure those
five parameters in multiple ways. This is called the Lambda CDM model. Really, it's amazing that
it's so simple and so far fits everything. The more and more data we've got, the better the fit.
It's really quite remarkable. There are always some tensions. People claim the Hubble constant
isn't quite consistent and so on, but be very careful about believing those because, quite often,
they are later found to be wrong. Many of them are only two sigma or two and a half sigma.
So, so far.
So, that's what you were referring to earlier in the talk when you said, don't believe every rumor?
Yes, exactly.
I see. So, every week or every year, there's a new tension or anomaly?
Absolutely. Most of them just fade away and people forgot about them.
What has survived is a remarkably simple model, which, as I say, seems to be consistent within
three sigma or four sigma. I mean, particle physicists like to use five sigma. They never
believe anything less than five sigma. That's a good rule. I would say, actually, in applying it
to cosmology, cosmological measurements are much more difficult to control than particle
physics experiments. They're not in the lab. You're measuring the natural universe. I would say our
criterion for accepting a measurement should be stronger than five sigma.
If it's five sigma in particle physics, surely in cosmology, it's got to be seven or eight sigma.
If you apply that criterion, there are no anomalies with this model. So, here's the model.
It's called Landau CDM. It's more or less what Einstein envisaged in his very first paper on
cosmology. Einstein asked himself, what is the simplest form of matter or energy? He knew they
were equivalent because E equals mc squared. He knew mass and energy are equivalent. If you just say,
what's the simplest conceivable form of energy, the answer is very obvious. It's the cosmological
constant, which is what he invented. It's a form of energy which is absolutely uniform in space,
in time, and, furthermore, is what we call Lorentz invariant. Namely, if you travel
at some velocity, this stuff doesn't change at all. No matter how fast you travel,
the cosmological constant is exactly the same as it was when you, if you're not traveling.
So, he invented the cosmological constant, tried to make a model of cosmology with only
that constant. It didn't work because he tried to make a static universe, actually. He didn't know
the universe was expanding. The Landau CDM model includes the cosmological constant,
which is 70% of the known energy in the universe. It includes dark matter. That's a big mystery,
but in this talk, I'm going to resolve that mystery by explaining what the simplest
candidate is for the dark matter. Actually, I've already shown it to you on a previous slide.
I'll explain why, but the dark matter makes up about 25% of the energy in the universe,
and the remainder is in nuclear particles and electrons, just the stuff ordinary matter is
made of, and, of course, photons. So, there are five parameters in the model. One is the density
of the cosmological constant, how much energy there is in what we call lambda per cubic meter.
The second one is how much dark matter there is, again, just how much per cubic meter in the universe,
and the final one is the proportion of nuclear matter to photons, and that's a free parameter
in the model. Actually, it will be explained by the picture I will describe, not predicted,
but explained. Namely, there are enough free parameters in the laws of physics to fit the
number of nuclear particles per photon from what we already know. Now, the fourth and fifth
parameters describe the variations in density across the universe. This cosmic web, as you see
in the picture, the variations on the temperature map of the microwave background radiation.
Those require very simple form of density variations. It's known as random Gaussian noise,
which means it's just like ripples on the surface of the sea. There are no complex structures.
It's literally a random superposition of waves where the waves have a particular
strength or power as a function of wavelength. So, there are two parameters there. One is the
amplitude. This is about the one part in 100,000 that I mentioned before. That's the amplitude
of these primordial density waves, and the second parameter is what's called a red tilt.
It means that the waves get ever so slightly stronger as you go to longer wavelengths.
In condensed matter physics, such a phenomenon is very familiar. It's called a critical exponent.
It means that basically the fluctuations either get a little bit stronger with scale
or a little bit weaker with scale, but this scales in a certain way. In the case of cosmology,
the red tilt means that if I go to wavelengths 10 times as long, the amplitude of the ripples
increases by 5%. That's not much. I think if I go a billion times longer in length scale,
the amplitude doubles. Can one also interpret that as it being more numerous?
No. It's just that the strength of the wave gets a little bit stronger. The waves are all random
Gaussian. It's literally just a random superposition of waves,
but when I say the strength of the waves, I mean the amplitude of the waves,
the fractional change in the density. What I meant was that if you were to add two waves,
of course they would have to be directly on top one another, then you can interpret that as two
medium sized waves giving rise to something that's one large.
You could, but when you say random Gaussian noise, you're saying that I just take a bunch of waves
of a given wavelength, point them in random directions with random phases and throw them on
top of each other. Then I pick waves of another wavelength, need to tell you how strong those
waves are. Again, make a random superposition of them and put them on top of each other.
Everything we see is consistent with that. Random Gaussian noise with two parameters
describing the power spectrum. One is the amplitude and the other is this slight tilt.
At the end of the talk, I'm going to tell you that our theory predicts numbers four and number five
are almost on the nose. Based on the laws of physics, we already know.
It's very striking and we'll see if this holds up. Essentially, it's problem solved,
but we'll see. As you can imagine, I am really quite excited about this.
Now, dark matter. I used to believe that dark matter was the one sure indication we had
of physics beyond the physics we know, the laws of particles and forces which I showed you.
We thought, many people thought, the dark matter must be made of something else,
another particle. Literally, there are tens of thousands of suggestions
as to what the dark matter might be. Many, many people have built their careers
inventing and then trying dark matter particles or other explanations and then trying to test those
in experiments. In fact, we can see the dark matter quite directly now. This is a beautiful
picture from the ACT experiment. ACT is a Atacama Cosmology Telescope and it's actually
measuring the microwave radiation. That's what the picture shows. The surface on the left is
emitting light. What we see is the map on the right and as the light travels through the universe,
it gets deflected by the gravity of the dark matter. Just like water in a glass of water
will deflect whatever's behind the glass of water so that when you look through it, you'll see it
lensed by the water. Dark matter does the same thing. You can use this to literally measure
using the bending of light. You can measure the density of dark matter and you can measure the
density variations in the dark matter. This all fits beautifully with the Lambda CDM model.
Would you, in order to do that, have to know the left mole CMB?
No, you don't need to know it. What you need to do is to assume that the left mole CMB is random
Gaussian noise with a power spectrum, which has been measured by the Planck satellite. Just two
numbers specify the spectrum. Then what you do is the only thing you measure is on the right,
which if you can see, they put streaks on that map. The streaks show the effect of the lensing.
It basically stretches spherical peaks. If you have random Gaussian noise, the peaks tend to be
quite spherical, but if you lens it, that tends to shear the pattern. It turns out you can just
measure the shear in the pattern due to gravitational lensing. From that shear, you can infer the
density of the dark matter. It's really amazing all this works. With those five parameters,
you can fit everything and there is no inconsistency. This has all become rather precise.
I mean, these gravitational lensing measurements are now involved huge amounts of data, and they're
all absolutely compatible. In some sense, it's very disappointing. People design this,
these enormous expensive telescopes that go through this huge data analysis,
they would love nothing more than to find a contradiction. That would be super exciting.
Well, they haven't found one. On the contrary, everything fits remarkably well.
So let's come back to the biggest puzzle of all. How on earth did everything we see come out of a
point? The key, I believe, is a certain symmetry in the laws of physics we already know. Namely,
the laws of those forces of nature, one of which is electromagnetic forces, the light,
the laws of light and electric and magnetic fields, and the laws of particle physics we know,
which were written down by Dirac equation. Those two theories happen to have a symmetry
under rescaling space. So this is actually the reason why a light wave is essentially the same
as an x-ray. An x-ray is just a scaled down version of a light wave. You just shrink the length
scale, shrink the wavelength of the light, and you'll get an x-ray. Expand the wavelength of the
light and you'll get a radial wave. Light is essentially the same thing, scaled up and down.
It can come in all forms. They all obey the same equation. They just have longer or short. It's
uniquely specified by the wavelength. The reason the theory behaves like that, it has a symmetry.
The symmetry is scaling symmetry, rescaling length and time. You get a shorter or longer
wavelength, higher frequency or lower frequency light. Now, Dirac's equation has the same property
as long as you ignore the masses of the particles. In other words, when these equations are taken
to be massless limit, and the Big Bang is exactly such a place because the plasma is extremely hot,
so masses are irrelevant there. It's very tempting to believe that at the Big Bang singularity,
essentially there was nothing but light and light-like particles, and they all have this scaling
symmetry. Now, that scaling symmetry is very deep, very profound, and what it's telling us in sort
of colloquial terms is that the matter did not know about the size of the universe. It evolves in
such a way that it doesn't care that the universe is shrinking as we go back in time, and so the
matter is evolving as if the universe were in fact not shrinking to a point, or can be described
mathematically with ignoring the shrinking away of the universe. This is what we noticed about
the Einstein equations and the laws of radiation. They have that the Big Bang singularities are
very particular type of singularity called a conformal singularity. Conformal, and I'll tell
you a little bit more about conformal. Conformal symmetry, this is a picture which sort of illustrates
this. So light and particles are described as gauge fields and fermions in the Standard Model,
a la Maxwell and Dirac. Now conformal symmetry is a symmetry of light and massless particles.
Conformal symmetry means that you can actually rescale space and time locally,
and the equations are invariant. So here's an example. Imagine I was solving Maxwell's equations
inside a cylinder. So the boundary of the cylinder was a circle as the last picture shows.
Alternatively, imagine I was solving Maxwell's equations inside a square pipe. So the cross
section was a square. Conformal symmetry tells you those two situations are actually identical
as far as the light is concerned. So the grid you see on the right, that's just a coordinate grid.
It's useful for writing down equations or putting them on a computer, but it has no
particular physical significance. Now if I distort the square on the right into the
disc on the left with a conformal transformation, that means a local change of scale, which does
not change angles. It only changes lengths. I get the picture on the left. So that's another grid.
I could solve the Maxwell's equations on that grid. And then the statement of conformal symmetry
is that these two things give exactly the same result. So these funny points where you see this
pile up of grid points in the last hand picture, they're a little bit like the Big Bang singularity.
There's a sort of pile up of space into a point. And what it's saying is you just have to blow that
up with a conformal transformation. Just expand your grid. And the equations are just the same
in the new picture. So we actually use this picture to make sense of the Big Bang singularity.
So we go back to the Big Bang singularity. Now imagine blowing up that singularity. I don't
mean in the sense of explosion. I mean in a mathematical sense, like changing the scale
of space. So one can do this mathematically. And then the singularity actually becomes a
finite. It's not a point. It's now a finite patch. And then we impose a boundary condition
on that patch, which implements mirror symmetry. So that initial patch at the Big Bang,
we treat as if it were a mirror. So normally when we deal with let's say Maxwell's equations
in a mirror, the propagation of the light in the presence of mirror, there are two ways to do it.
Either you impose a boundary condition at the mirror. You say that transvert the electric field
parallel to the mirror has to be zero. And you literally solve the equations showing how
the light travels to the mirror, bounces off the mirror and comes back. That's one way of doing it.
It's actually a very rather tedious way of doing it. There's a much nicer way of doing it, which is
to say, look, I'm looking at myself in the mirror. If I'm right-handed, let me make a left-handed
version of myself, put that behind the mirror. So it's a fictitious person. That's literally a
mirror image of me. Put it behind the mirror in equal distance from the mirror, throw the mirror away
and just solve Maxwell's equations for the light coming from that person to me.
That's called a method of images in physics. It's a very elegant way of solving boundary value
problems. And what we're claiming is that you can apply the same method to describe the Big Bang,
the Big Bang is a mirror. So I literally take the post-bang universe, make an image of it
before the Big Bang. And then I would just propagate light and particles from that pre-bang universe
through the Big Bang singularity because of conformal symmetry. That propagation is completely
smooth and regular and predictable. And I propagate that forward to see what we see.
So we claim that this extended or mirror universe picture is absolutely compatible with everything
we see in the universe. So in a certain sense, when we look back towards the Big Bang, we are
seeing our own image. That the Big Bang is a boundary condition.
It's not, you shouldn't think about, you see, the conventional way about thinking about the
Big Bang, which I think leads to terrible paradoxes, is that somebody input all the stuff in the
universe at the Big Bang and sort of throw it apart. Right. What we're doing is the opposite
of that. We're saying, no, the Big Bang, all that happens in the Big Bang is a boundary condition
which the matter has to respect. If you look at this, the traditional way is that
someone or something just spurred everything into existence from that single point.
Exactly. But then you're saying that this is an improved picture. However, it just looks like
someone or something spurred all from all points at once. So it doesn't seem like much of an
improvement. So tell me why this is different. Right. No, good question. You might say
our picture looks like somebody made two universes so surely it's twice as difficult.
Yes. No, good point. What we're saying is that there is a, yeah, in fact, the answer is this.
Great. Natural lead up. Yes. The answer is this. So the most fundamental law of physics we know,
which is a direct consequence of quantum mechanics and relativity is called CPT symmetry. CPT
symmetry was discovered in the 30s and 40s as an inevitable consequence of bringing quantum
mechanics and relativity together. So it underlies quantum field theory. Now, what is CPT symmetry?
CPT symmetry says the following that if I turn, if I look at some physical process
and, and I try to make another physical process
using a law of symmetry. Okay. So take some physical process, turn every particle into its
antiparticle. That's what the C does. P invert space. So literally just
send any space coordinates in, in three dimensional space to its inverse. X goes to minus X.
Okay. That's an inversion of space. That's a very dramatic thing to do. But the laws, you know,
you can do this with the laws of physics. T is time reversal. So whatever's going forward in time,
make it go backwards in time. The CPT theorem in relativistic quantum physics tells you
that the rate for any process and its CPT conjugate process is identical. Okay. So this is
kind of analogous to time reversal in Newtonian mechanics. You know, in Newtonian mechanics,
you can take any, the laws of motion and reverse time. And because the second order equations in
time, you know, they are invariant. So Newtonian mechanics has no arrow of time. And in relativity,
the generalization is CPT. So we take our observed universe, the right hand part of this picture.
It has more matter than antimatter. Okay. So it is not invariant under C.
And it's not invariant under T. It's going one way in time. And so the right hand side of this
picture violates CPT. What you would, but if you apply CPT to the right hand side of the universe,
what you get is the left hand side. Namely, every particle goes to its anti-particle.
What was going forwards in time moving to the right in the right hand part of the picture
is now going forwards in time moving to the left in the left hand part of the picture.
And so the statement is that if you want the universe to respect the laws of physics,
in the most obvious way, namely that it is invariant under CPT, then you are led to this
doubled picture. And in the doubled picture, there is then a very natural boundary condition,
which is symmetrical under CPT. And the boundary condition is the one that we use.
So we're saying the Big Bang is a CPT mirror. And this resolves the fundamental puzzle of why
the universe appears to us to violate its own laws. We said more matter than antimatter,
that looks like the universe is not invariant under C. Likewise, we see time going one way.
And that's incompatible with the fact that the laws of physics are invariant under
reversing time and changing matter to antimatter. So what we're doing here is an extremely minimal
application of CPT to the universe. And the consequence is this mirror universe hypothesis.
So to put it differently, anyone who makes any other hypothesis
is going to have to violate CPT. And that's a losing battle. So we were very surprised.
So in Newtonian mechanics, if you take a ball and there's no friction and you drop it,
then it comes right back up. Exactly. Okay, now if you were to look locally, if you were to just
look at half a second, you would say, well, look, there is a difference between the future and the
past because in the past it starts to go down, but in the future it starts to go up. But you're
saying, well, you have to look at the whole picture. Of course. So let's take the full movie.
Okay, so now philosophically speaking, we used that word earlier. What is someone who's watching
this supposed to feel? There's some religions that say something or someone or the universe
started itself and you experienced this world once. Then there are some other traditions that
say you experience it cyclically, infinitely. And then there's here, which seems to suggest,
well, you experience everything twice. No, because you see, when I say we're using the method of
images to impose a boundary condition at the Big Bang. So this picture is a mathematical picture,
a device, which is useful in order to impose a particular boundary at the Big Bang. So
in this picture, the universe in a certain sense creates itself. Okay, it's extremely minimal.
Everything I described could be described by just taking the right half of the picture
with this boundary condition, which is in effect the result of doubling it
and imposing the symmetry. You see, if I double it and impose a symmetry,
the doubling goes away, right? Because the left and right halves are identical.
So then to be specific, is it correct to say the Big Bang is a mirror?
Yes. For mathematical convenience, it's useful to model the Big Bang as a mirror. Is that the
more elaborate correct statement? No. Or the Big Bang is a mirror is the correct statement?
Correct statement is the Big Bang is a mirror. And for any mirror, it is useful to double
the universe. I see. The doubling is just a mathematical trip, which you can use for any
mirror. And we're saying that literally the Big Bang is a mirror. So I would say that this,
I mean, certainly in my experience, and I've worked with Stephen Hawking and I've worked with a number
of other such people on scenarios for cosmology, there is no doubt this is the most economical
hypothesis you can make. And because it's consistent compatible with the laws of physics
and extremely minimal. So either it's right or it's wrong. We'll see. That's the attractive feature
of this whole setup is that it is eminently disprovable. And that makes it interesting.
So, yeah, as I mentioned, these laws, the particles and forces actually do have this symmetry
under local changes of scale. And that allows us to resolve the Big Bang singularity
to blow up the point everything came from into a patch. And then that patch is the mirror
at the Big Bang. This is actually all the particles we know. Now, notice something funny
about this picture. Alright, so the neutrinos in the bottom left have a superscript L, okay,
meaning that they are left handed. If they are traveling along in the direction of your,
of the thumb of your left hand, the spin follows the fingers of your left hand.
So it's rather strange that the light neutrinos we see only come in the left handed variety.
All the other particles have a right handed and a left handed version.
Now, so that is, you know, what we see in laboratory experiments. We only ever see
left handed neutrinos. However, if we were, yeah, so if we were to,
to imagine the simplest or the most minimal conceivable extension of the standard laws of
physics, what would it be? And I just made it, right? I went from this slide to that slide
by removing the L. Okay. Now, all the particles have both left and right handed versions. Okay.
And my claim, our claim, this is worth lathe and boil, our claim is that removing that L,
in other words, giving the neutrinos a right handed as well as a left handed version,
allows you to solve the problem of dark matter. Okay. In an extremely minimal way with the mirror
hypothesis. So now imagine these are the laws of physics. There's no L anymore on any particle.
Every particle has left and right versions. Now what happens is I take my left handed
neutrino, it's coming in from the left. It then, what we call, we say that it can oscillate into
a right handed neutrino, the new right in the middle, and oscillate back into a left handed
neutrino on the right. Now the left handed neutrinos are very light neutrinos are very
like particles, they don't have much mass. If the right handed, if the right handed neutrino is very
heavy, then this process can only be a virtual process. You can't, you had a certain amount of
energy, you can't stay as a right handed neutrino, you just don't have enough energy to account for
its mass. So you've got to go back to being a left handed neutrino. So this is what we call
neutrino oscillations, that the left handed neutrinos can oscillate briefly into a right handed
neutrino. And then they find themselves in, if you like, they've got more mass than they can
account for with their energy. And so they go back into being a left handed neutrino.
This mechanism is, is a mechanism for giving the left handed neutrinos a small mass.
And neutrino masses started to be measured in the 1970s. And this mechanism was quickly
realized as the simplest explanation for those masses. Namely, if there are right handed neutrinos,
which are very heavy, this would explain why the left handed neutrinos are very light.
You see the heavier the right handed neutrino, the shorter the time you're going to spend
you're going to spend as a right handed neutrino. And so basically, the heavier you make it,
the less and less probable it is that the neutrino oscillates in this way. And so
this, it's called the seesaw mechanism, because the heavier you make the right handed neutrino,
the lighter the mass of the left handed neutrino. So this was understood in the 70s.
And at that time, people could have said, Oh, well, maybe the dark matter is a right handed
neutrino. You see, the right handed neutrino is a very obvious candidate because it has no
electromagnetic charge. It doesn't couple to the strong or the weak force at all.
So the only thing the right handed neutrino couples to is the Higgs field, this thing
mentioned, noted by H and gravity. So for the right handed neutrino to be the dark matter,
all you need to do is a switch off this coupling. Okay, so actually, this is the important one,
you don't want. So for the right handed neutrino to be the dark matter, the only problem is that it
can decay. This diagram shows the right handed neutrino decaying into a Higgs and a left handed
neutrino. So if you want the right hand, the dark matter to be stable, you know, it has to have
survived for at least 14 billion years, you've got to switch off this vertex. And if you switch
off that vertex, you must switch off this vertex because they're the same vertex. And if you do
that, it means the left handed neutrino cannot oscillate into the right handed neutrino. And
this actually means the left handed guy must be massless. So just from this picture, you can see
that if the dark matter is stable and consists of right handed neutrinos, then it's plausible that
one of the left handed neutrinos is massless. And that's actually our prediction, which is going
to be tested in the next five years. So now how do we, the second thing you've got to do is you've
actually got to make these right handed neutrinos, right? How do they get made? And the way they
get made is rather beautiful. You see, if I switch off this vertex, the right hand, put a right hand,
one, the, the, there are actually three of these right handed neutrinos and three vertices. So
I'm somewhat simplifying the story. But if I take one of them and I switch off its vertex,
then it actually doesn't couple to anything except gravity. So this poor right handed neutrino is
sitting there in the universe. It doesn't see the hot plasma at all. And the mystery is how did it
get created? You know, what determines its abundance? And so this was actually our first
starting point with this whole picture. We realized the right handed neutrinos are produced as
Hawking radiation from the Big Bang. That it is simply the time dependence of the universe
that creates these right handed particles. It literally pulls them out of a vacuum,
which is a process called Hawking radiation. It's due to gravity. It's due to their coupling
to gravity and due to the fact that the universe is expanding.
So what we show it is that if their mass was 500 million times the mass of a proton,
then they account for all the dark matter we see. And this is the simplest yet explanation
for the dark matter. It's just right handed neutrinos. They were created by the expansion
of the universe. To calculate that creation, we had to assume a particular quantum state
for the right handed neutrinos. And what we do is to use the state defined by CPT symmetry
and the mirror hypothesis. Okay, so all of this is kind of self consistent.
And is that a bound on the mass of the right handed neutrino? Or is that like an actual
prediction for it? It's an exact prediction. Okay, that has to be its mass. Now it's very hard
to measure indirectly. I mean, you would have to literally have a little gravimeter
and go through space and wait until the right handed neutrino traveled past you
and measure the deflection due to its mass. Okay, one day that will be possible. It's not
possible today. But no, this is a very precise prediction of its mass. There are no free parameters
in that prediction. So if it's stable, the lightest neutrino is massless. Why? Because to make it
stable, I had to switch off this vertex. And if I switch off this vertex, I have to switch off that
one. And that means this left handed neutrino cannot acquire a mass by becoming a virtual
right handed neutrino for a little while. So the prediction is the lightest neutrino, namely
one of these left handed neutrino is, is exactly massless. And amazingly, this is now possible
using the Euclid survey, satellite telescope survey now underway. And basically what you do is
measure the strength of clustering of galaxies, strength of clustering galaxies on on a certain
scale, which corresponds to the, well, yeah, let me let me start again. The way you measure
neutrino masses using galaxy surveys, and it's quite extraordinary that you can do this, is by
measuring the strength of the clustering of matter. Now, if the neutrinos are massless,
they do not clump with the rest of the matter. If they have a mass, then as the universe expands,
they actually slow down relative to the expansion, because the mass kind of becomes important,
and they no longer are moving at speed of light, they slow down, and they clump with the other
matter. And that effect turns out to be large enough that by measuring the clustering of galaxies,
you can measure the mass of the neutrino. And so they claim they will be able to check
that the lightest neutrino is massless to within about five sigma, quite accurately,
using these forthcoming galaxy surveys within the next five years. So should this prediction
be confirmed, my claim is that this will be easily the most compelling explanation for the dark matter.
There are other predictions. We can predict the decay rate of atomic nuclei, a process called
neutrino less double beta decay, but that process is very, very slow and may take one or two decades
to measure. It's a very, very tough experimental test, but if this one works out, there will be very
strong motivation for doing nuclear physics experiments to check this idea that the dark
matter is the right-handed neutrino. So where do we get to? Well, the Big Bang was a special
type of singularity. The size of the universe is governed by what we call the scale factor,
this comes into the metric on spacetime. And what happens is that as time goes to zero,
this scale factor, the size of the universe, shrinks to zero in a very simple way, just linearly in time.
When it hits zero, we call that a conformal zero. And meaning that the scale
shrinks to zero, the overall scale shrinks to zero. So colloquially, the universe is at a point.
But as I mentioned, you can always blow up the scale, essentially by dividing by this
quantity that goes to zero, you can blow it up and that becomes the mirror. So this conformal zero
in this picture of the Big Bang becomes, in fact, an extended three-dimensional mirror
in what we call the conformal frame. And so one way of saying it is that the conformal
four geometry is actually regular at the Big Bang. So this is a resolution of the Big Bang
singularity. The Big Bang is in a sense a shrinking way of space, but the thing is that
particles and forces are not affected by that shrinking. They're still obeying equations as
if they were in an extended three-dimensional space. So this is a way of resolving the Big
Bang singularity and turning it into a mirror. So I was going to tell you about explaining the
geometry of the universe, but I think that's too long. I want to talk a little bit about
the most exciting and most recent development in this hypothesis. And so this is addressing
the very fundamental dilemma which occurs in coupling quantum fields to gravity.
Okay, so we know that in order to describe the laws of fundamental physics, we have to use
quantum fields. This is an extremely successful technique and it's the basis for the standard
model. Everything is described by quantum fields in the standard model. However, these quantum fields
look like the right-hand picture in the vacuum. And this is just a consequence of the Heisenberg
Uncertainty principle. You might want to set a field to zero and just say there's no electric
or magnetic field in space, but this is inconsistent with quantum mechanics. Why? Because the magnetic
field is like a coordinate of a particle, x, and the electric field is like the velocity
of a particle or its momentum. And the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle says that either you measure
x or you measure p, you can't measure both. You can't set the position of particle to zero
and its momentum to zero at the same time. You can do one or the other. And so what happens in
the quantum vacuum, you might say, okay, let's have zero electric field, but then you've got infinite
magnetic field. You might say, okay, zero magnetic field, but then you've got infinite electric field.
So the compromise which happens in the vacuum is that neither the electric nor the magnetic
fields are zero. They're both oscillating with what is called zero-point fluctuations.
So the vacuum is full of these fluctuations, which are pictured in the right-hand side.
And these are all the fields in the standard model. The electron fields, the photon fields,
the strong force, the weak force, everything is sort of going crazy in the vacuum. I say going
crazy advisedly because there's infinite energy in these oscillations. This is a very deep paradox
about trying to couple quantum fields to gravity. Now, not only do you get infinite energy in the
vacuum, as I mentioned, gravity detects all energy. And in particular, it's very hard to stop gravity
sealing all this energy in the vacuum. So you led to this immediate paradox that gravity
doesn't, you know, is coupling to an infinity. And cosmology doesn't really make any sense.
So people cheat in various ways. They subtract that infinity in certain ways. But there's a
further problem, which is that these zero-point fluctuations in the vacuum spoil this beautiful
local scale symmetry of the Maxwell and Dirac theory, which we needed in order to make sense of the
Big Bang Singularity. So these vacuum fluctuations seem to prevent us describing the Big Bang
Singularity as a mirror. So what we have done recently, very recently, is we discovered an
entirely new mechanism, A, for cancelling the energy in the vacuum, B, for restoring the symmetry
of Maxwell and Dirac, the local scale symmetry. And we found we can do that in a very unique way.
We call them dimension zero fields. They're rather peculiar fields. They do not have any particles.
They merely exist, if you like, in the vacuum. So all they do is sit there and cancel out these
various diseases in the vacuum. Okay, so it's, again, extremely minimal addition to the standard
model. It's very unique. Their properties are uniquely defined. And then rather miraculously,
these same extra ingredient, the same extra ingredient in the vacuum, turns out to explain
the origin of the density variations. And so this is now rather technical. I'm going to leak to a
formula, which I'm not going to justify. But this formula is a direct consequence of the assumptions
I've laid out. It says that the power spectrum in the early universe, that's this curly P thing,
as a function of wavelength, is given by these numerical factors, which are just a consequence
of relativity quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, various numbers here, C beta, this alpha
y, alpha two and alpha three are the strong, weak, and electromagnetic coupling constants,
as measured in the laboratory. Okay, so roughly speaking, you could say that this is
given by the fine structure constant. But it's for the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.
So there, these numbers are all a consequence of the standard model, right? All these funny
fractions are direct consequence of the number of particles of various charges and types in the
standard model. So these are all standard model, this number of effective degrees of freedom,
this is basically the number of particles in the standard model. So these numbers are just,
you know, inescapable consequences of the standard model. This is the red, this is the red tilt.
You see this power of the fluctuations as a function of wavelength is growing with wavelength,
like lambda to this small power. And this small power turns out to be 0.04,
which is what we observe in the cosmic microwave sky. Okay, so there is this rather magical formula
that comes out of those assumptions. It turns out, and this may be a coincidence, but it's a very
tempting one. Turns out that this formula matches both the amplitude and the red tilt.
So this number gives you roughly 10 to the minus five. Within a factor of two, it matches the
observations. The red tilt, it predicts is 0.042, using the certain measurements of the strong
coupling constant. And the observed number from the Planck satellite is 0.041. So this is very
tantalizing. All I would say at this point is that I think very few cosmologists are, except us,
are convinced by this. Yet, I'm going around, Latham's going around giving talks, people are
challenging us in various ways. If only you could do the calculation this way or that way or check
this or check that, we might believe you. That's very important that we are checked and that we
really present a full-blown calculation to satisfy everyone. And there are various
assumptions we've made. They are always the simplest conceivable assumption, but there are
some assumptions in this result. If this turns out to be theoretically safe, no one points out a
problem with it. If the observations, as they improve, confirm this scaling, extends to even
smaller wavelengths, then this will be the explanation. And cosmology will be unified.
So just to close on this, what I've put forward here is the prospect, at least,
of an extremely unified picture. There is just the standard model and gravity,
perhaps with a few little additions in the vacuum, but no extra particles, no extra forces.
And maybe we are actually very close to understand all the physical laws governing the universe
and how they describe the Big Bang itself. If this is true, there are many, many other
consequences. It leads to a new picture of black holes, which resolves the black hole
information paradox. It will lead to many other predictions because it's so constrained,
this picture. And there's no wiggle room. I mean, either this picture is right or it's wrong.
So we'll see. Here are some references of papers on this. There are other papers on the archive

of the terms of service. Now, a direct mailing list ensures that I have an untrammeled communication
with you. Plus, soon I'll be releasing a one page PDF of my top 10 toes. It's not as
Quentin Tarantino as it sounds like. Secondly, if you haven't subscribed or clicked that like

content to more people like yourself. Plus, it helps out Kurt directly, aka me. I also found
out last year that external links count plenty toward the algorithm, which means that whenever
you share on Twitter, say on Facebook or even on Reddit, etc., it shows YouTube, hey, people are
talking about this content outside of YouTube, which in turn greatly aids the distribution on
YouTube. Thirdly, there's a remarkably active Discord and subreddit for theories of everything
where people explicate toes, they disagree respectfully about theories and build as a
