I'm going to go ahead and
delete the default cube to begin
with. Even an AI deletes the
default cube before adding
things in. Hello everybody and
welcome. Today we're going to
explore using chat GPT in order
to write some Python code for
Blender for us now I've tried
it in the background and I've
been absolutely amazed. But one
warning here. It's not
consistent. If you want to
go ahead and type it in the
background. It's just a
simple form. Forward slash
chat. Okay, so let's just try
something straight away. Let's
stack five cubes on top of
each other in Blender using
Python. That's very badly
worded. Let's just roll with
it. I'm not going to correct
typos either. It seems to be
absolutely fine with that. Now
it is very, very busy at the
moment. But if you want to
do something like this. It's
just overloaded at the moment
at which point I'm going to
have to stop the video and
wait until it's quieter. Oh,
here we go. It's telling me
what it's going to do, and it's
also used a for loop. Okay,
this is brilliant because
before when I was trying it, it
wouldn't use a for loop
initially. So let's just go and
take this. Okay, there's a
copy code button I should have
learned by now, and let's
run that code. Okay, so that
doesn't work. Did it? This is
one of the things about GPT. It
can end up sounding very
confident. I mean, it's given
us this here. We run through
this code will probably work
out why it's not there. Move
the other cubes above the first
cube. Interesting. It's only
done one for this. There are
other cubes there by the
looks of things, but where
they've gone. Who knows? Let's
delete everything out of our
scene again. And let's just
try something else. Let's clear
down what we've got here
actually so we can reset the
thread so it won't remember
anything from before using
Python right a script. I will
to be able to type one day a
script to stack four cubes on
top of each other in blender.
Let's see how it handles this.
Delete the default cube to begin
with. Even an AI deletes the
default cube before adding
things in. Now this is a very
linear script. I would not
write something like this
unless I was really, really
testing something very specific.
Cube not found, of course.
Let's let's just get rid of that
go file new general. So it's
assumed that there's something
in the scene, which is actually
quite a clever thing for it to
do. I've not asked it to delete
the cube, which is, you know,
maybe a bit backwards because I
haven't asked it to do any of
that. But there we go. We've got
four cubes that's on top of
one another. One of the great
things about this is we can
start adding to it. Add a monkey
to the top. Now is it aware of
Suzanne the monkey? Use the
following code so it's built
upon its previous stuff. Add
the second cube. Now one thing
I have noticed here is if this
gets too long, then we're going
to end up with it just pausing
and stopping. So I can see
straight away that's going to
add it on top. Absolutely
fine. I'm not going to actually
paste that in. What I'm going to
do is, um, can you add loops
because I wouldn't add it in,
add it in, add it in. I would
actually loop around those
cubes. Let's see if it does
that. It's also deleting default
cube, which you can't do, of
course, the second time round.
So I'm going to delete that,
delete everything from the scene,
add in the cube. There we go.
So here it goes. Oh, it's
split it out. So here's our loop
to add the monkey. Oh, it's
separated out. Oh, that is
interesting. Okay, well, let's
see if this new script works.
And this is great. You know, I
haven't had to train it or tell
it anything about the blender
API. And there we go. We've got
Suzanne on top of four cubes.
Okay, so that's pretty
straightforward. How far can
we push this? Well, I've tried
a couple of things. Sometimes
they work. Sometimes they don't.
I'm going to delete everything
but that bottom cube, build a
Mayan pyramid. This is actually
one that I've done some work on
myself in an introduction to
Python course I'm working on at
the moment is building a Mayan
pyramid. Let's see how the AI
handles it going to be specific
here. And sometimes you have to
massage the language that you
use to build a script to
build a sorry, write a script
build a Mayan pyramid out of
cubes. Now the first time I ran
this, it worked absolutely
perfectly. The second time I
ran it, it failed miserably. This
is interesting. It's looping
around. This is completely
different code. If this doesn't
work, by the way, because I am
just going to copy and paste it
in. If this doesn't work, I'll
show you a screenshot of the
code as I was playing around
with it before. Okay, that's an
interesting interpretation of it.
It kind of works. We can see
that it's building it out of
cubes and then adjusting the
cubes widths and heights to try
and fit it in. That didn't work.
Let's just blank this out the
way and say, so write a script
to build a Mayan period from
this. This is the only primitive
in Blender. That should have said
primitives, but there we go. So
it's just giving us instructions.
Okay, that's writing a script
rather than code. So I need to be
more specific. Okay, so this is
great. This is giving us an
actual script is in how to
giving us materials. I didn't
ask it to do that. Oh, wow.
That is impressive. You see, it's
a lot of extra stuff here. I
don't really want to add materials
at the moment, although it seems
like it can do that. It's set to
diffuse color and specular
intensity. So this isn't a material
in the same way that you'd usually
set up a material using a node
graph. This is just setting it
manually. It's looking like it's
setting it to a mid level gray
and then applying the material.
That's kind of cool. It's
separated it out. Let's try
it. This is what it did the
first time I ever tried it, and
it's not done it since. And that's
important to realize that if you
copy exactly what I'm doing, you're
going to get a different result.
So build a castle
out of cubes.
This is absolutely
nuts. Oh, no, it's frozen. I
hate it when it freezes like that.
That means it's just run out.
You can
you put this
all in one script.
Oh, please work.
Oh, look like a Myron pyramid
and a castle. Okay, it's remembered
the stuff from before.
I'm not sure whether this is going to
work. It's probably going to stop
typing everything out.
Yep, there we go. Oh, no, no, no, no,
with two walls and a Myron pyramid
in your blend of sea. Well, let's
just give it a go. Let's see what it ends up
looking like. Let's get rid of
everything here. Get rid of everything
here. Are we still deleting the default
cube? I have no idea.
No, we're not. That's fine. Let's
decided not to do that anymore. And
we end up with this. Yeah.
This is not a great demonstration
of
it working. That's fine. Let's
try something completely new. Let's go
to the menu, reset the thread.
Okay, so I'm not going to play around with
Myron pyramid anymore, but we'll put up
it here the first time I ever tried it. It was
successful. And this is one of the
things AI is not coming
for our jobs at the moment.
It will eventually reach a point where it
is very, very good. At that
point, what we're able to do as
artists or developers is
use it to help us use it
to explore ideas really quickly.
Ultimately, it's
very good at spewing out rubbish,
but looks
good rubbish. And that's one of the things
that's going to trip you up. So
let's try something completely new here.
Let's write a blender
script. And what do we want
to do to
create stonehenge
out of cubes?
Now, obviously it knows what a
Myron pyramid is, so I'm guessing it's going
to know what stonehenge
is. And this is one of the
things we can just explore ideas.
And I would say that looking at
code that I've written
at code that it's produced, it does
it in a very dumb way. It may
work. It may not work.
And it's just a matter of trying.
I have seen it come out with
a very interesting way
of actually
approaching a problem, which is great
because it means that I'm also learning
because it has produced something that does
indeed work. Okay, so in front
of us here we have what the Myron pyramid
did the first time around. So a couple of things
that is really interesting
and certainly not the way that I would
approach this code. I'd probably
not have the bpy.obstopmesh.primitive
I would make this
much more readable. I mean it is quite
readable at the moment because it's very short
but this was an incredible
just approach and I didn't delete the default
cube or anything. You can see it got it
straight away. I wish I'd recorded
what the prompt was. I wasn't
thinking about this when I was just exploring it.
In fact, I wish I even
I was recording at the time because I got
really excited when it nailed this first time.
But anyway, so you can see here
it actually made some really concise code
and I think it failed
on this scene to update at the end
or something along those lines. So it can do
some really useful stuff but sometimes it does it in a different way
and I'll show you. Let's have a look
at what it's done here. Oh, oh,
ouch. Okay,
it's made an array of positions.
That's not what it did when I tried this
before. It actually used a math library.
It drew a circle and placed
the pillars and stuff
on the circle. But let's see what
it's created. I mean, ultimately
it's created this big block here. Let's
get rid of that. So this is what
its interpretation of Stonehenge
is. It's wrong.
That isn't Stonehenge.
Let's just, for argument's
sake, say
that is close
but doesn't look like Stonehenge.
It needs to be circular.
Ah, here we go. This looks
a bit more promising. I'm not going to say
it's going to work because who knows what
it's going to create. Let's just clear our
scene out while we're waiting for it to write
our code for us. And
boom, let's just run it.
Okay, interesting.
Let's get rid of that. It's made there.
Okay, you see, it's got an idea of what's
going on. And when I tried this
before, I tried it with things like, oh, could you
make the Stonehenge
a bit more irregular?
And if I got footage of that, I'll pop that up on
the screen. I tried to massage it
to get it to the point at which point I could
have just made it myself in half
the time. So one of the things
that I did have quite
a bit of success with was writing
some helper code. So
let's clear everything down.
And again, I should really put this in a buffer.
I'm going to write a script
to select
every object in Blender or something along
those lines. So if I have a look
at my objects here, they
are all named cube, right?
All of these stem from a cube that's
been manipulated. So I've
asked it to write a script to select
all mesh objects. So I'm being specific
about what type of object in
Blender with
names containing the word cube.
Now, this is something that I have done in the
past. So I'll be interested to see how it
approaches it. And what we'll also do
here is add in
a point map just over here.
Let's add in a camera as well.
It doesn't matter what they're pointing at. It's just
so we've got something else in our scene so we can
make sure it is only selecting the things
that we want it to. Okay, let's
run that. So this is interesting. It's
approaching it from a scene level. So
we see here, bpy.context.scene.
I would typically approach this
I suppose that is a quite a neat
way of doing it. If I was going to do selecting
all types, though, I'd probably
go to bpy.data.objects
if the type
equals mesh, that's correct.
The cube is in the object's name
and said it's true. Nice. So the other
thing that we're going to add in really
quickly is add in an icosphere
just here so we know it is only selecting
objects that aren't named
cube. Okay, let's copy that. Go to
our code and
paste that in. Make sure nothing
is selected and run our script.
Look at that. That is awesome.
The only thing that this is done that you
now need to work out is make
sure that this is
not the active selected because that's going to
do stuff to that icosphere.
Make sure
one of those objects is the active
selected. Now, of course,
this time round, one of the things I've
not done,
I've not asked it and it knows
that it requires Python code.
That's important.
Let's just see if that works.
Copy code, paste it in.
Yes.
Yes, now one of our objects is the active
selected. Perfect. So this
is how it can really help by making
some helper code for you or
just as I say, exploring different things.
The important thing is that AI
is not coming after us yet, but
we can use it to support
what we're doing to help
us and aid us in producing better
work more quickly, which is
brilliant. Wow. So this is
absolutely amazing. I love
this sort of stuff and it being developed,
whether it's creating images for
us or writing code for us, I think this
is a great help at all. Now, if you try
this yourself, I'd love to see what you end up creating.
So do share that with me. And
if you want to learn about Python in Blender
in a bit more structured manner, then
check out these videos here. I'll see
you in the next one.
