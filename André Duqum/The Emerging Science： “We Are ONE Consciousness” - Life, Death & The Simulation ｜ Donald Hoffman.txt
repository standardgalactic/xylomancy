We have assumed in science for hundreds of years that space-time is fundamental reality.
In the last ten years, for the first time, scientists have taken off the space-time headset.
What are we going to find?
So I should be very, very clear on this point.
Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, and when I say that space-time isn't fundamental,
objects and space-time are fundamental, that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.
What I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't see reality as it is.
This theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software outside of our space-time headset.
Once you know the software, you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.
So you believe we're living in a simulation of sorts?
I think that we just have to bite the bullet and say,
no matter how smart and mathematically precise you are,
it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond.
And I think as a scientist, it's critical for me to actually spend time in utter silence.
That's where the true new creativity comes from.
What we know is one perspective out of an infinite number of perspectives,
but that's who you are.
What you are transcends any description,
and that's how the infinite comes to know itself.
Don, so good to have you back.
Thank you, Andre. Thanks for having me back.
I thought we could start with giving maybe a 10-minute overview,
kind of a high-level view of both your work,
our conversation last time, which I absolutely loved and our audience loved.
And then we can dive in deeper into some new terrain here on this conversation today,
which I'm very much looking forward to.
So starting with how fitness beats truth,
and how the chance that evolution has shaped sensory systems to see objective reality
is precisely zero in the work that you share.
Could you elaborate on that a little bit in terms of how evolution shapes our sensory systems
to be able to navigate it effectively for survival purposes,
but not to see reality as it is objectively?
Right. So Darwin's theory is very clear that evolution shapes sensory systems
to guide adaptive behavior.
And that's true. According to Darwin's theory, that is in fact true.
Most of us think intuitively that to do that, evolution must shape us to see the truth,
because clearly, if you see the truth, that will be much more adaptive than if you don't see the
truth. So to guide adaptive behavior, evolution must also shape us to see the truth.
And it turns out that that extra assumption, which isn't in Darwin's theory,
shouldn't be in Darwin's theory. Now, the mathematics of it is very, very simple.
The payoff functions that guide evolution.
Like if you play a game, you have payoffs. If you make certain moves on the board game,
or in a video game, you get a certain number of points. And if you get enough points,
you can get to the next level of the game. If you don't get enough points in time, you die,
and so forth. Same thing like in evolution. There's evolutionary game theory.
You have payoffs that guide adaptive evolution. And what happens with those payoffs, they're
basically not telling you whether you go to the next level of the game, but whether your
genes, your offspring, go to the next level of the game. So when you analyze those fitness payoffs
and ask, do those fitness payoffs contain information about the true structure of
objective reality? If they're going to shape you, if the payoff functions that guide evolution
are going to shape your sensory systems for you to see the truth,
then they have to know a little bit about the truth themselves, or they can't shape you.
And what we've proven, and this is, again, work with not just me, but Shaytan Prakash,
Manish Singh, Robert Prentner, and Brian Marion, and Justin Marks, a number of other people,
not just me. But what we've shown is in a number of ways that the payoff functions
basically don't have the information, almost surely don't have the information about the
structure of the world. So you can actually prove the probability is precisely zero that
any payoff function has that information, and therefore it's precisely zero probability that
we've been shaped to see reality as it is. Now, I should mention just two quick objections that
people have about this. One is, I've shot myself in the foot, logically. I've used evolutionary
game theory, which is supposed to capture Darwin's theory of evolution. It's the mathematics of
Darwin's theory. And I've used it to actually show that certain basic concepts in Darwin's theory,
real physical animals competing for real physical resources in a real space and time.
I'm saying that all of that space and time aren't fundamental. We're not seeing reality as it is.
Objects in space, time are just an illusion or a headset. So the argument from philosophers,
some philosophers have been, well, Hoffman, unfortunately, shot himself in the foot,
logically. He's used evolutionary game theory mathematics to show that the very concepts
that were gave rise to evolutionary game theory aren't true. So either the math faithfully
represents Darwin's ideas, it captures it, and is a good representation of those ideas,
or it's not. If it's not, Hoffman couldn't use it for what he's using it for. And if it does,
if it is a good faithful representation of Darwin's central ideas, then it couldn't possibly
contradict them. So in either way, Hoffman is messed up and his team. And the answer is this
fundamentally misunderstands the nature of scientific theories.
Every theory makes assumptions. There are the miracles of the theory. And then it says,
if you grant me those assumptions, I'll then prove all this or explain all this other wonderful
stuff. But it never explains its assumptions. And you can get a new theory, a deeper theory that
explains those assumptions, but it'll have its own new assumptions, ad infinitum. So every theory
has, if it's good enough, has a scope. But every theory, no matter how good it is,
has its limits. If none else, its assumptions are showing you what its limits are.
So the only question is, when you have a mathematical representation of the theory,
is the mathematics, if it's a good theory, the mathematics will help you explore the scope.
That's new. But if it's a great theory, the mathematics will actually show you precisely
what the limits are. And in case of Einstein's theory of spacetime, for example, his mathematics is
of course fantastic and GPS and everything else is based on Einstein's math. So wonderful scope.
But his theory also, the same mathematics that captures his theory and shows its scope,
also tells us its limits. And the limits are, in Einstein's case, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
Spacetime ceases to have any operational meaning. 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, 10 to the minus
43 seconds. And so here we have the case where the mathematics that Einstein came up with
is the very mathematics that comes back and says, your fundamental concept of space and time fail
at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So that's how science,
good science, really works. The mathematics that's intended to capture
the fundamental concepts of your theory, if it's great mathematics and a great theory,
will come back and show you exactly what the limits are of those fundamental concepts.
So that's not self-refutation. In fact, that's why science is so powerful when we just use informal
discussion and, you know, talking about ideas over beer and so forth. That's one thing.
But you can never find out the limit of your ideas and the limits of your theories when you have
just an informal theory. And as a result, it's easy to become dogmatic and to think that you're
getting close to a theory of everything that I know the truth and you don't and so forth.
What science does is it puts a big dose of humility in there. Even a big theory like Einstein's
Theory of Spacetime, it tells you that theory is great and it stops at 10 to the minus 33
centimeters game over. So you need a new concept. So that's, so it's an anti-dogmatic kind of thing.
So that's sort of just a little, the kind of pushback I've gotten on this. And you can see why
would be some strong pushback because what I'm saying is very, very uncomfortable that we don't
see reality as it is. Yeah. And we'll circle back to the value of discovering the limits
of different theories because I'm excited to dive into that to continue to, you know,
put a bow on the high level overview of this work. That understanding that you just shared
in conjunction with local realism being proof false leads us to explore the headset analogy.
Yes. And so, you know, the Nobel Prize for local realism being proved false explains how
objects in spacetime cease to exist when they're not perceived. Like they get rendered on the fly
when they're perceived. Why does that become an important reflection when we start to dismantle
this notion that reality is as it seems? Well, again, I should say that your local realism is
false. The Nobel Prize was a granted for it for that experimental verification. There are some who
still want to maintain some kind of realism through multiverse kinds of explanations and so forth.
I think that we just have to bite the bullet and say, space and time aren't fundamental.
Yeah. And the properties of objects in space and time aren't fundamental.
So that's the direction I'm going by. I just want to point out that there are very,
very bright physicists who would disagree. Now, the theory of evolution of natural selection
and my work on that is in some sense, it suggests that spacetime is an interface, right? So it does,
it strongly suggests that what evolution gave us was not a window on the truth,
but a headset that lets us play the game of life. And so that's why I think it does fit in with
the modern results in physics. I think it's a very reasonable interpretation of modern quantum
theory and it's actually part of, for example, a big interpretation, the so-called cubism
interpretation of quantum theory that Chris Fuchs and others are espousing, that the quantum
state is just the observer's statement of the degrees of belief of what they will experience
if they make certain kinds of observations. And it's not, quantum states are not descriptions
of objective reality. They're descriptions of your degrees of subjective belief.
So I think that that fits very, very well with the work I'm saying. So here's a case where physics,
this interpretation of physics, the Cubist interpretation of physics, the non-local realist
interpretation of quantum physics works very, very well with what evolution is suggesting,
that we evolve not to see the truth, but to have a headset. So yeah, I think that the two
actually dovetail quite well. Truth to be hidden, but allowing us to control
it in a way that we need. That's exactly right. And I should mention that
since the last time we talked, there has been a big push by the European Research Council,
the ERC. They have a 10 million euro new initiative for finding that there are these
new structures outside of spacetime. Like the Amplituhedron? Like the Amplituhedron, right,
that's right. So they're called positive geometries. And so it's just started?
Is that a cosmological polytope? Is that correct?
That's right. That's right. An associahedron and so forth. So there are these positive
geometries and they could have billions of dimensions. Spacetime has four, maybe 11 in
string theory or something like that. But they could have billions of dimensions. In other words,
our headset is pretty cheap. It's a really, really low dimensional, we got the cheap model.
The high energy theoretical physicists are now looking at structures
like the Amplituhedron, in which one of the parameters is the dimension of your spacetime.
So in our case, M equals 4. M is the parameter. And ours is 4. But they could have a billion.
M could be any number. M is one of the smaller numbers you could have. So that's already a
parameter in the positive geometries that your headset, your spacetime could be as many
dimensions as you want. And we have about as cheap as one as you could get away with.
So instead of us having a theory of everything, we have a theory just of a trivial headset.
So just refining again, the understanding that objects cease to exist in the form we think they
do when they're not received. This goes for the chair that you're sitting on, the moon, any object
that the quantum theory works at all scales, then this would apply to that at all scales.
Can you just share a little bit more about the headset analogy and how that helps us kind of
wrap our head around things exist in objective reality in a way that is analogous like we
explored to last time, like a computer where there's gates of electricity moving. But the display
of the screen is set to hide the truth of reality so we can control it in a way that is useful.
Because otherwise if we didn't have the display of a computer screen, like how would we actually
effectively navigate it? So could you elaborate on that a little bit more so we can wrap our
head around that? That's right. So an obvious question is if we don't see the truth and what
has evolution done? How does it allow us to survive when we're ignorant of what reality is?
But if you think about it, it actually makes a lot of sense. If you have someone,
say Grand Theft Auto, and it is a virtual reality version of Grand Theft Auto in multiplayer,
and there's some supercomputer somewhere that's running it. But you don't see that
supercomputer, you don't need any about the software and so forth. All I know is I've got
a steering wheel in front of me, I've got a dashboard, I've got a gas pedal and so forth.
And I can see over to my right, I can see a green Ferrari or something like that that I'm racing
against. Well, of course, if you looked inside the supercomputer, there's no green Ferrari
anywhere inside the supercomputer. And there's no steering wheel and none of that. The reality
that I'm interacting with and what I'm really doing in this metaphor in that reality is toggling
millions of voltages in a precise order. It has to be, you get one toggle wrong and the thing can
crash. So you have to get this precise toggling of millions of voltages. That's what you're really
doing in the reality. But if you had to do that to play the game, if you actually had to go in
there and know what sequence of voltages to put in at what time, good luck. I'm going to win the
game if I'm just turning my steering wheel and slamming on the brakes and the gas and what I'm
going to win the game. So here's the case where it's very, very clear that knowing the reality and
having to interface directly with the reality to play the game is going to make you lose as opposed
to just having a dumb, dumb down user interface that hides the truth but gives you just the
controls you need. So that's sort of the point of view of evolution. From the evolutionary
point of view, Darwin's idea then is basically that evolution shaped us with sensory systems
that hide all the truth that we don't need and all the gory details. Just give us the levers
that we need to control reality without actually knowing what those levers do. So because if you
all the stuff that you know, you're going to have to pay for more energy for all the neurons
you're going to need to store that information to understand that stuff. It's just too expensive.
So that's sort of an intuition where it starts to make it seem not so much crazy, but of course,
of course, you don't want to see the truth. It's just too complicated.
So this starts to, I think, be a little destabilizing for some people when you say we're
living in a matrix simulation, reality isn't real. And so this understanding that this headset,
this our sensory system allows us to navigate the game of life, like the game in GTA 6 or
whatever that comes out there. If we have like a VR headset, like the Apple headset will allow
us to navigate and play in there, for example. And that space time is a very limited scope of
reality. And within that limited scope of reality, we are perceiving less than 0.1% of the electromagnetic
spectrum that we can see with visible light. The sensory experience of life is extremely
limited to the vastness of what existence actually is. That's right. And even the very notion of
the electromagnetic spectrum itself is an artifact of the headset. It's not a deep insight
into the reality. So when we talk about that, we're using headset language is not the truth.
But even in the headset, we have hints inside the headset, even the part that we see inside
the headset is trivial compared to what's out there. So you believe we're living in a simulation
of sorts. Is that right? Yeah, I would say that this is, that space time is not fundamental
objective reality. And therefore, something else is. And so I should be careful though,
and say when most people talk about simulation theory, like Nick Bostrom and people in that camp,
their point of view is very, very different from mine. And I should be very, very clear about
the difference and also the similarities. So the similarities are that what you see around you is
not the truth. It's in some sense, a simulation or a headset. But what Nick and Bostrom and others
think is that space time and physicalist ideas are still fundamental. And they think that computer
programs properly programmed can actually create consciousness. So the idea is that there's some
computer programmer in a different world that has created this simulation and the and the
the simulation is sophisticated enough that the algorithms are actually creating creatures like
us with consciousness. But it's consciousness that's emerging from the computational prowess
of the programmer and the and the power of the computer. Of course, then the possibility is
that that programmer and their computer is, in fact, just a simulation from a deeper programmer
and so forth, all the many, many levels of that. And, you know, but at the bottom,
the bottom level is presumably again, a physical space time
programmer in a world that's physical and space time. And so the idea is so they're making two
assumptions that space time physics is fundamental. And second, that properly programmed computers
can create consciousness. And I'm disagreeing with both points. So the two critical points of
their simulation hypothesis, I think are false. I think there's no evidence
in any theory of how computer programs could create consciousness. I'll put it this way.
There's not a single theory out there right now. And there have been lots of attempts
that says that consciousness is created by some kind of algorithm, some kind of computational
process, some kind of neural network that can that none of those theories can explain even one
specific conscious experience. When you look at all the theories that are out there and they've
been at this for decades. And many of these people are my friends and they're brilliant people.
But what I always ask them when I speak at conferences, they say, okay, we can experience
roughly a trillion specific conscious experiences. Taste of garlic, smell of chocolate, the sound
of a trumpet, there's about a trillion things that we experienced should be shooting fish and
a barrel to pick one and give us a theory and say how this computational process must be the
taste of mint. So how many of you guys got how many have you done zero? And that's the way it's
been and that's the way it's going to be. So, so there's a lot of talk about these computational
approaches and or neuro biological approaches for for coming with conscious experiences.
And there's not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain zero.
And I predict that that's going to continue because it's not possible in principle to do that.
So, so I disagree with the simulation theorists that are saying that your consciousness is due to
some program or writing up a program that created your conscience. Show me the beef. Yeah, there's
nothing there. There's all sorts of ideas and hand waves. But I have not seen anybody plop down and say
here is for example, an integrated information theory. Here is the causal matrix and by end
matrix and must be 5000. And these are the 5000 by 5000. And these are the exact numbers that
must be in the matrix for this to be the taste of mint. Nothing. Right. And if you think about it,
how in the world could a 5000 by 5000 matrix of numbers be the taste of mint? You've got some
explaining to do. So, so, so that's where I disagree on two things, right? The idea that
spacetime is fundamental and that computational processes or neural processes could create
conscious experiences. And I'll just mention, when you when I give up local realism,
and when I say that spacetime isn't fundamental objects and spacetime are fundamental,
that means neurons don't exist when they're not perceived. That means none of my behavior
is caused by neural activity. Now, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, and I think we need
more money for, for neuroscience, not less. So, so let me be very, very clear. I am not
denigrating neuroscience research. I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. I love that research and we,
but it's going to be much harder than we thought. The 86 billion neurons of the brain and roughly
the same number of glial cells are complicated. But they're trivial. They're just a headset
projection of the real thing that's behind them outside of spacetime. And so, neuroscience is
going to have to reverse engineer the 86 billion neurons and, and look at the much more complicated
reality behind that. So, so I, that's why I say we need more money for neuroscience,
not less. And we're going to have to up our game because we haven't actually started the hard work
yet in neuroscience. So, let's just lay the foundation to for, for people that start to
explore the hard problem of consciousness of why any collection of matter from the
materialist view would have an experience of itself is very baffling. And so, when you look
at consciousness in the many different theories of how it could come to be, there is a materialist
view, which is like you just explained, which is along, you know, analogous the understanding
that spacetime is real. And after a certain amount of unconscious complexity in your neuronal
structure, consciousness starts to appear as you turn that dial forward. Now we're exploring a
little bit more of a originally thought of as panpsychist view, which is the understanding
that consciousness is actually fundamental. Could you explain the difference between
consciousness being fundamental or panpsychism versus idealism?
Sure. That's right. So, I'm good friends with Philip Goff, who's one of the principal proponents
of the modern panpsychist kind of theory. And so, I'll talk about one specific version of it.
I think that Philip may have thought about it that way, but I think he's not necessarily
committed to this. So, what I'm saying right now, I'm not pinning Philip with this, okay. But one
kind of panpsychism takes spacetime as fundamental. And it says that in addition to these elementary
particles, the leptons, bosons, and quarks of the standard model of physics. So, we have these
fundamental particles and their physical properties. In addition, let's just posit that these bosons,
leptons, and quarks also have in addition a fundamental unit of consciousness. So that they,
and in some sense, the consciousness is what is the reality behind the mathematics.
And that certainly is interesting, but there's a couple problems with it. First is,
why should we assume that the laws of consciousness are tied to the laws of our particular headset?
This is just the M equals 4 version of a projection of something that's much more complicated.
It fails to understand how trivial spacetime is. Spacetime is just a trivial headset. And so,
if we're going to pin our theory of consciousness such that the equations of that little headset
are in some sense dictating how these consciousnesses interact, that's just way too limiting.
We have to think outside of that box. And second, it actually does no work.
As a scientist, I would like, I mean, philosophy is important, and so I'm not
denigrating philosophy, but as a scientist, I would like my theory of consciousness to
actually do some work for me. Not just to say, the laws of physics, you can leave them alone,
nothing to see here, but we can tag on consciousness. I'm very, very unhappy with that.
I would like a theory of consciousness that shows me where the laws of physics come out
as a special case of the more general laws of consciousness. So, I would like to show that
the headset is a trivial headset, and consciousness is the more fundamental. So, you can see,
it's a very, very different spirit. Now, having said that, there are many different versions
of panpsychism. So, I could easily imagine, and I may have already influenced Philip in this
direction. We'll see. Panpsychism that's not tied to spacetime. In that case, as a scientist,
I still want, then, fundamental mathematical principles. I want this partly because as a
scientist, here's the attitude that I think hard-nosed physicalists should have toward this.
They can say, look, in our assumption that spacetime are fundamental, and doing the mathematics of
physics is fundamental, we can explain all this stuff. Your GPS is due to us. The science and
technology that's allowing us to do this podcast is all due to this physical science.
What kind of scientific equipment has come out of your theory of consciousness? Oh, none? Oh,
well. I think that that sort of tells us how important your ideas are vis-a-vis our physical
and what can I say? They've got me, and they've got anybody who says consciousness is fundamental,
and then says, and they say, well, what kind of technology can you give us? What? None. Well, then
either that whole approach is not strong enough, or you haven't done your work. And I think it
is, we haven't done our work. I think the approach is strong enough, but we now, those of us who
take consciousness as fundamental, need to have fundamentally new mathematical theories of consciousness,
consciousness with rigorous mathematics that shows how precisely spacetime comes out as a
projection of this, where we actually get the standard model of particle physics and the
generalization of it, so that we can actually predict new technologies. So that's where I'm
headed. So the panpsychist approach has not at all been taken into direction by philosophers that
could ever lead to brand new mathematics that would lead to new technologies. So that's one
problem I've got with it. The approach that I'm taking is, I call it conscious realism,
but you mentioned idealism. Strictly speaking, what I'm doing is philosophically idealism.
It's probably the closest would be Bernardo Castro's analytical idealism. So yes, it is.
What I'm doing is idealism. Which just so I can understand, like, panpsychist view would be that
consciousness is fundamental. So essentially consciousness, yeah, it's a fundamental constituent
and idealism would be perceiving consciousness as all there is, but projecting down essentially
as like reality is a shadow of innocence. Yeah, the idea that's what we call physical spacetime is
just ideas in the mind. It's just a headset. Ideas in the mind of God. Ideas in the mind of
that's right. Of consciousness. Absolutely. So and the idea would be then that
this is what quantum mechanics is telling us. The fact that local realism is false
means that the moon or whatever you observe has a value of position, momentum and spend and so forth.
When you observe and when you don't observe, you can't assert those things because in fact,
they're not true. And this is quite nice. This is non-contextual realism.
And there's some wonderful work on this, the Coak and Specker Theormus and so forth.
There are cases where you can actually set up these quantum measurements where you can show
a sequence of measurements where you can predict with probability one
what the outcome of an experiment will be. One of the measurements will be
probability one. And you can prove that the mathematics of quantum mechanics entails
that there could not possibly have been a value until you made the measurement.
So these are like knock down, drag out kinds of arguments that non-contextual realism is false.
So all measurements are contextual. And to put that in normal language, it means that in some
sense, the consciousness of the observer, although I shouldn't put that on Chris Fuchs, right?
So I think that he's going to be agnostic about consciousness and all this stuff. He's just saying
whatever quantum mechanics is just describing the degrees of belief of the agent that's making
the measurements. So when I talk about consciousness, I'm not putting that on Chris. That's me.
So now as we start to explore a little bit more beyond the headset,
what role do you feel like evolution could be playing as a projection down from consciousness?
That's a great question. And it does raise the issue that I'm going to be talking about
consciousness beyond space. And strictly speaking, that's an independent hypothesis
from the whole business about evolution, leading us to have evolved a headset. So we have to be
very careful about how the science goes here. In the first step, I'm just taking Darwin's theory
and the mathematics of it and saying, let me just take that as my game. Darwin's theory and the
mathematics of it. What does it tell us about our perceptions? Oh, it's just a headset. It's not the
truth. That's what Darwin's theory entails. Now it's a separate step. Okay, now that Darwin has
told us that we need to look outside of spacetime. But Darwin doesn't tell us what's outside of
spacetime. So when I do the next step and say, okay, I'm going to propose that there's this
social network of conscious agents, I'm leaping way, way beyond Darwin. And there's nothing in
Darwin that says that's the leap you have to take. So I should be very, very clear. Nothing in my work
in evolutionary theory is saying you must go to conscious agents. However, I have to go the other
way. If I'm going to propose conscious agents, the social network, the Twitterverse of conscious
agents as the fundamental reality, then it's my responsibility to show that I can first
project it back into something that I would call spacetime, create a spacetime. And that when I do
that projection, in that spacetime, I would see what looks like nature, red, and tooth and claw
as Darwin predicts. So it's not that Darwin predicts conscious agents. It's rather that Darwin says
there's something beyond spacetime. And then I go, okay, well, what is it? Darwin can't tell me,
I need to make my own leap. So I'm going to propose conscious agents because at least that way I might
be able to understand consciousness. Then okay, then as a scientist, no BS, give me back spacetime,
give me back the standard model of particle physics, every bit of it with new predictions,
and give me back evolution by natural selection. Otherwise, my theory of conscious agents,
you shouldn't pay attention to it at all. So unless I can do that, bye bye. So that's the hard
nose attitude that we have to have for these, an idealist theory of conscious beyond spacetime.
Again, I'm not putting down philosophy. Philosophy is wonderful. And I learn a lot from philosophers.
But I'm talking about science here. Scientists who are idealists have to do this hard work and
give us back a theory of spacetime that gives us new technologies and new insights. So that's what
what I'm up to right now is working with my colleagues. It's a mathematically precise theory
of consciousness. It's think of it as again, like a social network, like the Twitterverse,
there's an infinite number of these conscious agents. And we have a mathematics with some
Markovian so called a Markovian dynamical system. It's trivial to show that it's
computationally universal. So our network of conscious agents can do anything that a neural
network could do. Chat GPT, Gemini, Bard, all these, these all these AI programs that are
based on neural nets, conscious agent networks can do all of that. So our conscious agent nets
only assume that there are agents that have a range of experiences like the taste of chocolate,
the smell of garlic. So that's one of our miracles. Every scientific theory has a miracle. Here's my
miracles. There are conscious experiences. And second miracle is that there are probabilistic
relationships among conscious experiences. That first one though doesn't necessarily
require an assumption, right? So how could you say it's a miracle? Well, most because our conscious
experience is probably the one thing that I sell evident, right? Well, I would agree that
space and time, what we call physics is an extrapolation from our experiences. My experiences
are all I know directly. So I would agree with you on that. But when I say it's a miracle for my
theory, what I'm saying is my theory will not try to explain the origin of conscious experiences.
So it's not sense. It's a miracle. Got it. So it's going and some people might say, well,
that's why I like physicalism, because I'm just going to start off with
the standard model of particle physics. And I don't need to assume the taste of mint and all
these experiences, just the particles and their properties. And I'm going to show you where those
conscious experiences come from, and then I win. And I would say if they could do that,
but as I said, that would be very, very impressive if they could do that. Right now,
they're batting zero. And I predict that they're going to bat zero. But they would have their
own miracle, which is the laws of the standard model of particle physics and the corks and
gluons and bosons and leptons that they... So it's not like they don't have any miracles.
They have their own miracles. It's just not my miracles. So every theory is going to have its
miracles. Now, one thing about taking consciousness as fundamental is that there's a wide variety of
conscious experiences. Right? I said there's a trillion specific ones that we have. So that's,
in some sense, it's assuming a lot. Right? But it's one category of assumption. It's a category
of conscious experiences. And the reason why right now, I think it's a good step as a scientist to
move in that direction is when you look at my good friends and colleagues who are doing the
physicalist theories, they're having to assume all of spacetime physics, the standard model and so
forth. And then when they get to the step of explaining conscious experiences, they can't.
And so what they're effectively having to do is also they have to stipulate the conscious
experiences. They stipulate the physics and they stipulate the conscious experiences. And that's
actually the word that Stephen Pinker used as he describes the global workspace, the global
neuronal workspace theory. He's saying, yeah, it stipulates all the physics, but then it also
has to stipulate the conscious experiences. And so my attitude is, well, if the physicalist theories
are stipulating the conscious experiences as well as the physics, and I'm only stipulating the
conscious experiences, and I'm going to show where the physics comes out, I'm going to explain the
physics, I'm not going to stipulate the physics, I'm going to explain it and hopefully get a deeper
model with new technologies that you couldn't get with spacetime. Then you win. That approach will
win because I've stipulated less than the physicalist theories. So that's why I think I want to go
ahead with this, even though it's a big give to take all these conscious experiences as fundamental.
But what I'm not taking is other things like learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence,
the self, there's all these other things that we would expect to have from a theory of consciousness.
And I'm not assuming those that I'm going to explain. The only thing I'm assuming are the raw
conscious experiences themselves and probabilistic relationships among them. That's all.
That's all I'm giving myself. So it's very, very spare starting point, as spare as I could make it.
It was literally the minimal thing that I thought I could get away with. And then
there's no notion of self, learning, memory, intelligence, all that other stuff,
we have to build that. But the fact that it's computationally universal means,
it doesn't mean it's easy, but it means, yeah, we can do it.
So we mentioned a little bit earlier, the amplitude hydrant, which is this joule-shaped
geometric structure that challenges our notion of space and time. How would you explain what that
is to somebody that is not a physicist or mathematician, like in simplistic terms,
what does that represent for the possibility in challenging notions of space and time?
Yeah, it's an interesting short story. I'll tell this short story.
When you try to understand how particles interact in space-time, you might smash
two gluons into each other and four gluons go spraying out. And you want to look at the
probabilities of various kinds of interactions that particles can have. They call them scattering
amplitudes, but probabilities of interactions. When you do the mathematics in space-time using
quantum field theory, the math is very difficult. That little two in, four gluons out,
hundreds of pages of algebra, hundreds of pages of algebra for one interaction,
millions of terms. And that makes it really hard when you have to look at
millions or even billions of these interactions per second to try to figure out what's the new
stuff. So there was some serious pressure to try to make the mathematics easier. The
experimentalists were saying, come on, guys, you've got to give us something a little bit
easier to work with here on the mathematics. And so some mathematicians in the 80s discovered
they could get it down to 13 pages instead of several hundred pages that were like,
oh, thank you, there's holy smoke down to like 13 or something. And then they guessed a single formula,
like just a few terms. You could write it down by hand. And it was right for that one particular
interaction. And it was like, there's something going on here. There's like some magic going on
here. Maybe it's a one-off. But then they found other examples. And then in 2005, 2006, Ed Whitton
and his postdocs discovered something called, it's now called the BCFW recursion relation,
that allowed them, for many, many kinds of interactions, technically it's called N equals
four super young mills. But anyway, a particular class, they could compute them with this very,
very simple recursive formula that collapsed all this stuff. And some guy named Hodges, then
brilliant physicist in England, said, in one case, in a few cases, it looks like this formula is
putting together pieces of a volume of some object. Maybe there's some general thing here.
And then Neema and his team said, oh, that's an interesting idea. So they went after that.
And in 2014, 2013, they published the archive, but 2014, the actual publication came out. So just
10 years ago, the official publication came out of the amplitude hedron, which confirmed what Hodges
had proposed. But there was some geometric object that BCFW recursion relations were gluing pieces
together to make this object. And that object was encoding in its volumes, the scattering
probabilities. And the structure, it turned out, of this object. The structure was encoding the
probabilities. The volumes are encoding the probabilities. But the structure, like the edges,
the all the edges and so forth, were encoding properties of locality and uniterity, effectively
space time properties, quantum uniterity and space time locality, you know, relativistic
locality. And so, but this was not an object inside space time. And it was actually entirely
beyond space time, and also beyond quantum theory. So some people said, well, yeah,
space time isn't fundamental, but we'll use entanglement, for example, of quantum theory
to boot up space time. And they're saying, no, no, no, no. Space time and quantum theory are
emerging together from something far deeper, such as the amplitude hedron. And then more generally,
these positive geometries. So the amplitude hedron is sort of like the first, but positive
geometries more generally. So the idea is there's, we have assumed in science for hundreds of years
that space time is fundamental reality. In the last 10 years, for the first time,
scientists have taken off the space time headset. And we said, we can look outside space time.
What are we going to find? We're looking outside of space time. The first paper,
in some sense, that was going outside of space time is in say in the last 10 years,
give or take. So we've been looking outside of space time for 10 years. And what do we find?
What do you want? What do you take off? What's the obelisks?
Geometric structures, not a dynamic, it's just sitting there. Here I am.
Big geometric could be millions of dimensions. It could be hundreds of dimensions,
trillions of dimensions. It's just sitting there. And so here, it was very much like
2001 space Odyssey, where the obelisk is there. Yeah. And all the apes are pounding and hooting
and hooting. They know it's important. Yeah. It's clearly and they have no clue, right?
And that's where we are. We've taken off the headset. There's these obelisks sitting there,
smiling at us. Quiet. They're not moving. They're telling us something really,
really important. And we and it's so tantalizing that as I mentioned, the European Research Council
just put out $10 million initiative. It's called the universe plus initiative. February,
they brought together like a hundred mathematicians and high energy theoretical physicists
to launch this whole thing. And we're off to the races. We've taken off the headset. We found
these obelisks. We want to find out who put those obelisks there and why. What is this telling us?
So the race is on. And what I'm proposing is we need a dynamics. Physics always wants something
dynamical. We need a dynamics that will give rise to these obelisks, the positive geometries.
And so that's what I'm working on with this theory of conscious agents. What the paper I'm
working on right now and the paper I published last year is we're taking the theory of conscious
agents in this dynamical system, and we're showing how to get the new objects that the
physicists have found outside of space time for them. So I didn't mention in addition to the
positive geometries, there are combinatorial objects, in particular, something called
decorated permutations that classify these structures, classify the objects. And we've
done that. We've actually mapped our consciousness dynamics onto the decorative permutations.
That's then giving us the that helped us grok how to then mesh our theory of conscious agent
dynamics, the Markov dynamics, with these positive geometries. And the paper we're working
right now, we're planning to actually take, in the simple case, n equals four super young
males to go all the way from consciousness all the way into space time and predict a scattering
amplitude. So the idea, and that was just the first baby step, but the idea is we start with
the theory of consciousness, mathematically precise outside of space time, and show precisely
where these decorated permutations and the positive geometries come from, and then show
how space time and its properties emerge as a trivial projection of this social dynamics of
conscious agents. So that's sort of the big picture of where we're headed.
Okay, there's like four tangents that just spurred off that I want to explore.
There is this Sufi master, actually, that I believe has a quote roughly saying,
this whole universe was made so that God may know himself, the seed wished to know what it was
and what is in it. And so it became a tree. And it seems like structures like these geometric
structures that exist out of space time that we're discovering point to projecting projecting down
into this reality to create almost analogous to like we discover certain crystals or rocks that
earth, for whatever reason, the dynamics create these mathematically precise structures that are
extremely beautiful, that we're looking down projecting down into there are these higher
dimensional structures that are projecting down. And so I'm just curious, what implications do you
feel like is comes about as we start discovering these hired, like obelisks that for some reason
are there, we don't know why. But that, yeah, that again, like we mentioned challenges or notions
of space time, but then also begs the question of what are they doing? How are they there?
Right, right. Well, and first, I should clarify one thing. I mean, I probably sound very excited
about these ideas about conscious agents outside of space time. And I'm playing it up.
Because that's the current research I'm doing. It's a lot of fun. But frankly, it's just a baby
step, right? It's not the truth. I, there is no such thing as a theory of everything. And that
includes Hoffman's theory. So I'm not claiming I've got the final word. I'm just saying that
here's a very interesting, for those of us who think something like consciousness is fundamental,
here is a first scientific theory outside of space time. But it's not the final theory of everything.
And, and I'll be very, very happy when someone comes and overthrows my theory and get something
deeper. But my guess is that the deeper thing will be a much deeper understanding of consciousness
than one that my theory is proposing. So, so humble pies is required, right? This isn't,
I'm not the theory of everything. I'm, it's okay to be excited and be fine. But don't mistake that
for me thinking it's the truth. It's not the truth. It's just an interesting baby step. In terms of,
for example, what you were saying about the suit, what the Sufi master said.
I think something like that is really right. There's a, again, it's a good pointer. Again,
not when I say right, not the truth, but again, a pointer in an interesting direction. I think that,
so I should be very, very clear on this point. This is really critical.
I talked earlier about scientific theories, always making assumptions. And therefore,
there could never be a scientific theory of everything.
That means there's an infinite number of scientific theories that we could create,
because there's an infinite number of deeper and deeper assumptions we could make.
And reality, whatever it is, is transcends even that infinite sequence of scientific theories.
And that's, that's really an important point and it's, and it's coming from a very
simple fact about scientific theories. Every scientific theory must make assumptions.
And it doesn't explain its assumptions. Those are miracles for the scientific theory.
There's no way around it. You cannot give me a scientific theory that doesn't have miracles.
At the starting point, we call them assumptions. That's a very sobering fact about science,
and one that we should really look at closely. It means infinite job security for science,
which is good. But that's also very, very humbling. It means that even if we gave infinite effort,
had a billion Einstein's working for a billion years,
we wouldn't scratch the surface of whatever objective reality is. So when spiritual traditions,
many spiritual traditions have made it very, very clear, like the Tao De Ching says,
the Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao. They're saying something that's
truly, truly important. And that is, all of our concepts
fail ultimately. They're pointers to the reality, but they're not the reality. In the following,
very, very simple sense, the word mint versus the experience of mint.
Of course, the word mint is nothing like the experience of mint. And the word mint doesn't
explain the experience of mint. And it's not a theory of the experience of mint. If you want to
know mint, the experience of mint, you have to taste it yourself. You have to know it firsthand.
And then someone else can say, that is what I mean by the word mint. So you have to
have the experience yourself. And then the words can point to it. This is not BS. This is the way
and this is all of our concepts. The color red, the smell of garlic, the sound of a trumpet,
you have to have the, if you don't have the experience yourself,
good luck me giving it to you by talking. So my words aren't going to do it. And so that's,
so what the spiritual traditions have been saying is extremely important here. It's not just
schmystical nonsense. I'm saying that scientists have to really understand that our scientific,
I'm a scientist. I love scientific theories. They beat hand waves by a long shot. So I'm sort of
impatient with hand waves. Scientific theories are wonderful because they're precise and they
tell you their limits. And so they tell you when that theory is done. That's beautiful. But
many scientists still have the hope that they're going to get the theory of everything.
No chance. There is no theory of everything. So the spiritual traditions are telling us the
right thing when they say any word is a pointer. The same thing is true of scientific theories.
They're all at best pointers, but our pointers in science tell us their limits. The spacetime
pointer stops at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. Thank you. After that, spacetime is not worthwhile.
It doesn't work and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. That's the anti-dogmatic cure that we get from
science that's really, really powerful. So I'm all on board with the spiritual traditions
saying in some sense that whatever reality is, you can only make pointers to it. And even our
scientific theories will only be pointers to it. And they're only pointers to a perspective
on it. So the idea that the infinite one that you were saying from the Sufi master,
that the infinite needs to look at itself from different perspectives, I agree. And maybe what
science does is it gives us rigorous, the most rigorous descriptions we can give pointers from
a perspective. And the fact that we can do technology doesn't mean that we know the truth.
It means that we have a good description of this perspective. And so the match of the scientific
description to a perspective, not the ultimate truth transcends, but the perspective description
getting that right does allow technology. And so that's where we can see most of our theories
are not even right about our perspective. We're just so wrong that we don't even get our perspective
correct. So that's how humbling this is. And words are frustratingly inadequate for describing
these things. And much like what you were saying, it's so puzzling because our words are meant to
communicate our inner experience. And yet our inner experience inherently transcends linguistics.
That's right. And I'm excited to dive also into Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem,
because this points that there are truths that can't be proven. And so we'll dive into that
in a moment. But just any further thoughts on how the limits of language is a very real thing.
And it's a thing on this podcast that we can talk about many different things forever. And yet
you won't have the experience of it until you taste it.
Until you taste it. That's right. And in the spiritual, the big one in spirituality is that
the ultimate unconditioned consciousness transcends any description. You can only know it
by letting go of thought. And actually being face to face no thought with that unconditional
infinite intelligence that you are. Now, for many scientists, that sounds very schmystical.
It sounds very, very, this is so unscientific. It's so, we want rigorous terms that we can
verify and experiments. And what I, my point earlier was, no, this is not different than
what's going on in science at all. All of the basic concepts that we have, how do we know
the taste of mint? If you've never tasted it, I can't. The word is only a pointer.
Space time. If you've never experienced space time, the mathematics is only a pointer. So this
is not something, some deficit of spiritual traditions that they say, well, we're pointing to
this schmystical thing that's infinite intelligence that you are, but no words. And most of my
colleagues in science would go, that's kind of nonsense. We don't need to deal with here in
science. And I'm saying, no, no, that's the kind of nonsense you deal with all the time.
Almost every term that you use is only known by what we call ostensive definition.
Ostensive definition means someone has to point and then give you the word. Like when you're,
when you have a baby, 18 months, and it's time for them to learn some words and mom and dad,
you know, there's a rabbit on the carpet. And at the right age, you can just point and say rabbit.
And, you know, Chris gets it. You know, baby, Chris gets that. Now, when you think about it,
that's a miracle. There's an infinite number of hypotheses that Chris could entertain. It could
be the fur, the texture of the fur, the color. It could be the ear and the left foot. It could be
the tail and the chair behind the rabbit. There's an infinite number. So how is it that all mom and
dad have to do at the right age is to point and say to Chris, rabbit, and Chris gets it.
Often in one or just one or two trials. That's ostensive definition. And that means that Chris
already has to have that experience. And mom and dad don't teach them the experience. They assume
the experience and they give a pointer, which is trivial compared to the experience of the rabbit.
Rabbit is nothing. The word rabbit is just a trivial pointer. And this is how we know
basically everything. Every visual experience that you have, every smell experience you have,
every tactile experience you have, the fact that you get the name, people just tell you,
the experience that you're having that I'm assuming that you're having. We call that, you know,
hot. We call that cold. We call that rough. We call that smooth. We call that satin. Whatever,
you have to have the experience. And that's almost any century experience is all by ostensive
definition. We don't teach people anything. If they don't have the experience, you can't teach them.
So this kind of thing, it's easy for scientists to dismiss the claim that language fails to capture
this deep consciousness that's unconditioned, that that's infinite, and that ultimately
is the core of who you are. That sounds so schmistic to them. And I'm saying, no, no, no,
this is ubiquitous. And all the terms that we know basically are by ostensive definition
from things that transcend the words and can't be reduced to the words. And I should just,
it's humorous, but when you're pointing to the rabbit and saying rabbit at the right age with
Chris, what you don't do is point and say quadruped. You'd be messing up your kid. If you
said quadruped or, you know, a mammal, something like that's just just the wrong thing to do.
So we actually have rules that are wired into us. We know intuitively, you don't have to go to class.
You just know that when you're going to say rabbit, you're not going to say quadruped or
mammal or anything like that. It's reducing it down to its function or parts instead of
what its essence is. That's right. So there, and the kid is also pre-programmed to know
that mom and dad know this intuitively. So they're going to give me what we call the basic level
object category name first, and then they'll maybe give me some superordinate or subordinate
pointers later on. But right now, I'm going to just get the basic level. And so there's,
we're actually wired up with the right way of pointing out. So the pointing that you get in
the spiritual traditions, and these are just pointers, I'm just pointing out that that's
how we learn everything. It's pointing out all the time. This is not some just schmistical,
weird stuff that these people, it's all over the place and it's essential in science.
And I think that the pointing out of things doesn't absolve us of the mystery of what it is,
because oftentimes you give a bird a name, right? You discover a new species or whatever,
and you name it. And it's like, okay, now we know what that is. There is a level of grandiosity,
just labeling something as in that's a rabbit. And okay, yeah, there's just not,
there's not, I just know that rabbits look like that or a tree is just a tree. And you don't get to,
I guess, be surprised by the mystery of what the essence of that thing is, which is
like the one in the many different ancient wisdom traditions that have talked about this
immaterial realm that pre-exists space, time, and the quantum foam from
Kabbalistic origins talking about Ayn Sof, which is literally without end, or Buddhism talking
about emptiness, or Advaita Vedanta talking about this non-dual reality, that the consciousness
extremely vast and differentiating itself into all of these different experiences,
which I find so fascinating. I've heard you talk to how, as humans, we have three channels of color
with red, green, and blue. The Mantis Shrimp has 10, 11, or more channels of color. What is that
experience like? Exactly. No, I agree with all the points that you're making here. And it's really
critical, as you were talking about the spiritual traditions, do tell us that the word is just the
word, and the reality transcends the word. The word is just a pointer. And so they often will
recommend that you spend time letting go of the words. So that's meditation. So if you want to
not be trapped in the trivial world of concepts, which is trivial compared to reality, then spend
time in meditation where you literally let your mind not dwell on the concepts. You just have no,
you let go of any concept. And when you actually look at the, when you walk around in the world,
look at trees, look at the ocean, where you just literally say, my mind can be quiet for a while.
Just no thoughts. I'm just going to be here in thoughtless pure awareness. Then the world comes
alive. And you begin to realize most of the time, you've killed the world. It's deadened. You see the
dead world of your concepts, and you don't see the living world that surrounds you. And I can put this,
so that's what spiritual tradition, I'll put this in scientific language,
base inference. We talk about our prior understandings, our prior probabilities,
Bayesian priors. So you have this prior probability of, for example, maybe
belief in the standard model of particle physics and the particular laws in that and those problems.
That's my, my, my prior. Before that, maybe with Newton, we had Newton's theory of physics and so
forth. That would be our prior. And once you have a prior, once you have the prior probability,
any new data that you get will be interpreted in terms of your prior understanding.
And there's a whole Bayesian inference kind of thing. And you get a posterior distribution,
which is, so given that you have this prior belief, and you get this new data coming in,
then you compute what your posterior distribution will be.
Walking around without concepts, letting go of thought is saying, I need to let go of my prior.
If I don't let go of my prior, I'm condemned to only see my posterior in both funny senses that
you can only see your posterior, both in the technical sense and in this more metaphorical
sense. If you don't let go of your priors, you will only see your posterior. And, and so if you
don't want to just be seeing your own posterior, you want to be open up to novelty, then you actually
have to spend time, I think as a scientist, it's critical for me to actually spend time in, of
course, thought and mathematics and hard notes, no substitute, do your hard work. And then let go
of it completely. Sit there in utter silence. That's where the true new creativity comes from.
And then go back and try to translate it, if you can, into the, the math and symbols that,
that you have. And that way you're not stuck with your priors. You, if you want creativity,
you actually have to get outside your priors altogether. So I, so I would suggest that,
again, there's not some kind of mystical, nasty, terrible, silly stuff that's going on,
you know, in spiritual traditions that, that's anathema to science. I think there's a way to
understand what the spiritual traditions are, are telling us that makes sense from a Bayesian
inference point of view from the science, from the scientists. If you don't let go of your priors,
you're condemned to only see your posterior. So let go of your priors. What does that mean?
Of course, do your homework, but then at some point step back and let go of all your concepts
for a while and see what comes out. Yeah, it really seems like the parable of the blind men
and the elephant where blind men come and, you know, touch the tail of the elephant, think it's
a whips and other touches the leg, thinks it's a tree trunk. Another touches the trunk of the
elephant and thinks it's a, you know, a snake and another touches the belly, thinks it's a wall.
And they're all experiencing parts of something and not understanding the whole of what it is. And
I just find it very interesting to explore the overlap and conciliance of what the cutting-edge
science is saying with the ancient wisdom traditions and philosophy and metaphysics. And
if we can touch all the different parts of that metaphorical elephant to see and talk to each
other about what our experience is of that thing, that it points us closer to the direction of the
experience of what it actually, you know, what it actually is and what reality actually is.
Yes. I think that the idea of the elephant being looked at from different various perspectives
is apt here. And the science gives us rigorous tools to do that palpating of different parts of
the elephant with more precision than we might otherwise palpate it. And when I say that there's
infinite job security in science, I mean, that's really, truly humbling. It means that we, with
all the palpation we've done, we have 0% of the elephant underneath us, 0%. And that's, I honestly
believe that. I think that we've palpated 0% of it. What we know is one perspective out of an
infinite number of perspectives. Not like there's five perspectives and we got one of them. No,
there's an infinite number of different perspectives. And whatever it is, but that's who you are. What
you are transcends any description, an infinite number of descriptions. And so it's truly, truly
a remarkable claim that spiritual traditions are making and that you and I are just avatars.
Andre and Don are avatars being used by an infinite consciousness that transcends an
infinite number of different descriptions and would transcend an infinite
study by science. And it's talking to itself through two different avatars
and looking at itself right now through a particular humble perspective, only a four-dimensional
space-time headset perspective on itself. And it's doing that and who knows how many,
there's an infinite number of these other things going on all the time. But what's interesting
about it as well from a social perspective is once I understand that Andre and Don are just
really the same consciousness talking to itself through two different avatars,
that's the real foundation for social interaction and social justice. Love your neighbor as yourself
is true and right because your neighbor is yourself. It's interesting the infinite
consciousness that we are has chosen to forget itself, to plunge itself into a perspective
so thoroughly that it's lost in the perspective. And it actually views
its other avatars as enemies in some cases and slowly wakes up. And so somehow it's really
important when you look at yourself from a perspective that you really look at yourself
from that perspective, you take it really, really seriously and you get lost in it and
then very, very painfully wake up. And then you realize, oh, as interesting and complicated and
wonderful as that perspective was, I infinitely transcend that. And that's how the infinite
comes to know itself. It's beautiful. And that's why I love talking to you so much too,
is because you're able to navigate both terrains of the scientific understanding,
which is rigorous and the philosophical and inner experience side of things. If consciousness
really is this unifying field, then us as individuals in parentheses, having this individual
experience are much like waves of an ocean. We're not actually separate, but we have the
experience in a certain amount of time, in a certain amount of space that Andre and Don exist,
just like a wave exists in an ocean for a certain amount of time and for a certain amount of space.
And it has its own experience that is unique and unlike any other wave that has probably ever come
before. And after that time and space it inhabited is over, then it joins back the ocean. But the
kicker is that it was never separate from the ocean. In the first place. In the first place.
That's right. But there is value in the ocean, having the wave in us as individuals that are
connected to source or the one kind of losing ourselves, discovering ourselves, waking up,
because that somehow provides a unique nuanced experience and perspective of the one that
otherwise wouldn't have been previously available. I completely agree. I think that's right. And
the one thing that we're trying to do with mathematics that we're working on right now
is to actually take that idea and make it mathematical. Again, the mathematics will always
just be a baby step. But still, to take those ideas that what you're saying is, I think,
been part of the wisdom traditions for millennia, that kind of idea, to turn it into mathematically
precise things. So what we're doing right now, for example, we have with the Markovian dynamics
of conscious agents. And the way the wisdom ideas get cashed out is that the
model, again, it's just a model, but here's what the model says. We can write down dynamics of
this infinite conscious agent. That's so-called stationary dynamics. There is no entropic arrow
of time. So it's a dynamical system, but the entropy is not increasing.
Hmm. Well, if it is, then also,
centropy is increased air is moving in the other direction. What do you say?
I'd have to look for stationary dynamics. That's the technical thing I'd have to ask about.
I'll have to look. Sidebar.
That's right. But the entropy is constant in the stationary dynamics. But it's a theorem
that if I take this dynamics in which there's no entropic arrow of time and I look at it from
any perspective by conditional probability, for example, then the dynamics that I'll see
will be a projected dynamics and that projected dynamics will have an arrow of time. The entropy
will be increasing. So here we are with an entropic arrow of time. The model I'm working on is
there's a consciousness has no entropic arrow of time. It's timeless. And it's also spaceless.
But when I look at it from this perspective, so we're talking about perspectives,
but now we can deal with mathematical precision, we can say when we take this perspective,
then by the math, the mathematics tells us we're going to get an arrow of time. So we will get a
big bang. And, and, and by the way, there's no, it's all one. The consciousness is all one. But
when you get inside of the projection, now all of a sudden there are these artificial boundaries.
So you get what we call predictive processing and Markov blankets and active inference and so
forth. All of this stuff, which is sort of modern state of the art neuroscience kinds of things
that we're looking to and, and other computer science looking at ways of, you know, modeling
thing, all of that breaking into units with Markov blankets, separating things and so forth,
active inference mean predictive processing to maintain our boundaries. All of that is not
an insight into the deep nature of reality. All of that is an artifact of loss of information,
the projection, as is Darwin's theory of natural selection. Nature, red, and tooth, and clock.
What is the fundamental limited resource in evolution? Time. If I don't eat in time, I die.
If I don't mate in time, I don't reproduce. If I don't breathe in time, I die. Time is the fundamental
limited resource. So I love Darwin's theory. Inside space time, talking about biology inside of our
space time, there's no better theory than Darwin's. Having said that wonderful thing about Darwin,
every aspect of his theory is an artifact of the projection from space time. None of it
translates to anything about the reality beyond. None of it. So, so that's a real warning sign to
us to be very, very humble about our theories. Darwin's theory is a beautiful theory inside
space time. It has no traction outside whatsoever. It's all of it as an artifact. And, and so that,
so we're not moving towards the theory of everything. We should be very, very humble.
I'm curious. Do you think that there are levels of fundamental reality that are simply inconceivable
to the human mind and understanding? Like we wouldn't expect a monkey to understand quantum
mechanics or entanglement or have even the baseline ingredients to be able to have any
semblance of anything regarding quantum mechanics. Are there things that you think that
are simply beyond the capacity of the human mind to understand and deeper levels of reality?
That's, I do. I think that the human mind has great capacities and fundamental limitations.
And when spiritual traditions tell us to set aside the human mind now and then,
spend time in meditation and put the, the human mind apart, you, you, of course,
then when you try to reconceptualize what you experienced, you can only reconceptualize it
inside the human mind. That's, that's the tool you've got. But in fact, you infinitely transcend
the human mind. So, so you aren't the human mind. You, when you talk to me through these
avatars, we're having to use the human mind and therefore all of a sudden the bandwidth goes down
to a straw, a little tiny straw of information that goes back and forth. But you and I are, in fact,
the infinite intelligence looking at itself through this particular little straw. So,
yeah, the human mind has this incredibly. Write that down. But, but, but you are not
the human mind. You transcend infinitely the human mind. But as long as you're in this avatar,
you can only have a human mind appreciation of that transcendence. I love that.
So, I mean, right now we're exploring, you know, the, the boundaries or limitations of our possible
understanding. And I know that you've talked to the value of discovering the limitations of
our mathematical theorems and because they show us what's possible and how we can invent GPS and
so much of things that we use and take for granted in our convenient modern society.
And it also shows us where it fails, right? And so, what, what is the value of discovering
the limitations? Do you feel like, and how it redirects us in our energy and their search?
Well, I think it, it's valuable for a couple reasons. One reason is simply that it's true
that the mathematics is powerful as mathematics is and I love mathematics.
All the theorems that you can prove are a trivial subset of the theorems that are out there.
And all the theorems that are entailed by any set of axioms you write down
are trivial subset of all the theorems that, that are true. So, it's really important to, to know
that. That's a, once again, I think it's, one way to think about it is that it's the infinite
intelligence giving itself a wake-up call, giving its avatars, its projections a wake-up call.
It's, it's plunging itself in all the way with both feet, it's losing itself in there, but it's
giving itself a little hint from the mathematics that says, no matter how smart and mathematically
precise you are, it's going to be trivial compared to the reality beyond. Wake-up call, wake-up call,
you aren't your projection, you aren't the avatar. Reality transcends, infinitely transcends anything
that you can do in your science and your mathematics, which is not to say, don't do your
science, do your, I'm a scientist, I love, I'm not a mathematician, I wish, I wish I were,
I work with mathematicians, but I am a scientist. And so, I'm, I'm all for the science and the
mathematics, but, and it's wonderful to get a better appreciation of this projection of, of,
of these avatars. But ultimately, that's a, a big hint to ourselves from Gertl's incompleteness
theorem, for example, that there's infinite, infinite exploration beyond what you could
even do with your science and your mathematics. So, that's, that's a very important wake-up call.
So, let's explore that incompleteness theorem. I've been geeking out, diving deeper into
Gertl's incompleteness theorem, also his life and who he was as an individual, very, very
interesting, regarded as one of the most brilliant logicians to possibly have ever lived. And I
recall Einstein referring to him as kind of like the smart one, like he would like love to come
back and go on long walks with him. And a very interesting individual also had these metaphysical
practices of laying down and intuiting mathematical objects and different things like that, which
I want to, I want to talk to you about in a little bit. But for people that don't know what the
incompleteness theorem is, how would you break it down and describing truths that are truths,
but can't be proven? Well, what Gertl showed was that if I write down a certain set of axioms,
like for arithmetic, certain, you know, every number has a successor and things like that.
If my axioms are enough rigorous and enough complicated, so substantial enough to actually
be able to formulate all of arithmetic, to formulate arithmetic, then Gertl showed that he
could write down a sentence that was true and could not be proven from your axioms.
And that's pretty stunning, right? So that was the brilliance was to actually use the language
of mathematics to write down a sentence that says, I'm true, but can't be proven. And so he did that.
And which you can, you can say, well, okay, well, no problem, I'll just take that and add that to
my axiom. So now, now I'm good. I've got my, so this statement wasn't provable. So I won't,
I'll just throw it in as an axiom. But then Gertl's thing is recursive. He can then show you
another one. And this goes on ad infinitum. What this means is Gertl showed that basically,
you can't just write down a finite set of axioms and then a set of rules
and grind out all the truths. Truth transcends proof. There's a bottom, you know, in three words.
That's what that's Gertl in three words. Truth transcends proof. And that's
along the lines of what I was saying earlier that truth transcends any scientific theory.
Because every scientific theory is going to have a mathematical set of assumptions,
the axioms, and it will have mathematical derivation rules that are, of course,
usually at least is good enough for doing arithmetic. So every scientific theory is subject
to Gertl's incompleteness theorem, which means that as many truths as you can crank out with your
scientific theory, I'm sorry, as many proofs about realities, you can crank out the truth
infinitely transcends it. So this is another bit of humble pie. And again, my take home message
is not don't do science. Absolutely do science. Because science does crank out a lot of interesting
proofs that seem to be useful. But it also, to its credit, tells you that it can't give you the
whole truth. That's wonderful. So he ascribed binary, I believe, different numbers to certain
equations and theorems to be able to prove this. A random example that's just coming
to mind right now, I don't even know if it's accurate, but I'd love to hear is if I say
this statement, all men are liars. And I'm a man. If if I am lying, then that kind of eats itself
because is that statement true or false? If I if I'm lying that all men are liars, but that
that entails that I'm telling the truth about all men are liars, but I am also
so it's like it kind of eats itself in a really confusing way.
That's right. The liars paradox is an important point. Yeah, it's it's
I even know it's like a thing. The it is a very, very big thing in mathematics. And it's
there's also the barber of Seville, which is a similar the barber of Seville
shaves all and only those who don't shave themselves.
Who shaves the barber of Seville? Right, you get yourself into. So that's where this turns out
to be non-trivial in mathematics because you get things that Bertrand Russell discovered this
issue of in the set theory. So a lot of mathematics is set on set theory, you know, the set of all
integers, for example, or the set of all prime numbers, we have all the sets are very, very
important. But Bertrand Russell pointed out that what about the set of all sets that don't contain
themselves? Does that set contain itself or not? And you get this liars paradox kind of thing coming
out. So so that and that's, that's still a big, I mean, so what they have often done is is reduce
set theory to what they call a class theory to try to avoid these kinds of paradoxes. But
my take is that this is really not really resolved. I mean, there's, there is this
liar paradox kind of thing that that goes on in mathematics. And so, so,
yes, it's, it's pretty deep. But I would, I would say that the bed, the big one though is
that truth transcends proof. And that you kind of in a way have to be, you have to go outside of
a system to like fully understand it. And that consciousness is not amorphous, but structured
and that structuredness I guess goes to infinity. I would agree up to a point.
I would say that when you say consciousness is structured, I would say as a scientist,
I'm limited to describing consciousness as structured and having that structure go into
infinity. That's, and that's what I'm doing. So what you're describing is what I'm trying to do.
But, but I actually think that consciousness transcends structure,
infinitely transcends structure. But it can be structured. Just like projection of sure,
like, like we're structures of consciousness in a way that that's right. But what you are
literally does transcend any words or any mathematics period.
But any, but there's an infinite number of perspectives that we could take on,
on the true consciousness. And in, in those, in many of those perspectives, then you could have
infinite mathematical description that I'm working on the paper I'm working on right now is,
is one. So I'm working on a paper right now where you want to share a little bit about
just a little, just to, just to touch. I love, I love to hear. Yeah. So, so it's,
we have this Markovian dynamics. So Markov chains describing a big social network
of interacting conscious agents, an infinite number of them in principle.
So it's just like, like you were talking about, I mean, an infinite structure description of,
of the one consciousness. And I'm doing that because that's the best I can do as a scientist.
But as I said earlier, I think that consciousness transcends that completely. So, so, so I'm
putting the humble pie right up front on this. But now with the humble pie there,
now let's look at the fun, fun part of this, this, this perspective.
It turns out that we discovered, just in this year, a, a new order on Markov chains that no one
had ever discovered before. And it's a way of saying when one Markov chain in some sense is
less than another or entails another. For those who know Markov theory, I'll just say it real
briefly. If you can take a Markov kernel, and if you take a trace of it, of that Markov chain on
a subset of its states, like the first three states or something like that, you'll get a new
Markovian kernel called the trace chain. So you can take a big Markovian kernel, trace it on a
subset of its states, and you get a new Markovian kernel that's called the trace chain of it. And
I can go into an intuition on that if you want to, I can say a little bit more intuitively
about what that means. But what this logic is, is we discover that if you say one Markovian kernel
entails another or observes another, if and only if it's a trace of the other. So it's a trace
chain of the other. Then you get a complete logic. All consciousnesses are, are, are now tied
together in this one big logic. You could talk about when they can actually, it tells you how to
combine consciousnesses, when they can combine into new higher consciousnesses, and when they can't.
It's a non-bullying logic. And what it, it, it shows that consciousness
can go infinitely far in complexity, in infinitely many directions. There's no,
there's no one top consciousness in this math, this model. So even this mathematics is already
complex enough to say whatever consciousness is, there's not just a single little guy at the top.
There's an infinite number of directions you can go infinitely far. And, and so we'll be publishing
it this year, this paper. So there's this whole logic of all the, the, the little consciousnesses
and bigger and bigger consciousnesses, how they combine to, to ultimately point to the one consciousness
which transcends our logic. But with this, with this logic, we're, this is going to be
part of the key for us making the math into space time and, and the physics, and giving a theory
of observation. Because we, we now have a theory, what does it mean for one consciousness to observe
another? It's, if it's a trace of, of the other. And that's going to be, we're, we're thinking it's
going to be a big, big help in, in physics because in quantum theory, they don't have a theory of
observation. They, they don't have a theory of the observer. So when you don't observe something,
there's a unitary linear evolution of the system. But when you observe, whatever process is,
whatever system is doing the observation is non-linear, it's non-unitary. And so for quantum
theory has been out for almost 100 years, in 1926 to now, so 98 years. And no theory of observation
because you can't reduce a non-unitary process to a unitary one, you just can't do it. So we're,
we're proposing a theory of observation for, for physics.
With what you just described, is it, is it possible that it could be linked to what someone,
someone would regard as a kind of contentious exploration with James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis
that the earth is itself a living organism? And I'm curious if this, because it sounds like
you're exploring the inter, how consciousness is kind of like linked together. Do you feel like
conscious agents such as Don, Andre, everybody that lives on earth and the organisms that live here,
like conscious agents could kind of stack to create a bigger one. For example, Gaia,
do you see is that as a possibility? Well, yes, but it's a completely different framework from,
from the Gaia kind of hypothesis. So, so let me sort of explain the difference in perspective.
From the theory of conscious agents, it's saying that consciousness is fundamental
and space-time and its objects are just a headset. So, to make it really radical,
how radical it is, most of us think of ourselves as little 100 to 200 pound
tiny objects inside of an infinite space-time with trillions of galaxies and so forth. So on this
tiny little 200 pound object in this massive universe that's been there for
almost 14 billion years and so forth. And what I'm saying is, that's completely wrong.
Whatever you are, space-time is a trivial data structure inside you. So, you're not this trivial
200 pound object inside this vast space-time. That vast space-time is a trivial data structure
inside you. So, that's how radical what I'm saying is much more radical than the Gaia hypothesis.
So, if you're looking for who is the bigger or not, right? But then the idea is that our,
what we view, we look around us, we see what we think is a distinction between animate
and inanimate objects. I mean, I'm not worried about hitting this, whereas I'd be worried
about hitting you. If I hit the microphone, you know, it might mess up the audio a little bit,
but I'm not worried about causing any pain on anybody, whereas if I hit you, I would be causing
pain. So, we have this distinction between animate and inanimate objects. And the Gaia hypothesis
starting to sort of play with that, say, well, you know, maybe the difference between living and
non-living isn't as tight as we thought. Well, I think that that's right in the following sense.
The distinction we make between animate and inanimate objects, I claim, is completely
unprincipled. There's no principle distinction between animate and inanimate at all.
When I, the, in this point of view, the only reality is consciousness. That is the reality.
So, I'm always interacting with my headset, space-time headset. I'm always interacting with
consciousness. But my consciousness, my headset is dumbing things down, right? And that's what
headsets do. They, they're a simplifying thing. Right now, so I have some insight into your
conscious experiences through my headset. But, but when I look at a mouse, I'll get much less
insight, but some, when I look at an amoeba, much less, like the virus, much less. And then when
I look at, you know, protons, neutrons, none, rocks, none. But think about it this way.
Suppose I'm talking with you on a Zoom screen, and there's a bunch of pixels on my screen.
Some of the pixels are pixels of your face. And those pixels provide me with a portal into
you, into what you're thinking. I mean, like, if you smile, I can, you know, he must be happier,
or frown, he doesn't like what I just said. So, I get some insight from those pixels about your
conscious experiences. But the pixels of the wall behind you, no, no insight into consciousness
whatsoever. Now, I wouldn't want to say, ah, so there is a distinction between animate and inanimate
pixels. Those are the living pixels, and those are the none. That's dumb. Pixels are pixels. They're
part of an interface, a headset, or a desktop. And, and, and some of them, some pixels provide a portal
into the consciousness, you know, and others don't. And so this is the way I think about
why there's no distinction between animate and inanimate objects.
Space time is just a headset. The headset sometimes gives me insight into consciousness,
sometimes it doesn't. That's what headsets do. They dumb things down. That's a limit of the headset,
not an insight into reality. So when I look at a rock, I am interacting with consciousness.
But my interface is so impoverished that all I get is a rock.
Yeah. Now, I hope that the back and forth goes both ways, that just as the consciousness on the
other side can't really affect me too much directly, I can't affect the consciousness too much through
the rock. If I smash the rock, as I might have to do if I'm building a house or something like that,
I would hate to think that I was causing pain on the other side. But I don't know. I mean,
there's no portal into the conscious experience of a rock.
That's right.
But I mean, we could assume that objects with no central nervous system would not be able to
feel pain in that way. But I'm curious. So you think, do you believe that all inanimate objects
have a degree of sentience, like having a sliver, a type, a scale somewhere of a conscious
experience? I don't. And I don't think the human body has any sentience either,
because body is just an interface description. It has nothing. Your body, the body that I see,
that I call Andre, only exists when I perceive. That body is now gone. It only exists in the
instant. So rocks don't have this liver of consciousness because rocks don't even exist
when they're not perceived. And the human body, the human brain doesn't exist when it's not perceived.
I have no neurons right now. So when we say local realism is false, we have to be completely
thorough. Local realism is absolutely false. And that means the human body only exists when it's
perceived. And it doesn't contain consciousness. However, when I see a human body, I know my
interface is telling me, don't do certain things, because my interface has given me a way that could
affect consciousness. So I just want to clarify here. Are you saying that when you look away from me,
I cease to be rendered in your experience. So in a way, I cease to exist.
But the fundamental constituents of my consciousness, although not rendered in real
space time, still do exist, but completely detached from the way our sensory system would perceive it.
That's right. You're not in space time. Yeah. Space time is in you.
Completely. Yeah. So you're entirely outside of space time. And your body
is literally just a pixel description. When I take my camera and point it, the pixels for
Andre will light up and I now have Andre pixels. As soon as I turn the camera, those pixels are
gone. There is no, and your body is just as ephemeral as that. Even to myself, right? Right now,
I have no brain. There's literally no neurons. There's no neuron. Now, if you did a scan, you
would find neurons, but that's because you're intervening and looking. So you get a picture.
Now you've got your pixels that you've sort of said, now I've got my pixels making neurons.
Okay, fine. But neurons only exist in the act of observation. You don't have
neurons when they're not received, but you do have what neurons are connected to.
Would you say that? Nothing in space time exists when it's not received.
Nothing. Space time itself doesn't exist when it's not received.
But the objects- So this goes way beyond the Gale hypothesis, right?
I know, I know. But the objects in space time, they are connected to the structure of reality.
Just like the pixels on the desktop are a portal to, back and forth, when we're talking to each
other. So yeah, a folder on your desktop screen doesn't exist when it's not received,
but the electrical gates and things that are happening within the computer system,
those do exist. In that metaphor, they do. But when I let go of, when I then step back and
apply that metaphor to all the space time, then they don't exist anymore. So I use that metaphor
just to get people to understand the ideas. So for sake of argument, let's assume the computer is
real. Yeah. The circumstances are real. People will grant me that. Once they understand, okay,
oh yeah, no, there's no blue rectangular icon inside the computer. You won't find that. So my
file on the desktop, there's nothing on the computer, it looks like. Once you get that,
then you have to kick that ladder away. That includes kicking away the computer itself.
It doesn't exist when it's not perceived. All right. So yeah, I mean, it's, I feel like no
matter how many conversations I have with you, there's still some more head wrapping. I have to,
like I need to wrap my head around this even further. And I feel like our audience does too.
It takes many times of talking about this and exposure to it to like.
The rabbit hole goes deeper. It does. It keeps going. It just seems to keep going.
I'm as uncomfortable as you are, by the way. I mean, I have gone through this kicking and
screaming myself. Just grasping onto space time as it, as a rug fully gets pulled underneath you.
Well, and emotionally, I don't believe it one bit. I can see when I do meditation and so forth.
I realized the amount that this has penetrated into my emotional belief in is 1%.
Yeah.
But the logic, I mean, I just can't argue with the logic and who knows when my emotions will
come along for the ride. There seems to be various enlightened beings, masters of meditation,
that have emotionally embraced it. What they would say is close to 100%.
Where they have literally no fear of the body because they clearly have the perception that
it is not them. Where if somebody comes up to you, God forbid on the street and puts a gun to your
head, I'd be scared to death. It seems like in the metaphysical practices and the contemplative
sciences, you can arrive at the place experientially, emotionally, where you truly perceive the source of
that which you are and therefore that which you are not does not have the grip over you.
Which is interesting because it requires both the rigorous science and logic to be able to explore
these things and explain it with the limited capacity we have for language with language.
And then the contemplative practices that allow us to arrive there experientially,
to become closer and intimate and become one with that which we truthfully are.
I completely agree and I think that there are spiritual masters who are there.
At Cartola, for example, I suspect it truly doesn't fear death.
This is interesting to think about it this way. Think about a video game in which you jump into
the video game and you could be in the game identified with the avatar. That's me. So if it's
a shoot-em-up game and you think you are your avatar, you're going to be scared to death and
you're going to be really alert and suppose that I'm maybe sealed or something like that. I'm trying
to get you ready. So I'm putting you in this game. So I want to somehow drug you so that when you
get in the simulation, you think that's real because I want you to be scared to death and I
want you to learn how to fight in that thing. So I'm going to make you identified. So here's a drug
that makes you identified with your avatar in this VR game. And then boy, you really, you,
and then we'll slowly let you disidentify from that avatar. And that's what I think is going on
here is we're in this. Emotionally, I'm still identified with the avatar, but part of me is
recognized. Oh, Don, that's just an avatar. It's not you. But the emotional part of me is still
plugged into you are an avatar. The meditation process is slowly waking me up to the truth
that an avatar is just an avatar. Relax. Yeah. Just relax. It's just your avatar. You are the
infinite intelligence of which this whole simulation is a trivial little game that you
is no effort for you, whatever. It's literally nothing. And all the wealth and all the possessions
you could possibly have, you could be the richest man on earth. None. It's nothing. It's absolutely
nothing. It's just a little game on you and you could make a billion other much better games than
that. So that's it. But see, mostly I'm still, it's very, very interesting to know that I am the
infinite intelligence. I've woken up a little bit, but not completely. So I'm still halfway between
identifying with the avatar and halfway, a dissidentifying with the avatar. And I agree that
there are spiritual masters who have completely disidentified. And I would love to disidentify
because it's no fun to be afraid. Yeah. I find it so interesting how
I think largely like around the time of the Vienna Circle and the like 19th, 20th century,
there was kind of this big divorce between the simultaneous contemplative practices and
metaphysical practices alongside the scientific explorations. And like most people don't understand
the degree in which Newton himself had just as much exploration into alchemy than the sciences.
And it makes sense that they're kind of, they're one and the same in the source. And then there's
the experiential side and then there's the logical side. There's the particle, there's the wave.
There's two ways to come at something from the top down, from the bottom up,
in the way that it's processed. I'm curious because I know you meditate for like roughly
two hours a day, at least you sit in silence. And Kurt Godel was somebody who
very, very viscerally felt that you could lay down and he would say he would lay down for
hours and get rid of all of his senses. So hearing, tasting, touching, smelling,
he would feel that you could intuit directly mathematical objects that since we're connected
to it, there shouldn't be any reason that by abiding in the place in which we are connected
to it, that you shouldn't be able to have intuitions around it that then come into your
mind or your thought that you could then channel into his work. And he said that he did that very,
you know, and he's one of the most brilliant logicians to ever exist. And he was doing that.
So I would just be so curious to see what would happen if the most brilliant
minds in today's stage had those practices to support them on the practices as well. So
how do you feel like your practice has personally benefited you on that journey?
Well, I think that it's absolutely essential. I didn't start meditating for that reason. I
started meditating for the very pedestrian reason that I was having hard time sleeping
and I didn't want to take drugs. And so I said, well, they'll meditate. But then I realized later
on, well, there's a lot more to this meditation and just helping me with my sleep. This is pretty
profound transformation that's going on here. So I can't take credit or anything like that. I just
was doing it for my own little silly reasons. But then I stumbled on to this is pretty important.
And now I use it explicitly as a tool. I need new ideas. Go into silence. I mean,
when you realize that you are that infinite intelligence, that's what you are. But if you
don't let go of your Bayesian priors, you'll only see your posterior. So I have to,
how do you let go of your Bayesian priors? There's only one way to do it. That's literally to let go.
No thoughts. How can you get into the unknown if you don't leave the known?
That's exactly right. So I think this is absolutely essential for scientists. And I
think that the very best creative ones, whether or not they're, they know it, they go into a
moment of silence when the real deep intuitions come. Of course, you have to do your homework,
you've studied your math, you see, there's no, there's no substitute for doing the hard work.
It's just like a powerful, brilliant musician without understanding and practicing their
skills. Then they can throw it out the window and it's a part of their unconscious competence.
And then they sit down, listen, and something beautiful, the next masterpiece comes through.
That's right. You had to do your homework. But then, then is when you sort of let go of what
you know, that the new originality comes through. And Einstein did talk about that. He said that his
big ideas came to him in vague images and so forth. And for me too, it's, it's, I'm no Einstein
by a long shot. But, but my ideas when they do come, come from moments of silence where I've
done my homework, I have a problem I'm trying to solve. And then all of a sudden I follow myself
just going deep silence. And then all of a sudden I see something coming. So I think for scientists
to actually take advantage of that to realize you are that infinite intelligence,
let go of your, of course, build your priors. That's what science is. Build these really good
prior. But, but then let go of them. If you need to transcend Newton, you have to let go of Newton
for a while before you can go to, you know, quantum and general relativity and so forth. You have to
let go of Newtonian ideas. And so going into the silence beyond any concept is, is really critical.
So it's again an interesting back and forth and we're getting a little picture perhaps of what
the one is doing all the time in is, is that back and forth between I've got this perspective on
myself. I got the Newtonian perspective. That was fun. Let me go, let me go deeper. Oh, oh,
now I got relativity. Oh, now I've got quantum mechanics and that's still trivial compared
to what I am. But, but, but that was an interesting new perspective. And so
even these perspectives as fun as they are are trivial compared to what you are.
What do you say to people that would comment on this podcast? Like somebody did the last time
saying, what difference does it make if reality is an illusion? The pain I feel is real to me.
The joy I feel is real to me. We are having an experience that is obviously incredibly valuable
and it feels real to us. So I guess how would you respond to somebody that says,
why does it matter if reality is an illusion? Which it might seem like a trite kind of after
our whole conversation, you know, it seems silly to ask that question because it has very real
implications. But how would you respond to that? Well, I'd say a couple of things. I think all of
us are inquisitive. Who am I? Why am I here? What is this all about? I mean, maybe some people
are not. But, but I think most of us are. And then most of us, when we start hearing
the various stories that people tell, find them, man, it's probably not good enough. That story
is probably not good enough. And, and so I think it's, it's really important because we are
inquisitive and that may be what we're here for, in fact, is why does the one plunge itself into
avatars is because it's answering the question, who am I? And it's taking, is taking an infinite
number of different perspectives and looking and saying, oh, from this perspective, I could talk
about myself this way. And from, so there's, and so the, so to find out that, that this is just a
perspective is important, that this is an illusion, this is just a perspective. So using those two
things together here and there, it's, it's, it's, it's a perspective. Therefore, it's not the truth.
Therefore, it's, it's in that sense, illusory is perhaps as best language can be used to describe
it. What we're here for in the first place, we're, we're here to learn that this is an illusion,
but it was an interesting illusion. And look how complicated we are from this point of view. And
yet we transcend all of, all of that. So that would be, I mean, one answer. On the other hand, I think
if someone persisted in saying that, I'd say, well, that would be another perspective that
the one takes on itself from, from, from your avatar. And, and maybe that's what the one needed
to see from that perspective as well, that I, relax. And in some sense, yeah, relax. You are,
you, there's nothing that needs to be completed about you. You are already the infinite.
So maybe this is just really about enjoying all the perspectives, including the perspective.
Who gives him? Yeah. Yeah, no, I love that. I'm curious what you think as we've been exploring
like alternative views from the conventional notion of our understanding of reality,
what do you think starts to open into otherwise like contentious fields of understanding of
out-of-body experiences, precognition, remote viewing, near-death experiences with this understanding
that we've been exploring with consciousness. What, what implications do you feel like it has
in those realms? Well, if you're a physicalist, these things can't happen. If, if like me,
you're a conscious realist, I can't rule them out. Now, as a hard-nosed scientist,
I'm not happy just to say I can't rule them out. Therefore, I'm going to
say that these things are all real. Absolutely not. I'm going to be hard-nosed still about
it. What I'm not going to do is rule them out a priori, but, but I'm more than 100% sure
that most of these are probably confabulations, right? Probably most things are confabulations,
but there is, for example, the near-death experiences that there seem to be, there's some
systematic experiences of the tunnel, the light, the life review, maybe a decision to come back.
That seems pretty consistent, so I wouldn't rule that out at all, but here's, here's where I get
hard-nosed about it. As a scientist, I'm on a theory, right? So, and I'm working on it, so we'll see,
but if space-time is just a headset, then what does, in some sense, my experience of me is just
an avatar in that, and now we have these experiences of an avatar going through a tunnel and seeing
a white light and review. I want my theory of conscious agents to be able to show how we make
a headset and then show me precisely when that headset is coming to an end for a particular avatar.
Why, or how, I could get this tunnel with a light experience. In other words, until I have a
scientifically precise theory of this and then can make predictions that are testable,
all we have are informal accounts, hints, in other words, a pre-scientific kind of approach,
and what we've found throughout human history is, of course, you can do great things without
science, and you get geniuses who just have good intuitions and do things, but when you actually
get the systematic science stuff, you find out that most of what you believed was nonsense.
Most of the things that people did were just plain nonsense. Not all. Sometimes, you know,
indigenous people have some really deep insights that you can't explain how they got that, but
most of the time, there's just plenty of nonsense. So my guess is, if I were a physicalist, I'd say
all nonsense. Nothing to be saved here. This is all just illusions caused by the brain activity
and so forth. So I'm not saying that whatsoever. So I'm not saying it's all nonsense. I'm saying,
at least in principle, it's not all nonsense. I'm saying in practice, probably most of it,
99% of the reports are probably just not accurate, but that doesn't mean that there's
something deeper that it isn't true. I think that life does not end with the death of the body.
It's just taking off the avatar. So I think that maybe as Hoffman doesn't exist anymore,
but the consciousness that was the true thing behind Hoffman will continue to exist because
it's the infinite consciousness. So I may lose everything that I'm attached to in terms of
the Hoffman ego. All that has to go and spiritual teachers tell us to die before you die. And
that's, I think, that's right. In some sense, if I can die to everything about Hoffman and don't care
about Hoffman, because Hoffman's just an avatar, then when there's time for the avatar to go
goodbye, it'll be just like in the VR game. Once I've not identified with the avatar, when this
game over, I don't care. That was just my avatar that died. It's not me. It's my avatar that died
and then shut down that game. So I guess I'll summarize what I'm saying.
I cannot dismiss any of these, the near-death experiences or any of these kinds of things.
I can't dismiss them out of hand. But I think that those who take consciousness as fundamental
owe it to everybody to give absolutely rigorous scientific accounts of these things and to hold
the highest standards in terms of the data that we try to collect and so forth.
So this is not, you know, saying consciousness fundamental is not an invitation to just accept
any hypothesis and say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It means I'm open to them, but I'm going to be hard
nosed about them. And that's what we should do because if there is something real there,
then we want to understand really what it is. Yeah. I'm curious, if you had to give your best guess,
if when we die, consciousness still exists, in regards to reincarnation, which there's been
some interesting studies about kids that come in and have actual memories that you can verify in
the real world of people who have lived, that they claim as them, from where they lived to people
that they were in relationship to, to favorite objects that they had. If it is in the case that
somehow this consciousness leaves and then does take another form, how could it possibly be done
where, I guess, memory is stored in consciousness and could take on another avatar?
Right. Well, this is quite interesting because I was approached by a team of
brilliant researchers. One of the head of the team is a research scientist at Caltech,
and most of them are Indians, so they're, I think, more Hindu and possibly they're very
interested in reincarnation. And I actually gave a talk in their workshop at the Science
of Consciousness conference in Tucson back in April. And they found out about this
trace logic that I've mentioned, trace chains and Markov chain, and they realized that that might
actually give them the tools they need for understanding reincarnation. So I've been
collaborating with them, and they're going to actually be implementing that logic
and trying to start to make predictions from it of reincarnation. Now, I'm just
giving them help to understand the basic logic. I'm not actually part of their research team,
but I'll help them. So I have no axe to grind on this. I mean, I know very little about the
theory of reincarnation and so forth, but they do. They're quite immersed in it. So I'll be very
interested to see, but this trace logic of conscious agents seem to be the first mathematical
framework that they'd ever seen that had the potential to begin to address these kinds of
questions rigorously, mathematical rigor. So they'll be doing some big simulations,
big, big matrices with millions of entries and so forth to try to get at this. And the kind of
question you asked is going to be the kind of question we'll try to answer. How could the memories
of one life, one avatar sort of be stored in the network and then downloaded into another headset
and so forth? Right. Yeah, be very interesting. Yeah. But so finally, we have a mathematical
framework that's rigorous enough and can be implemented in computers to test it,
which is fun. I mean, at least with science, you can actually test things and go,
most of the time you realize your ideas are just wrong. That's just wrong. Whereas if you
don't have the mathematics, you can believe for many, many years that you're on the right track
when you're deeply wrong. Yeah. You mentioned how our understanding of spacetime and Newtonian
physics has buried many fruits and technologies that we use in every day, in the everyday world.
What do you think could be some possible practical applications of this new understanding of
consciousness and how it would change how we live in the practical world tactically?
I think that you can't think big enough on what it's going to do. Quantum mechanics opened up
incredible technologies that are mind-blowing. What are some fields perhaps that you think
would be like revolutionized? Well, transportation, for example. So right now,
there are billions or maybe even trillions, but at least billions of galaxies that would be fun to
explore. The nearest one is more than 2 million light years away. That's the nearest one. Well,
even if we're traveling through space near the speed of light, that's a long, long time. If you
put some humans on the spaceship, the great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids
wouldn't be alive. So you can see that's our nearest galaxy. So going through spacetime
and seeing any of the real estate is just not possible with our current way of thinking.
But what if you realize that spacetime is just a headset and you know the code? So in some sense,
so think about someone who's, again, a real wizard at Grand Theft Auto. They know how to
drive their car faster than anybody else and they know the terrain and they can beat everybody.
That's great, but if you're the software engineer who wrote the code, well, you can do things that
are magic to the wizard. You can give them a flat tire anytime you want to. You can take the gas
out of this tank. You can change the geometry of the roads. You can take his car and move it from
one side of the game to the other instantly, just like that, by changing a pointer. Well,
when we're, this theory of conscious agents is really the first layer of software outside of
our spacetime headset. We're starting to learn how the game is rigged. How do we play, how,
what is a software that's playing the spacetime game? Once we understand that, I don't think we'll
have to go through spacetime to the Andromeda galaxy. We can go around spacetime. We can just be
there. And that's just one. I think you just can't think big enough. Once you know the software,
you can change the game pretty much any way you want to.
It feels like there's not an area of life that it wouldn't revolutionize. Think about healing. If
you understand the deeper dynamics of how the projection of all of ourselves work together,
what we maybe would have spent decades trying to heal physiologically or travel to
within the limits of the speed of light, all of a sudden miraculously cease to exist because
you're working with dynamics outside of the headset. That's right. So I think in medicine,
probably there'll be all sorts of remarkable things. As I mentioned earlier, the 86 billion
neurons and roughly the same number of glial cells make the brain is really complicated.
But we're going to be going to the more complex software outside of it. We'll actually be able
to understand and maybe rewire the brain outside of spacetime and then also understand
systems in the body at a much deeper level and then rewire them. So yeah, I think that
the revolution in medicine will be remarkable. What do you think it will take for the brilliant
physicists that are currently out there to pivot their intelligence to exploring realities beyond
spacetime, beyond the headset? Well, the Universe Plus project that the European
Research Council has funded already has over 100 scientists doing that. So they're funding
the look for these new positive, and understanding these positive geometries
beyond spacetime. That's very different than saying that they're after consciousness,
they're not. Maybe individuals are, but that's not what the ERC is up to.
I'm actually trying to get one of these. Trying to recruit one of them. I've got money for a post
doc for two post docs. So what I need is someone with a recent PhD in algebraic geometry,
specific branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which is really critical to these
positive geometries, or a real understanding of high energy theoretical physics, and in
particular the amplitude and so forth. Because in the current paper, we're going to make a
projection to a special case of the amplitude, but we would like to have someone who can actually
help us do the real whole deal. So we want to do proof of concept in this paper and show that we
can actually start with conscious agents and predict scattering of gluons in spacetime so that
we now can go all the way. So we've got the little bridge across. Now we need someone to help us
build the whole thing, a big, big road across. So we're looking for relative new PhDs in
high energy theoretical physics or algebraic geometry can help us with this. But ultimately,
once we do that, if we can actually make a prediction, a new prediction inside spacetime
from a dynamical system, a mark of conscious agents, we can show that these positive geometries
arise from it. We can actually make new predictions that are testable and then come out to be true
inside of spacetime. We won't have any trouble at that point getting people. Now we may have trouble
having them take it seriously as consciousness. They might say, consciousness, munchiness, who
cares about that? But you've got a Markovian dynamics outside of spacetime. I'm good with that.
So let's just, let's go with that. And so it's not going to be a proof of consciousness being
fundamental, but it'll be perhaps an indication that a Markovian dynamical system outside of
spacetime is an important next step in science. And that would be fine with me. If they dismiss
the conscious stuff, that's perfectly fine. I completely respect that. But I would be
loving to give you, these guys are brilliant, guys in the generic sense. These people are
brilliant and much more smart in this stuff than I am. And so I'll just be able to then kick back
and try to read their papers. That's what I want. Yeah. I'm so curious to see what evolves in that
space. And then also globally, I mean, as these new innovations and discoveries come on board,
I'm curious to see what happens with religious fundamentalists, with people's understanding
of perceptions on God too. Would you say that, I don't love the term or using it because it's so
tainted, but the closest thing approximating the term God would be the collective consciousness
of all that is? Well, I would say that the word God and then the word collective unconsciousness
or collective consciousness are pointers. And that the thing itself completely transcended.
It is not even a thing. Going back to the mint. Yeah. Even to say the thing itself is already
a mistake. Right. So all these things are pointers to something that transcends. And again,
I said something. So as soon as I start using language everywhere, as soon as I say something,
I realize, wrong again, wrong again, wrong again. Maybe for the next podcast, you should just sit
here in silence for a few hours. Well, that's right. And bore people to death to enlighten them.
Yeah. So I think the deepest, rigorous thing I've seen so far is this
trace logic on the space of conscious, of Mark Covington. But that's, but having said that,
I then will immediately say it's a baby step and compared to the reality, zero. Right. So I think
that we can go differently beyond what I've done, what my team has done with this Markov,
trace chain thing. And even if we go infinitely beyond it, and we do that for a trillion years,
we'll be zero percent of the way toward understanding what you already are completely.
Because it's infinite. It's completely infinite. No matter how big the number gets, it's still
nothing in comparison. And that puts the light of dogmatism, right? It's really,
dogmatism is really missing the point. Dogmatism is missing the point that
what you can say about it is never it, never it. There's no right formulation of words.
And killing people because their formulation of words is different from yours is really to miss
the point that, you know, I don't know what the word is for meant in Spanish, but
saying meant in Spanish versus saying in English is nothing to kill over. Hey,
we're pointing to the same thing. You're just saying it in Spanish. I'm saying it in English.
Don't listen. Let's not kill each other over it. We're pointing to the same thing,
which is what you are and what everybody else is, you know, they are that and they are that
completely already. And what is interesting that the one
consciousness chooses to put itself into avatars and let itself get so
wrapped up that it forgets itself and it kills. It has some avatars kill others.
Ultimately,
when you realize it's just an avatar, in some sense, nothing was really ever lost.
When you with your friends and you shoot up your friends avatar and then afterwards you
take off your headsets, laugh, have a beer together and it's just your avatar.
It's just like the, I don't know if you've seen the film, Ready Player One, but I love it. And it
gives a perfect description of what could be very real in the next 20 to 30 years, if not less, where
you have a setup that you plug into with a headset and biofeedback technology
that plugs you into another reality that is extremely real. And if the rise of technology
is at all moving forward, given enough time, well, we will come to the place where
our games are, we can plug into another virtual reality that seems extremely real. And you take
like GTA or Sims just further down the line as AI and technology advances. It's not far off from
the future reality that we could create what is like a simulation and what seems to be conscious
beings having an experience, whether or not they are is up for debate.
But then we get lost in the sauce, so to speak. We think that we are the character. And yeah,
you've given a lot of important pointers to waking up beyond who we are in this headset.
Yeah, I think that you're right that there's going to be an infinite
number of directions we can explore with different kind of simulations and so forth and
exploring different physics, right? We can change the laws of physics in these new worlds and see
how we adapt to them. Why not have instead of three dimensions of space, one of four dimensions
of space. Actually, a friend of mine, Mike Desmura, a professor at UCI probably 20 years ago,
was already doing that with his graduate students. They were making four-dimensional worlds and having
people learn to plan these four-dimensional worlds. And one of the graduate students
claimed in their thesis that people were learning to actually experience, you know,
to actually see in four dimensions. And I didn't buy, I let him get his PhD, but I didn't buy that.
But I think if you trained infants, but I don't think you can do this for ethical reasons, but if
you trained infants, possibly, possibly, they might be able to develop a four-dimensional,
a real four-dimensional space-time experience. So, yeah, I think that we can certainly push
the parameters and our imagination is the only limit. I'm very interested to see what happens
as we can, also within the headset, explore the boundaries of what our senses are capable of.
Forgot the scientist or researcher that was Anika Harris, who we just had on was referring to, but
they're actually training, like, for example, the sense of the magnetic field of the Earth.
And you could develop that sense to know where, like, North is based off of wearing this device,
and you can, like, it's a new sense that you could develop and have the capacity for. There is,
I believe, it's the Kogi tribe in South America, where within the first seven years, the chosen
shaman children largely live in darkness, which you could say is unethical, you could say many
different things, but they are developing a completely unique relationship to their internal
reality than people in the Western world, just like the opposite end of the spectrum,
and what that unlocks for their capacity to navigate those realms, you know, in their own
consciousness. It's very interesting. It really is, and also David Eagleman has been doing this
kind of research, right, where he's been sort of augmenting our senses in various interesting
ways. You could even have people that could sort of have the stock market information being played
onto their body, and they could sort of feel when this time does buy in, when this time does sell,
and so forth. They can build these intuitions. So, yeah, there's a lot of untapped potential
that we could use. I think it's really fascinating. Right now, we're doing this using just what we
know about the neuroscience inside the headset. Once we actually have stepped outside the headset,
and we know the software behind the neuroscience, then those kind of technologies, I think,
are going to be even more powerful. Yeah. Do you think we will create conscious AIs?
So, that's a good question. Most people, when they answer that question or even ask it,
what they're thinking about is this framework, that building a conscious AI means we're
starting with these unconscious circuits and software, physical stuff in space and time.
That's the fundamental reality. But if we get the right kind of complexity in the circuits
off and the software, then the unconscious circuits and software will give rise somehow
to the conscious experience. So, that's the way most people take your question,
and you try to answer it, and they'll say, oh, yeah, sure. Of course, we know that
physical systems can create consciousness. Your brain is a physical system, and it creates
consciousness. Neurons, neural circuits create consciousness. So, yeah. So, most people,
that's the kind of answer they're going to give. My answer is very, very different. I say that
neurons don't even exist when they're not perceived. Circuits and software don't exist,
except as ideas in my mind. So, I've got to rethink the question entirely. So, here's
how I rethink the question. Inside my headset, there are certain portals to consciousness.
One is what I call the Andre body. That's a portal into a consciousness. And we have one
technology that we know of that works for creating new portals into consciousness,
and that technology is having kids. So, it's low-tech, but it works. So, we actually have
a technology that opens up new portals into consciousness. So, from this point of view,
in which consciousness is fundamental, if we can actually reverse engineer with maybe the
concentration theory as the first baby step, understand that technology. What are we doing
when we have kids? From the point of view of consciousness, how is a new headset being created?
Once we've reverse engineered that, then we can ask ourselves, can we do it ourselves?
Can we just take that and do it abstractly? Instead of doing it through human mating,
can we actually do it in some sense, technologically? And I think ultimately,
the answer is probably yes, we'll be able to open new portals. And when we do it,
it may be that certain of the technologies we use will look in our headset like
artificial intelligences on computers, circuits. But now, notice that the answer is completely
different. I'm not saying that the circuits and software are creating the consciousness.
I'm saying that consciousness is fundamental. What looks like technology is an interface
representation that only exists when you happen to see it. So, the software and hardware aren't
even there when you don't look. The only thing that's there are the conscious agents. But through
your headset, it looks like a conscious robot that you're interacting with. So, you can see
why I had to give a long answer. If I just said yes, the answer is yes, I think we could do it.
But you can see that that would have given you entirely the wrong perspective on what I'm saying.
Yeah, the first example you gave is like, if you've seen Ex Machina, the movie where they
essentially develop this like through the wet wear and the hardware, this sentient AI humanoid
robots, that would be creating it, essentially creating consciousness through
figuring it out throughout the Newtonian world, essentially.
If you assume that physical is framework, you're not going to understand really what you're doing.
Now, it may be that ultimately, we'll find with this theory which is consciousness fundamental,
we'll figure out what we have to do inside of our headset and maybe it'll look like the Ex Machina
kind of thing. But what we'll realize is that what we're really doing is rearranging this neural,
this network of conscious agents. It looks like neurons or circuits and software inside space
time. But what we're really doing is this new programming of conscious agents or whatever
transcend conscious agents. So, it still may work out that way, but the real scientific
theory will be much deeper than space time. And by the way, that's not just a cognitive
scientist saying that this is now the European Research Council putting 10 million euros on
the line saying these positive geometries outside of space time are the real deal.
This is the way forward. Let's do this. Incredible. Man, I'm just so, I love,
thank you so much for your time today. I'm just so, it brings me joy. I just feel like a giddy
kid who discovered a new toy every time I get to dive deep into this discussion that just
lights me up so much because starting to slowly chip away at a model of understanding the world
which has so many implications of how we navigate within it and diving deeper into the truth as
like, you know, that's the goal with here in the No Layer Self podcast to discover the true nature
of ourselves and the world around us. And I just putting it out there in the field, I have the
vision of producing these high quality round table discussions around specific areas of life, one
being music as medicine, another being around consciousness theories. And so, I'm excited to
hopefully in the next 12 months, I'm just going to find the location and find, you know, the way we
want to do it because it's a full thing to like have six date individuals. Fun. To start to create
these conversations that can be shared in all of its nuance and all of its many different perspectives
to start to like refine each other's perspective in a way that can be perceived for the masses and
for people online to be able to watch and intrigue interest for people that might want to go down
this path and find the way that the one uniquely wants to express itself through them. And so,
be on the lookout for that. I'm excited to have something like that in the future as well.
I think that's an excellent idea. I think that actually something new could come out of it when
you bring people together that are thinking roughly the same, but not exactly the same.
And they've done a lot of work. They're thinking about it really, really deeply. Then you get
some new sparks that they could really light something up. Yeah. Yeah. And I know researchers
obviously do that in their own accord behind closed doors and whatnot, but it's interesting when you
put it in the media, you know, and for people to view. And it's like the parable of the blind man
and the elephant, you know, let's sit down at a round table, put this elephant on the table
and start talking about it. Absolutely. Sweet. So amazing. Now, is there anything else you want
to share with their audience? Having understood, you know, the context of the conversation we
just have that you would like to wrap up on or share before we close? I would just say one thing.
This is the Know Thyself podcast. It's about Know Thyself. And I would just say that what I've
learned is that whatever you are transcends any description.
I'm sad. Amazing. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody that's been tuning into this episode.
If you made it through nearly two and a half hours, you're my kind of people.
I just love to share this joy and this conversation and dialogue. So thanks for
coming on this journey. As always, let us know in which ways this has uniquely impacted you.
And until next time, be well. Thank you, Don.
