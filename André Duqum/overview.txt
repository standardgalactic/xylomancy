 In this episode of the No Layer Self podcast, Dr. Don Lincoln, a theoretical physicist and author, joins the host for an in-depth conversation about consciousness and its potential fundamental nature. They discuss the limitations of Newtonian physics in explaining consciousness and the potential for a deeper scientific theory that transcends space-time, as hinted by the European Research Council's investment in positive geometries. Dr. Lincoln emphasizes that what we are manipulating in our quest to create artificial intelligence might be neural networks or software, but at a deeper level, we are programming conscious agents.

The conversation also touches on the potential for roundtable discussions on various topics, including consciousness theories and music as medicine, aiming to refine perspectives and share knowledge in a nuanced way. Dr. Lincoln encourages bringing together diverse thinkers to generate new ideas and insights.

Dr. Lincoln leaves the audience with a profound thought: whatever you are, transcends any description. He thanks the listeners for their time and engagement, especially those who endured nearly two and a half hours of discussion. He expresses his joy in sharing these conversations and invites the listeners to reflect on how these discussions uniquely impact them.

The episode wraps up with a call to action for the audience to stay tuned for future roundtable discussions that Dr. Lincoln plans to produce, which will delve deeper into various aspects of life, aiming to uncover the true nature of ourselves and the world around us.
