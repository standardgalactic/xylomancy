Checking Abner Coimbre/What Programming is Never About (Informal Lecture).txt
Abner Coimbre recently gave a presentation about his upcoming project, which revolves around teaching programming with a focus on Data-Oriented Design (DOD). The project includes a book that introduces terminology, uses examples from experts like Casey Muratori, and provides challenges for readers to practice their skills. Abner also mentioned that he has been offered by Pack Publishing to author a book on Java modular programming for enterprise applications. This offer came with a clause that allows him to potentially publish his DOD material through them as well.

Abner expressed his passion for the project and clarified that despite not being a fan of Java due to its restrictions, he will tackle the task of writing the book in a straightforward manner to ensure it's educational and useful. He also highlighted the open-source nature of the book, which will be DRM-free and available for download.

He emphasized the importance of understanding programming as an accessible and enjoyable activity, not a blindfolded ordeal, and encouraged viewers to explore programming in ways that make sense to them. Abner's Twitter handle is his full name, and he invited viewers to follow him for updates on his work and other endeavors.

He recommended checking out Handmade Hero for a comprehensive solution to learning programming and keeping an eye on Jonathan Blow's programming language, Lumina (formerly Jai), which embodies the principles of DOD. Abner concluded by expressing gratitude for the audience's time and indicating that he looks forward to interacting with them in the future.
