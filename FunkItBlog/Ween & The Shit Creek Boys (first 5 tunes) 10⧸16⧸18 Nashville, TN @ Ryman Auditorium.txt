Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go Nemesis
Westmyth Spring
You don't want to change how long
Or a brother or steps
Like a lizard or Georgia or a train I think
I called out your name girl
In the heat of night
Go on by answer
Is something right
Riff is the choice
To not know
To see if there's somebody
There'd be stuff on my mind
I won't hear a circle
I need a ring
I'm tossing it in turn
And crying in pain
Like a Japanese cowboy
Or a brother from space
I'm a lizard or Georgia
Or a train I think
I called out your name girl
In the heat of night
Go on by answer
Is something right
I'm crying in pain now
And crossing the line
Is from the rain and the rain she wore
And the tears in my eyes
Now the dead tire is empty
And the skin, my last time
And the blood burns up again
I got nothing but time
I can't hear it on my mind
A Japanese cowboy
Or a brother from space
I'm a lizard or Georgia
Or a train I think
I called out your name girl
In the heat of night
Go on by answer
Is something right
Is something right
I'm crying in pain
Like a Japanese cowboy
Or a train I think
I called out your name girl
In the heat of night
Go on by answer
Is something right
Is something right
Is something right
Yeah!
Yeah, that was on the move there

Colt, I don't want to leave you on the phone.
I don't want to leave you on the phone.
The days go by and I'm still alive.
But you know I'm thinking about you.
Colt's too loud.
He's small to the ground.
It's a sound that never lies.
Can you hear me?
I don't want to leave you on the phone.

It's called The Moms
They're another...
The Quat
It's called The Moms
It's called The Moms
Bless the Father, bless the Son
Cross your heart, lose your heart
Run the beams in the morn
Curve the sticks and put them on the system
In other homes, in other homes
To see you so beautiful by the time you leave
Think about it, turn around
Look back to your Quats
I'm a gentleman that's around the world
You are a fool
And I'm your son
You are a fool
But they're so beautiful
You can watch the world in a blue light
You can talk to them, feel the love in your tongue
My church is a fool
You are a fool
You can build up all the sins
Think about it, hold it
For your King, you wish me
A secret, a secret task for you
Think about it, turn around
Look back to your Quats
I'm a gentleman that's around the world
You are a fool
And I'm your son
You are a fool
But they're so beautiful
Bless the Father, bless the Son
Bless the Father, bless the Son
Bless the Father, bless the Son
Curve the sticks and put them on the system
In other homes, in other homes
To see you so beautiful by the time you leave
Think about it, turn around
Look back to your Quats
I'm a gentleman that's around the world
You are a fool
And I feel sorry for you
You are a fool
But they're so beautiful
You are a fool
You are a fool
You are a fool
You are a fool
