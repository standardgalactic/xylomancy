Hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing one of the bigger
mysteries of cosmology that you can sort of see circled right here. This is referred to as the
cold spot. The unusually large and relatively cold area inside the so-called cosmic microwave
background that for the longest time now did not have a definitive explanation. And in this video
we're going to be talking about one of the potential and most likely resolutions to this mystery
or basically what exactly formed this particular spot and just generally talk about some of the
most unusual and most mysterious structures in the universe usually referred to as supervoids.
But I actually wanted to start right here with this image of what's known as the Buddhist void.
Mostly because back in the days this was one of the most requested videos that I never specifically
made on this topic for the reason I'm about to explain. And a lot of people were basically wondering
so what exactly is the Buddhist void, what is this mysterious great nothing that it's usually
referred to as and what is forming these unusually large but empty structures. And one of the reasons
I never specifically made a video about Buddhist void is because well it's just one of many many
voids. And as a matter of fact it's not the largest or the closest to us. The closest one is known as
the local void and there is a video about this somewhere up there. But how exactly do these
structures form and what actually happens inside of them. And I guess the other question is where
are some of the larger ones. Well in general their formation is directly connected to the
formation of the cosmic web that essentially sort of spreads across the entire universe and usually
has the galaxies connecting to one another. In a sense the cosmic web itself sort of looks like
this and everything you see in the middle those are different galaxies and a lot of different
types of gas. But naturally in between the cosmic web and between all of these galaxies and all of
this gas there are these voids or slightly emptier space that doesn't contain as much density,
doesn't contain as many galaxies and doesn't generally contain much of anything. There is
still some stuff there, there are even some galaxies there, just not as many as inside the
web itself. And a lot of these simulations made over the last few years using very super computers
like this one right here known as the illustrious project have generally been able to recreate
this cosmic web showing the scientists exactly how all of this forms but more importantly also
recreating a lot of these structures such as voids and supervoids just as we see them in the real
universe as well. And so in essence some of these empty spaces right here these are the voids you
see in this three-dimensional map of the nearby space. Oh and by the way just to give you perspective
here these are actually huge distances. Here it's about 700 million light-years away from us
and our galaxy is not even visible in this picture it's just a tiny tiny blob somewhere right there.
But why exactly are we talking about this? Well as you probably guessed by now the recent study
quite thoroughly investigates and more or less definitively proves that this cold spot right
here sort of represents one of the biggest voids out there that in essence answers a lot of questions
including the question I asked previously about the biggest super void out there and also the
question in regards to why exactly this particular cold spot even exists. Although okay let's actually
take a few steps back and briefly talk about the cmb. So naturally what you're looking at right here
is the leftover radiation or the so-called relic radiation from the early universe. This was the
first light in the universe as it traveled across the universe for practically 13.8 billion years.
This light was originally created when the universe was just under 380 000 years old and basically
represents the first electromagnetic radiation that was created in the universe itself and by
traveling for 13.8 billion years it eventually sort of redshifted into the current frequencies
and even though originally it was about 3000 Kelvin in temperature now it's down to approximately 2.7
Kelvin so almost absolute zero temperatures and so in essence this is the light that's only visible
in the microwave spectrum of radiation in the gigahertz frequencies just above the radio waves.
But as you can see from the map there is quite a lot of variation with certain parts being specifically
interesting because they seem to be a little bit cooler but the actual temperature difference here
is very minute it's about 7 micro Kelvin or about 0.00007 degrees Kelvin but it is nevertheless a
representation of some sort of a difference or some sort of a structural formation that created
this particular cold spot and here's actually what all this would look like in a nice case if you
were to somehow see all of this radiation and since the original discovery of this cold spot a few
years ago there's been quite a lot of discussion about its potential origins one of the more
unusual sort of explanations in this case involved multiple universes in this case at least one
scientist made a somewhat controversial claim that it could maybe some sort of an imprint
from another universe that seems to be beyond our own something that happened before the cosmic
inflation early on in the creation or the formation of the universe now because it's somewhat difficult
to prove this and because the ideas here are basically extremely hypothetical it's practically
impossible to prove or disprove this so a better way to actually analyze this is to see if we can
come up with a better explanation if you are interested in this proposition though you can
check out more about this in the wiki in the description below and so the much better and
more widely accepted explanation in the last few years was actually in regards to the previously
mentioned voids in this particular case it's always been suggested that there was some kind of a
super void here so large that it would make it probably the largest void we've discovered so far
it's been always referred to as the eridanus super void and there are several physical theories
explaining how such a void would actually potentially create a cold spot inside the
microwave background radiation and so this new study decided to see if they can prove the existence
of this void by using the data from the so-called dark energy survey and specifically they actually
wanted to see if the observations from the plank telescope that created the microwave
background map could be then matched with some of the other maps for example produced by the dark
energy survey and this survey doesn't actually use microwave background radiation it uses entirely
different observations in this case it looks at various near ultraviolet visible and near
infrared observations and measures the expansion of the universe using type one supernova various
large galactic clusters and various other effects including gravitational winding effects produced
by various events and by using this survey in the past the scientists have actually been able to
create not just the map of the dark energy distribution but also the map of dark matter
which basically acts in the opposite way and so some of the most accurate dark matter maps we
have so far have actually been produced by this particular survey here's for example one of the
most recent maps produced by the survey from 2021 and so by comparing the maps from DES to the maps
from CMB the scientists realized that they too seem to match in the process discovering that this
particular region seems to have a lot less galaxies than a lot of other regions nearby
naturally also containing a lot less dark matter as well fitting the definition of what you would
call a void or in this case a super void and according to the scientists in this paper this
would be a gigantic structure empty structure it would be approximately 1.8 billion light years
across and would be located approximately 2 billion light years away from us which also
means that it's probably the nearest such super void to us or as it's referred to in the paper
the nearest under density to earth with the average density inside the void being approximately 30%
less than the density of mass and galaxies and so on around it and so once again it's not that it's
empty space it's actually not empty at all it just there's a lot less stuff on the inside
which is why it creates this cold spot visible right here but at the same time it also seems to
be cigar shaped or sausage shaped and we're basically looking at it from I guess this perspective
right here so we're sort of facing the tunnel in this case and although this does sort of explain
everything once and for all it doesn't explain one thing it doesn't explain the origins or how
such a huge structure was created and mostly because at the moment all of the models do not
produce any such extremely large structures it kind of suggests that either there is something
wrong with our current physical model of the universe or for some reason the universe decided
to produce this unusually anomalous object that's somewhat difficult to explain using modern physics
either way whatever the explanation is going to be in the next few years the paper itself is very
interesting and the finding in this case almost definitively proves that a redanus super void
is basically the largest such formation close to us and it's probably one of the biggest super
voids in the universe and actually most likely even closer to us as well it's also not in this
map right now mostly because this is a little bit outdated but for now we don't really know what's
happening inside the void and how it was formed maybe there was more dark energy present in this
region and so the universe expanded a little bit faster or maybe there are some other unexplained
phenomena happening inside the void that's causing these effects either way though it's
definitely going to be really interesting to find out what the explanation for this is in some of
the future studies for example one of the suggestions in the paper is that maybe there's
actually something going on with the slightly weaker gravitational landing effect that's
already been detected in the paper whatever it is the future will tell for now it's definitely
a great confirmation and a great explanation to an old mystery once we learn more there's going to
be a video so make sure to subscribe share this with someone who has learned about space and sciences
