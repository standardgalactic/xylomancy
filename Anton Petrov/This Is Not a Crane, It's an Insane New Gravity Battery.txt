Hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing what's known as a
gravity battery and specifically this right here this unusual looking tower that's in
reality a gravity battery something that a company known as energy volt has now actually developed
and is trying to sell to a lot of different bidders but more specifically we're going to
be discussing the idea behind these gravity batteries how they operate and more importantly
how they might transform the future of humanity but let's start small actually this small now
you might have seen a grandfather clock before but this is actually a good example of how humans
have learned to use gravity to operate something and to produce energy the pendulum in the clock
here generates all of its energy from essentially the gravity of planet earth and this idea of
gravity as energy allows us to produce things like for example hydro plants a hydro plant or a dam
operates entirely on the idea of gravity generating energy with the motion of water
generating energy by driving the turbines and not so long ago i actually went on a kind of a tour
trying to explore different ways energy is generated here in south korea because i
actually wanted to make a video about all of this unfortunately covid happened and so all of these
plants are currently off limits but during that time when i was exploring various plants i discovered
some really really awesome ideas and some really interesting constructions that are currently used
to either generate or store energy for example korea actually has the world's largest tidal wave
energy generator it generates energy through the tides and we'll talk more about this in some of
the future videos because i actually wanted to dedicate an entire video to this but by basically
using the tides to control the flow of water it's possible to generate a lot of energy in the same
way that it's usually done in a hydro plant or a dam and so a lot of countries around the world
right now are basically trying to find new ways to generate energy without the use of fossil fuels
that's obviously the priority for a lot of countries out there but generating energy is one
thing the other thing is how do you actually store it and storing energy especially renewable energy
is a completely different problem that currently does not have a very good solution and that's mostly
because a lot of renewable energies like solar energy or wind energy is not really constant it
usually deviates with time and sometimes depends on certain conditions for example solar energy
obviously does not work at night and so the only way to make this work is to collect a lot of energy
during the day and then store a lot of energy for the night time so that it can also be used at night
but this obviously requires a lot of batteries and an extremely efficient way of storing all of this
chemical batteries unfortunately are not good enough especially in certain climates such as
in extremely hot climates or extremely cold climates where chemical batteries usually discharge
very quickly and so during my mini tour of different power plants including nuclear power plants
i've got to talk to some experts who actually told me how a lot of this works and it's really
interesting how most of the countries solve this problem they usually rely on gravity for providing
extra battery storage and specifically they normally use sort of like the reverse of what a
typical hydro plant is it's known as psh pumped storage hydroelectricity and the idea is really
simple during daytime for example you use all of this extra energy to drive a lot of water uphill
and then store it in some sort of a reservoir on top normally this is done with some sort of a mountain
and some sort of a reservoir on top of the mountain with different countries using different
techniques for example here's a picture of a pump storage plant in lithuania that essentially
stores extra water right here in this reservoir and will then release the water when the energy is
required and here's another one from wales this has a very funky welsh name that i don't think i'm
going to try to pronounce and so once all of this water is collected some more on top at night the
flow reverses and all of this water can now generate extra electricity needed and so today
this is the most widely used gravity battery often used in conjunction with a lot of renewable
energy usually massive solar power plants but sometimes also wind power plants or a lot of
other power plants that require additional energy storage and generally speaking a lot of these
batteries are designed to work for at least 12 hours without stopping so basically they have
enough energy for approximately half a day and today there are quite a lot of them out there
approximately a third of them are in the united states with a total storage capacity of us alone
being approximately 250 gigawatt hours that's a lot of energy but there's another country that has
even more of them and that's switzerland and the reason why switzerland basically explains the
problem with this type of energy or this type of energy storage the type of a gravity generator
that we're talking about here requires mountains and it requires a lot of water without mountains
and water it would be extremely difficult to produce an efficient gravity battery or at least
a psh a pump storage hydroelectricity and so most countries with mountains and water usually
have no problem producing these which is why there are quite a lot of them in south korea a lot of
them in america and quite a lot of them in switzerland but if a country is more or less flat
or if it's a desert it becomes kind of impossible to produce this simply because there are just no
resources and it will be way more expensive to produce this than even a chemical type of a battery
and by the way fun fact but the first one of these batteries was originally produced in switzerland
as well back in 1907 so this is our super old technology and so anyway how do you solve this
if a country has no mountains and no water something else has to be used and that's where
these two new startups decided to solve this problem by producing something quite brilliant
actually and the first startup is energy volt and this is what their battery looks like and even
though it might not look like a battery it actually can store quite a lot of energy even more than
some of these hydroelectric ones and the design itself despite being kind of ugly is modifiable
and will most likely change in time okay so how exactly does this work and what exactly are they
trying to achieve here well in essence it's an automated crane that picks up various blocks
and stores them on top with these blocks acting as potential energy and so as extra energy is
generated by the wind turbines or by solar power plants all of this is stored and eventually
deposited right on top of the crane itself then during the night time for example or when there's
no wind it starts doing the opposite it starts to slowly bring all of these blocks down and thus
generates energy simply through the action of gravity pulling on all of these blocks and the
way that all of this is designed right now it's entirely automated and runs with almost no supervision
whatsoever and so instead of using water it uses either concrete or even some sort of a recycled
heavy material and interestingly enough it's able to store quite a lot of energy and it's also
able to produce quite a lot of energy when it needs to be produced so the capacity here is pretty high
with a total output of approximately 5 megawatt meaning that it can supply energy to a small town
and as you can see from this video they already have a first function in prototype currently
located in one of the cities in switzerland this tower is approximately 110 meters in height and
is able to move very massive concrete blocks approximately 35 ton each the total storage here
is approximately 80 megawatt hours of energy more importantly this company has officially signed
their first commercial deal meaning that they're going to be producing these for some of the energy
companies in europe and at the moment they're designed to be powered entirely by solar energy
and then store all of this energy for 910 years and from what we know so far the next tower is going
to be somewhere in louisiana with a total storage capacity of nearly 500 megawatt hour that's a lot
of storage it will be enough to power a somewhat small city and it's expected to start operating
sometime next year in 2022 and they also are planning to build at least one in ohio and at
least one in canada somewhere in british columbia so this is a super exciting project and i'm really
looking forward to seeing where all of this goes and interestingly this is even a little bit more
efficient than the psha previously mentioned unlike the hydroelectric energy storage this has
slightly more efficiency in terms of storing energy and in terms of then retrieving it from the
blocks themselves the overall efficiency here is approximately 85 versus about 75 for a hydroelectric
plant but that's not the only company doing this there's a company somewhere in the uk
known as gravitricity and they have a somewhat similar but a slightly different concept of
gravity energy they're planning to rely on abandoned very deep mine shafts usually several
kilometers in depth and instead of using a crane and a bunch of blocks they're going to be lowering
one single block deep into the mine shaft with the block itself being anywhere from about 500 to
even 5000 tons in mass and by essentially moving this block just a few centimeters deep into the
mine it's able to generate a tremendous amount of electricity or vice versa it's able to store a
tremendous amount of electricity as the block is lifted from the bottom with the current model
being able to store approximately 10 megawatt hour of energy but this particular project is still in
its infancy and is still looking for more investors specifically though it's also sort of reliant on
these abandoned mines so obviously only some countries are going to be able to produce this
nevertheless it shows us that this is a really exciting time for innovation and for a lot of
new technologies and a lot of new concepts that are going to be appearing just to help us transition
from the idea of fossil fuels and chemical energy to the idea of renewable energy and renewable
storage and so I'm actually kind of excited to see where all of this goes in the next five years
but I guess until we learn more or until some other company invents or designs something
else incredible that's all I wanted to mention you can find all the links for each of the companies
and their projects in the description below and subscribe if you still haven't shared this with
someone who has learned about space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something
else maybe support the channel patreon by joining a channel membership or by buying the
wonderful present teacher you can find in any description stay wonderful i'll see you tomorrow
and as always bye bye
Fuffes done I post patients
