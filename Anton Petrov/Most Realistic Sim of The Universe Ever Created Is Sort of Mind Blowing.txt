Hello and for person this is Anton and today we are going to be discussing the creation
of the most complex to date simulation of the entire universe. The simulation that was recently
created by the scientist in Japan that sort of dwarfs everything else that ever existed.
But I also wanted to discuss some of the previous simulations and what all this is for
and what the scientists are trying to discover by doing all of this over and over.
And let's actually start with some of the more basic simulations I've been using on the channel
for several years. The ones you can technically purchase and use yourselves. So for example
universe sandbox and the beautiful space engine are both meant to simulate the universe to some
extent. With both of them doing a pretty good job at least when it comes to smaller patches of the
universe such as for example taking a look at what happens in the solar system or trying to imagine
what a typical galaxy or possibly a global cluster looks like. But they both obviously have their
shortcomings. For space engine it's the fact that things here are more or less static. So for
example a star system is not going to be interacting with another star system. And so in this global
cluster for example nothing is actually moving anywhere. Everything here is more or less in
the same spot. Now that's obviously because of the limitations and the inability to potentially
simulate this on grandiose scales like what we have right here. Now universe sandbox does
almost the opposite. It tries to simulate the gravitational interactions between various objects
but depending on how powerful your computer is even here you're going to start reaching your
limitations pretty quickly. So in this simulation once these moons start to collide and start creating
more particles that's when my computer can no longer really handle it. But when it comes to
actual scientific simulations normally this required a supercomputer because of the limitations
you can clearly see right here. And so in the last decade or so a lot of different scientific
teams started to create their own simulations such as this one right here known as the universe
machine that try to use as many cores as possible in order to create the most realistic simulation
of as many objects as possible interacting as they would in real life. And every few years these
so-called universes in a box or universes in a bottle have improved so dramatically and have
improved so much that the effects they're showing us in real time allow the scientists to
discover various features of galactic and star formation that they actually did not know existed.
And in the last few years I've been using a lot of these videos like the one you see right here
that were originally created back in 2019 by the biggest and the most complex simulation of the
universe in the box. This is known as the illustrious project. This project is freely
available on the website in the description and the cool thing here is that if you were to click
on the explorer you sort of get the snapshot of one of these simulations where you can sort of
zoom in and see one of the extremely detailed simulations of one of these universes in a box.
That also allows you to change various properties of what you're actually looking at
and allows you to visualize what a lot of the interaction between galaxies usually ends up
producing. Now I've previously discussed this project and the simulation in the video from
approximately two years ago but just to summarize the biggest simulation to date involves creating
a tiny universe that's approximately 230 million light years across and contained tens of thousands
of different galaxies with a tremendous amount of detail and a lot of interacting particles.
Here there was approximately 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gas, stars and a lot
of supermassive black holes. With the actual simulation lasting around 13.8 billion years
representing the age of the universe and the point of the simulation was to try to build a
representation of the universe as it evolved since the beginning of the Big Bang allowing the scientists
to visualize how all of these structures interact and what exactly they end up forming both in terms
of large-scale structures but also in terms of the smaller interactions and small structures inside
of every galaxy. Now to produce this the obviously as I mentioned before required a supercomputer.
In this case it used 16,000 different cores and it's known as the Hazel Hunt supercomputer located
in Germany and to create all this it required the scientists approximately a year of continuous
calculations. According to them if I were to use my computer to do this it would take me approximately
15,000 years but because of these simulations and the actual representation of the universe
this allowed them to discover several major phenomena that essentially involved a lot of
the interaction between various types of particles in this model universe. For example one of the
major discoveries as you can kind of see in this simulation is a surprisingly common formation
of various disc-shaped galaxies. They seem to be way more common than we originally anticipated.
With many of these galaxies also containing things like spiral arms, things like bulges and even
various galactic bars extending across the galaxy. More importantly some of the more unknown discoveries
were actually in regards to the interaction between supernova explosions and the activity from
supermassive black holes. Here it was all in regards to various types of outflow of gas
that created a kind of feedback loop with the gas being kicked out of the galaxy through supernova
and supermassive black holes just to then return back into the galaxy to feed the black hole and
create more supernova once again. Normally this is how we believe a lot of galaxies form today
and how they evolve over time. And interestingly enough a lot of these phenomena discovered
were absolutely not programmed into the simulation. This sort of just happened naturally
and that's because of the complexity of the simulation itself, because of the number of
particles and also because of the time it represented in this simulation of the universe.
But now the Japanese scientists took it a step further. Okay like a really big step further.
Introducing the Japanese project they refer to as Uju, which is Japanese for outer space.
And this project is, well it's basically illustrious but like on steroids, it's illustrious times 100
and I'm not exaggerating this. It literally involves two trillion different particles.
And it also represents a universe that's around 9.6 billion light years across. It's bigger,
it's more complex and it's way way more advanced than illustrious was ever able to produce.
Now let me just show you the part of the simulation that was released by the scientists
that you can also find in the link in the description below. And so what you're looking at
right here is basically the interaction between a lot of these particles and the creation of the
once again universe in the box. But this time a tremendously massive universe. A universe that is
almost exactly the same size as the actual observable universe. Just a little bit smaller.
And honestly this is absolutely mind blowing. So we don't really know what's going to be
discovered here just yet. Mostly because the whole point of this was just to create a simulation.
But chances are a lot of incredible discoveries are going to be made once the data from this
is analyzed. And once the scientists start to look deep into what actually was created
by a lot of these particles interacting. And interestingly even the scientists themselves
refer to this as a kind of a time machine. Here you can go forward, you can go backward,
you can stop time, you can zoom in, you can choose a single galaxy, you can choose a single
galactic cluster and you can basically do anything you want with it and investigate anything you want
just to discover various properties created in this unusual and somewhat realistic universe.
And what makes this I guess to some extent more exciting especially for amateur scientists or
amateur astronomers is that all this is freely available to download. But it's not just like a
simulation you can download like Space Engine. It does require a little bit of knowledge in
terms of data retrieval and also a little bit of knowledge in terms of data processing as well.
And so for example in order to access something like this and to be able to see what the scientists
saw in their simulation you would first have to access the data through this publicly available
data set right here. With I guess the easiest way to do this being the github page right here
which has a collection of different Python tools and Jupyter notebooks that have several examples
and several commands that you can use especially if you have knowledge of Python with the basics
on how to install this and how to use this available in there as well. But because this
data represents approximately 100 terabytes of data it would be very very difficult to download
all of this and to try to recreate this on your own computer. And so to try to recreate something
like this it would require a little bit of data processing and the ability to create visualizations
using the available data. And so there are no actual videos available just yet. But ultimately
one day hopefully someone is going to be able to produce something similar to Space Engine
by using the data collected from these various studies allowing us to go into any time frame
and allowing us to zoom in on any of these objects in order to see some of these most
incredible and most detailed representations of different objects in the universe. So in this
particular case the simulation was able to create something that was only a few light years across.
Many of us in theory should be able to see various star systems and possibly even certain planets.
But to be honest to create something like this as an actual simulation similar to Space Engine
might never really be possible simply because of the complexity of things involved here. Now
it'll be great if someone did it but chances are it will never happen mostly because the actual
commercial technology is just not there yet. We might be able to have a lot of visualizations
and a lot of videos similar to this one but we're not probably going to have a Space Engine like
exploration tool for quite a while. Now hopefully someone proves me wrong but chances are we're
going to be limited to just looking at the data or looking at videos. Either way though it's
still quite impressive at what the sciences were able to achieve using the computer you see right
here known as Atterui 2 the most powerful supercomputer when it comes to astronomical
simulations. Now one intriguing feature coming out of this simulation is the fact that they mostly
focused on the idea of dark matter and so in this simulation the mysterious halos of dark matter
more or less control what you see forming and notice how the actual formation does seem to
resemble the actual universe we observe in real life as well which of course implies that well
maybe dark mirror halos exist after all. At the same time the purpose of the simulation is to
actually try to see the future as well or essentially try to see the eventual fate of the universe.
Now it's obviously not entirely clear what exactly is going to happen to the universe from
this simulation and the scientists have not really mentioned anything just yet but I'm sure a lot of
future studies investigating the last moments of the simulation might be able to show us what's
going to happen to a lot of galactic clusters a lot of different large formations including of
course galaxies and a lot of other mysterious formations such as the extremely massive cosmic
web and in case you're wondering the supercomputer contained over 40 000 different computer cores
and also took over a year to generate approximately three petabytes of data that were then converted
to 100 terabytes of data that can be easily analyzed using python and so it's sort of
mind blowing to know that hypothetically you could download the entire universe and it's only
about 100 terabytes in size and since this is approximately 100 times more advanced than the
previously mentioned illustrious project I can only imagine what we're going to achieve in the next
five or even ten years for all we know we might be able to create a universe that physically
contains actual planets and moons and potentially even has a lot of other interactions on the surface
as well now this is obviously something we might be able to create in the future and in theory nothing
is really stopping us from getting there but for now in 2021 this right here is the best we have
a universe that's about 9 billion light years across and that represents approximately 13
point billion years of evolution it contains approximately 2 trillion particles with each
of the particles representing something different possibly a part of the star possibly some sort
of a gas or maybe a black hole and so definitely a really impressive achievement by the way you
can learn more about all of this from the paper in the description below and so I guess for now
that's sort of all I wanted to mention although maybe there's one more thing the idea of a universe
as a simulation and I'm sure someone in the comments is going to mention this does this actually
prove that maybe we live in an actual supercomputer simulation created by something else well to some
extent there's really no way to prove this and to other extent what we're creating with these
simulations like the space engine or the one I just showed you the one known as Uchu it doesn't
necessarily represent everything we know about the universe for example it does not at all simulate
the idea of particle physics it also completely ignores the idea of quantum physics this mostly
shows us the interaction between various particles influencing each other gravitationally and so
because of this it still is extremely simple compared to what we actually have as a reality
and where we live and trying to simulate this would be almost impossible just the fact that we
have to simulate quantum physics and the idea of particles being in different places at different
times that would be almost impossible that's something we cannot achieve even using some of
the most complex computers on the planet right now and so since there is no actual way to prove or
disprove this I'm just going to leave this as a kind of a philosophical question but in my opinion
it's very likely that we do not live in a simulation and there are actually some really
strong arguments against that and we'll talk about some of these in some of the future videos
