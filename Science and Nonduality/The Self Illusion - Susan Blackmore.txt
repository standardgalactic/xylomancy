Let me turn to the self, because that's what I'm supposed to be talking about.
I would say the self is an illusion.
What do I mean by illusion?
I don't mean, and like Dan Dennis and other people who are interested in illusions,
you get accused of saying it doesn't exist.
The Buddha had this trouble, didn't he?
To some people he would say, of course the self exists,
and to other people he'd say, no, there's no self.
I think the point about this is,

Poed. It's very natural. It seems to be the way we're built that we feel as...
o, there's my foot. That's my foot. That's my knee. That's my tummy and I'm in here looking at the one I look.
They say I'm up here and I'm looking at my foot and I'm over here and you're out there.
That's a kind of natural way that we feel about ourselves.
But of course it's rubbish. There is not only no armchair, but there isn't any place in the brain.
This is what Dandenic calls the Cartesian Theatre.

that there's me inside here doing it.
Give rise therefore to understanding a little bit about what it might mean,
to say that I am an illusion or the self as an illusion.
It feels this way but it really isn't.
It feels I submit, but I'm pleased, argue for many of you,
it may not feel this way with an audience like this of people
who generally done a lot of meditation, mindfulness, exploration.
Oh, here I am, seems to be me, seems to be one me, one me in charge of this body.
Unified, continuous, it seems to be, well it doesn't anymore actually,
but it used to seem to be that it was me a few minutes ago and before that it was me and the little girl and so on,
that there was something continuous about the me's generated by this brain and this body.
It seems to be that there's a me having a stream of experiences.
And it seems to be that I have some effect on my body.
I can say, I can raise my hand and I did it.
Now, there's plenty of psychological evidence, fascinating stuff, that's just an illusion.
We have thoughts, no really, really, I mean, Libet's work is just the start.
We have thoughts about an action say, the action happens, there's a correlation, they're in that order.
We jump to the conclusion that one caused the other, but we can tell from what's going on in the brain that it isn't like that at all.
Indeed, we know so much now about the mechanisms of self-control, of decision making, of choices and so on,
and where they're happening in prefrontal cortex and so on, again distributed and so on,
that the idea of there being a me who initiates actions is just bonkers, but it still feels that way.
OK, the science, I think, is therefore very helpful, because it goes on banging here, you're not in there.
There's just this stuff, you know, doing something, whatever it is, and we don't even know fundamentally what it is.
So, I mean, I've said that already, there's no where in there, where it all comes together.
There's just all this massive parallel processing going on causing this body to these words to come out,
and this body not to crash into the pretty flowers.
So, let's take a different tack.
Let's say, are you going to come and do something to me again?
Later.
Let's say I sit in meditation and look for myself.
Or I could do Douglas Harding kind of thing, couldn't I?
I look for the person who's looking and what do I find?
I find the world.
I can't go round and round.
I don't find myself as I thought it was.
I don't find a consistent experiencer of the experiences.
I find help, I don't know, instead.
I want to tell you a little bit about some simple explorations.
I want one particular exploration, actually, and then I'll kind of wind up with some,
explaining why I called the talk when I did call it.
Years ago, I used to teach a consciousness course in Bristol.
I did it for about ten years, and it resulted in the textbook that I wrote about consciousness.
And I don't know how I got into it, but it happened very early on, probably in the first year,
that I started to get the students to ask a question every week.
They had to ask it hundreds of times, as many times as they could every day.
It's amazingly difficult to get them to do it, and they'd all come and say,
Oh, I forgot.
And then they put stickers on the kettle and stickers on the door
and prod each other in pairs to make them remember and all kinds of tricks.
Still hard.
I don't know why it's so hard it is.
By the way, are you conscious now?
Well.
Of course.
I love the ones who say, of course, that confidence.
I also like the ones shaking their heads.
I don't like the people who don't say anything.
Are you conscious now?
Great.
We love a lovely mixture of yes and no.
Now, there's a very, very interesting thing about this question.
This is question number one in week number one of this 20 week course.
Are you conscious now?
You've just walked in.
Are you conscious now?
Doesn't know.
The odd thing about this question is,
I know there were some of you saying no,
and there are various interesting reasons why you might be saying no.
But normally, basically, if you ask,
am I conscious now, the answer is always yes.
Did any of you get the odd sensation when I asked you,
are you conscious now, of sort of,
kind of becoming, yeah?
It's like, oh, you're becoming conscious because I've asked you.
Yeah?
Something like that.
Now, this can be very puzzling.
Because you think to yourself,
well, of course I was conscious before,
but then something happened that was different.
What changed?
It felt like I was becoming conscious,
but does that mean I wasn't conscious before?
It's a very odd thing.
Not all of you will have had it,
but perhaps if I tap you on the back later on,
you're not being very mindful.
Was I conscious before?
So this took me to my next question.
This, by the way, I wrote a book about this,
which was originally called Ten Zen Questions,
and then they decided to bring the paper back out
and change the title, which is really irritating.
So don't go and buy both books because they're the same.
And it really annoys me,
but it's a much more trendy title, isn't it,
Zen and the Art of Consciousness?
That peculiar thing that you experienced
than a few other people did led me to the second question.
What was I conscious of a moment ago?
I would like you all to ask yourself that question now.
What was I conscious of a moment ago?
Now, I don't know if this works for any of you.
It took me a long time for this to stabilise,
and I mean a long time.
When I was writing this book,
some of the chapters are based on co-un retreats
with other people, organised co-un retreats.
Most of them are based on the solitary retreats,
which I did on my own,
either up in the Welsh mountains or at home.
And I would ask the same question,
hour after hour, day after day,
based on a simple Zen meditation.
Calm the mind for quite a while
and just let the question calm when it comes.
What was I conscious of a moment ago?
OK, I've just done it now.
Now, the obvious thought would be,
I was conscious of the words coming out of my mouth,
because surely I must have been thinking about them,
because giving a lecture, you know,
you need a bit of attention.
But I can hear that humming noise over there
as though somebody's been listening.
Hang on, I was sort of faintly aware of a man nodding over there.
I'd forgotten.
If I hadn't asked myself the question,
that would have gone.
But it sort of feels as though,
well, there was somebody listening to that noise over there,
but it wasn't me,
because I was concentrating on what I was saying.
When I was doing this out in the wilds of the mountains,
I would get this sense,
or it was more interesting when I was doing it at home,
have a meditation hut in the garden.
Because I was, what was I conscious of a moment ago?
And multiple parallel threads would be obvious.
I hadn't even noticed, because I'm just sitting.
There's a great drilling going on in the road.
But when I asked that question,
it's as though somebody was listening to the drilling.
Who was it?
Somebody was aware of my bottom sitting on the cushion,
and the cat's been purring for ages.
In fact, I kind of remember the cat turning up and curling up next to me.
All of these things, when I look backwards,
so what's going on?
Now, this is where that's the experience, okay?
But I'm now jumping to an intellectual interpretation
of the experience that might be wrong.
It's always dangerous to do that.
But my interpretation, I tried inventing this little graphic this morning,
which doesn't quite do it justice,
but what I'm thinking is something like this.
Most of the time, most of our lives,
most of the time, what's happening is what you'd expect
in a complex brain, in a complex body, in a complex world.
There are multiple parallel streams going along,
and none of them is in consciousness or out of consciousness.
None of them is what I am experiencing or I'm not experiencing.
They're all just going along, some bigger than others,
and that's what these lines are.
Some are ephemeral, very short-lived, some are rather longer,
some maybe they're ourselves.
Maybe this one, there's a kind of a bit of a self-construct going along,
and we know where these self-constructs are made,
and the temporal parietal junction is the body image made,
and so on.
So we can track those things if we wanted to.
But what I'm suggesting is there might even be two in parallel.
There might be several in parallel, the coming and going, shifting,
but then you ask the question, am I conscious now?
Or any question you like that propels you into mindfulness.
And then what happens?
All the rest come over there, and they're all brought together,
and you go, oh, here I am, and that's fine.
If I make the mistake, this is where the delusion comes about of going,
and I was conscious before, and I've been conscious all day.
Somebody mentioned that in a lecture this morning,
just with utter confidence, oh, I've been conscious all the time.
I submit that you haven't.
And every time this happens, which will be many, many times a day
if you're practicing something like mindfulness
and falling out of mindfulness,
then, if you're mindful all the time, then you're staying like this,
then if you keep popping back into it,
you think it's the same self,
or at least that's the delusionary way of thinking about it.
Mindfulness is very interesting,
because I suspect that in the beginning what happens in mindfulness
is that you bring up this self, I am being mindful,
and that's that transition there.
And you can keep the self for a long time with practice of mindfulness.
But I think what happens later on in mindfulness practice
is that this self drops out,
and possibly awareness can remain of this parallel state
in which there isn't a self,
and then one is seeing clearly only there isn't a self to see clearly,
rather there is just experiences without an experiencer.
But that's really another issue.
So, what happened in the last half an hour or so?
There was a me, because I got quite nervous
because there was a problem with wires,
and I'm thinking,
there's a me, and full away.
And there's another one.
And then there's another one.
And then there's a whole distracted gap with a whole lot of things going,
oh, and here I am again.
But I'm not, this thing here is not conned into thinking it's the same me.
Partly because of the science,
and partly because of the personal enquiry,
I say that wasn't the same me.
And looking forward into the future,
it won't be the same me either.
In a few minutes I'll be,
oh, no, in a few minutes I'll be answering your questions, I hope,
and should a me pop up and a sensation of I'm over here and you're over there
and I'm going to answer the questions,
that will be a new me.
She won't be me, this one.
How do we live with this?
If it's true, it may not be.
I really like, this is my kind of scientist nature coming out.
Have an idea, have a hypothesis, we'll go and test it.
Right, okay, I'll go and live my life like this
and see how it works out and what happens.
And if I'm wrong, someone can prove me wrong
and I'll change your mind, do something else, equally daft maybe.
But how do we live with this?
One little trick I've discovered,
and I would love to hear from other people,
if any of you have been doing anything similar, is this.
It is...
I'm going to just discuss three things about it.
It's learning to let go of her.
This is very tricky,
because as long as I feel that this is me,
I want to carry on.
And there's another interesting intellectual question, why?
Why do cells want to carry on?
Why are they so greedy to exist, anywhere they are?
So, a practice that I've been doing is,
whenever there's a feeling of, here I am, am I conscious now?
Yes, here I am.
I think and willing to not be.
In any way, it's only like going to sleep at night, isn't it?
I mean, you lie down, you think,
I'm going to stop existing until the morning,
and that's kind of why going to sleep is such a weird thing.
But it's sort of the same, going to sleep while awake,
or disappearing, dying, if you like.
Just, ah, she's allowed to go.
Importantly, similar to in meditation,
the dealing with thoughts, it's not go away.
It's not, oh, here I am, go away.
No, no, oh, here I am, oh.
I'll go away at some point.
Letting her go away.
That's, I think, quite helpful.
It's also part of this kind of comparison
between before and after the question.
The unified, mindful state of being me experiencing stuff,
and the kind of normal everyday parallel processing distracted state.
Looking back into that,
it reminds me of one of my favourite quotes from William James,
who is my great, great hero.
He tried a lot of introspection,
and he said introspection of this kind
is like trying to turn up the gas quickly enough
to see how the darkness looks.
Of course, he'd have electricity now.
It would be much quicker, wouldn't it?
And you can't look into the darkness by shining the light.
Was that any time left or stop now?
Ah, brilliant, thank you.
So this is an attempt, if you like, to look into the darkness,
but I can't look into the darkness.
But by letting myself go, as it were, her,
whoever she is, this one who appears,
maybe the darkness can become light.
So that's one little trick.
But one might reasonably have a question about,
I call it morality, but I'm not sure,
I couldn't think of a better word,
but if she won't be me, then why should I care?
I mean, if it's not going to be me in the future
who's going to suffer the pain or the joy or whatever it is,
then why should I care about what happens?
Why should I do anything? Why should I act?
Now, I think many of you would say,
well, you don't actually, and I agree, one doesn't.
It's not me who acts, neither scientifically nor experientially.
Actions happen, or to quote another Buddhist thing,
actions exist and also their consequences,
but the person that acts does not.
But then why should I care?
Well, I think the reason, I'm concerned about this really,
because why do I care about her this afternoon if she's not me?
Well, she's kind of similar to me,
and we'll have similar memories
and similar tendencies to behave,
because after all, she's going to be constructed,
an illusion constructed by this body.
Maybe that's the reason.
But I think actually more generally,
it's only the same as, you know, in general,
I see suffering all around in the world,
and kind of I'd rather people didn't suffer.
And the same for these selves in the future.
And this thing here has some capacity
to determine at least the pleasures and sufferings
of the similar selves that will come in the future
more than I can do anything for the rest of you.
So maybe that's enough.
But also I feel a kind of gratitude towards previous selves
that put me here.
I had a lovely time last night.
I went out after dinner in the woods and it was nearly dark.
It was a bit silly of me,
because coming back through the woods in the nearly dark
was poking my eyes with stick, you know, trees and what have you.
But it was wonderful out there.
I was marching round and round the trees,
thinking what I'm going to say today.
And I think a sort of mutual gratitude between the prior,
the previous and the future selves
is also kind of encouraging to, you know,
nice behaviour rather than nasty behaviour.
And what about death?
Well, all I've been describing
is allowing oneself to die again and again all the time.
So in that sense, it's only the same, isn't it?
When the body finally goes,
well, all of these rather similar selves will stop,
but hey, they were all stopping anyway.
They were all being let go.
And this bugbear about reincarnation,
like so many western scientists
interested in Buddhism and related ideas,
reincarnation does seem stupid.
What on earth is going to be reincarnated?
It's all about.
I get in trouble.
I've had an email thing on one of my blogs
with a Buddhist teacher, you know,
getting really angry with me, and I say,
I'm not a Buddhist and I can say what I like, actually.
And so can you.
And that's fine.
But why I think it's daft
is because what I've described as selves
can't be reincarnated as nothing personal.
So what is all this stuff about the cycle of birth and death?
Or rebirth? What's that about then?
Well, here's a very different interpretation.
Yes, it is. It's actually a very straightforward insight
into what it is to be alive.
It's constantly dying and being born again,
selves arising and falling away.
And so long as you believe that it's the same self
and it's continuous and unitary
and has powers and does things
and is in charge of its body and all of that,
you're still stuck in all of that delusion.
But if you just go, oh, here it comes, here it goes, you're not.
Could that be something about what
getting off the rebirth thing is about?
I don't know. I throw that in as a pure speculation.
But let me go back to where I was.
These selves just pop up.
Oh, here's another one.
And she'll be about to say goodbye
and I hope that makes sense of why I called it
She Won't Be Me.
Thank you.
