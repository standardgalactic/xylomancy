Hi and welcome. I am Victor Gijsbers and I teach philosophy at Leiden University
in the Netherlands. In this video I want to take a look at the article Two
Dogmas of Empiricism written by the American philosopher Willard van
Almen Kwan. Two Dogmas of Empiricism is a famous article. Indeed it has often been
said to be the most important or most influential article written in 20th
century philosophy or at least 20th century analytic or 20th century anglophone philosophy.
So what we want to do when we take a look at Two Dogmas of Empiricism is of course
we want to understand what Kwan is saying but we also want to understand why it is so famous,
why it had such an enormous influence even though Kwan himself when he wrote it
you know thought of it as like definitely not his best work as as kind of hasty kind of sketchy
nevertheless despite that Two Dogmas of Empiricism was seen as a sea change in 20th century philosophy.
Okay so let's look at that. I want to start out by reading the first few sentences of the
article because it gives us a very good overview of what Kwan is going to do.
Modern empiricism has been conditioned in large part by Two Dogmas. Now when Kwan talks about
modern empiricism I think he is talking about basically his own 20th century precursors but
we will say a bit more about that later. Modern empiricism has been conditioned in large part
by Two Dogmas. One is a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are analytic or
grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact and truths which are synthetic or grounded
in fact. The other dogma is reductionism the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to
some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience. Both dogmas I shall argue
are ill founded. One effect of abandoning them is as we shall see a blurring of the supposed
boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science. Another effect is a shift towards
pragmatism. So what Kwan does is he sets the context. The context is modern empiricism and again
I'm going to come back to that. Then he tells us that he is going to attack two ideas. The first
idea is this distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. The second idea is what he
calls reductionism and specifically it's the idea that every sentence or at least every meaningful
sentence I suppose that every meaningful sentence can be sort of reconstructed in terms of a pure
observation language. So it can be reconstructed in terms that have only to do with things that we
can observe and don't have anything to do with things that we can't observe or you know that we
could only sort of partially observe. So no sort of theoretical terms which would be maybe things
like electron or supernova but I guess also even things like like table maybe right when I say that
there's a table here then at least one way of understanding that sentence is to claim that it
says something not about like fundamentally it says something not about a physical object
but about certain observations that I could make certain sense experiences that I could have.
That's the kind of idea that that is Kwan's second dogma. The idea that any sentence
can be translated into a sentence that talks only about direct observations. So that's what
Kwan is going to attack and what is that going to lead to? It's going to lead to two things.
It's going to lead to first of all something that Kwan is going to call not in this article but that
he is going to call at some point a naturalized epistemology. So the idea that that philosophy
is actually sort of much closer to the natural sciences much more apart even of the natural
sciences maybe than we then we use to think and a shift towards pragmatism and we're going to
to look at that too. Okay so I think the right way to proceed is to focus first on this analytic
synthetic distinction because that's what most of the article is about and that is mostly also
what people think of when they think of two dogmas of empiricism. When you ask people well what
does Kwan do into dogmas of empiricism they say that he attacks or even that he defeats the analytic
synthetic distinction. So we're going to focus on the analytic synthetic distinction. I first want
to say something about what it is and then I want to consider how you could attack a distinction
and then we're going to look in a little bit more detail at what Kwan is doing and what sort of the
overall shape of the article is because it is in many ways a very strange shape. It's a shape that
actually doesn't fit the canonical idea of how to write good analytic philosophy very well at all.
Okay so what are analytic and synthetic statements? Well here Kwan is in a little bit of a bind
because he needs to explain to us like briefly what analytic and synthetic are supposed to mean
even though he's going to attack this distinction and sort of ask us to reject it later on.
Well roughly speaking we could think of something like this right an analytic statement is true
just because of the meaning of the terms and a synthetic statement is true because of the way
the world is right so not just because of the meaning of the terms that is sort of the rough
like first sketch of what this distinction is supposed to be. Now Kwan then brings in Kant
and he tells us that you know Kant gives a definition in terms of containment and he says
well that's not really helpful that that only works for a very particular kind of statement
but Kant's intent can be restated thus right I'm in the beginning of section one now.
Kant's intent can be restated thus. A statement is analytic when it is true by virtue of meanings
and independently of fact. Okay that's basically what I just said. I want to emphasize at this
point that that Kwan's encounter with Kant here is not really in any sense a serious encounter
with Kant and actually I think that Kwan would agree. I think that Kwan would agree that he hasn't
really done the work on Kant and I think we can and that he doesn't even really desire to do the
work on Kant and I think we can see that from three things which all of which are actually
kind of important to point out so I want to take a little bit of time explaining why Kwan and Kant
aren't really sort of talking to each other here not in order to tell you that Kwan should have read
Kant better or something like that but because it illuminates what Kwan is doing and what Kwan
isn't doing it illuminates the background so here's the first sign that Kwan isn't really talking to
Kant in this article it's the title two dogmas of empiricism now whatever Kant is Kant is definitely
not an empiricist right so immediately we can sort of see that that the philosophers that
Kwan has in mind well Kant is not really going to be one of them okay here's the second sign
very important for understanding the Kwan's article. Kant famously introduces the distinction
between analytic and synthetic to give an extra and independent dimension to a discussion that
already has the terms a priori and a posteriori right so already people are talking about the
a priori and the a posteriori that which I can know independently of experience and that which I
can only know based on experience or justify independently of experience and justify based
on experience um and Kant adds the analytic synthetic distinction in order to create sort
of four possibilities and thereby create the possibility to talk about the synthetic a priori
so claims that we can know independently of experience but that do have real content that
are not just about meanings that don't follow from the principle of non-contradiction as Kant might
tell us this is absolutely crucial for understanding Kant it is not in the Kwan article right Kwan
does not make a distinction between on the one hand the a priori and the a posteriori and on the
other hand the analytic and the synthetic right for Kwan to be analytic is to be um knowable
independently of experience and to be synthetic is to be true well it depends on fact right a
synthetic statement is something that depends on the facts and of course the facts are things that
we can only find out through experience that's not what Kant would say at all right I mean for
Kant the most important synthetic truths the synthetic a priori truths can be known independently
of experience they're not based on any facts in any you know sort of sort of normal sense of the
word fact at the very least so this is something to keep in mind for Kwan analytic synthetic is
basically the same as a priori a posteriori um and it's also basically the same as necessary and
contingent right all of those distinctions sort of run together in the way that Kwan is is thinking
here and of course that has to do with the fact that the philosophers that he has in mind the
empiricists that he's talking about and that will be people like the logical positivists people like
Carnop um that that they agree that there is no such thing as the synthetic a priori okay so that's
important third thing that I want to say about Kant and Kwan um is that Kant actually doesn't say
the kinds of things that that Kwan makes him say here right can't conceive of an analytic statement
as one that blah blah blah blah can't think that a statement is analytic when blah blah blah blah
um Kant isn't talking about statements when Kant introduces the analytic synthetic distinction
he talks about analytic and synthetic judgments right and a statement um you know that's some
kind of verbal utterance or maybe it's a sentence um a judgment you know the most reasonable way
maybe to think of that is to think of it as some kind of mental act right so it's not really the
same thing um and I think this is important and I think this is important I want to say a little
bit about why I think it is important so Kwan is going to end up saying at the very end of the
article that we can keep that we can you know believe the truth or sort of um keep keep affirming
the truth of any claim we want provided that we are willing to make changes in our beliefs elsewhere
so Kwan is going to end up and that is sort of the one of the pragmatist elements I guess
he's going to wind up saying that you know based on on what works for us we have a choice
in which statements we want to sort of make immune to criticism and which we want to be open
to criticism by experience so there's a sort of choice in a sense uh about what are the analytic
statements and what are the synthetic statements and Kant doesn't think that at all and so it might
seem that Kant and Kwan are sort of in in in conflict right fundamentally in conflict
but let's think about this example here is Kant and Kant says that it is a synthetic
a priori truth that all events have causes right and the a priori part is not so important for us
now uh it's synthetic right all events have a cause that's a synthetic claim according to Kant um
so it doesn't follow from the meaning of the terms alone and Kant emphasizes that it's not
part of the meaning of the term event that it is caused okay and so it's a synthetic statement and
so if it's true you know I can't see that from the concepts alone I've got to sort of show it
and Kant goes to great length to show it now here is what Aquinian might say Aquinian might say no
no no Kant that's that's not the way this works I mean you can also take this to be an analytic
statement or at least you can take this to be a statement that is immune I mean that that that
you can just hold on to without having to do any kind of of investigation um basically by making it
sort of the definition of an event right I can always hold on to the claim that all events are
caused even if let's say an experience I find a lot of things that are not caused if I'm
willing to say well then those are not events right they're something else they're happenings
so I can always do that right it's always possible to keep a hold of any claim and allow any kind
of experience to come in as long as you are willing to make changes elsewhere so there is a sense in
which Aquinian could say well all events have a cause you know that could be something that
is you know just true in a sense by virtue of meaning in the sense that we can choose to keep
it true no matter what happens or we can also choose to sort of make it respondent to new evidence
now why do I bring in this example because I think it illustrates the difference between a
statement and a judgment right I mean yes you can keep the same statement the statement all events
have a cause and either treat it as immune to revision or as not immune to revision but it's
not immediately clear that in those two scenarios you are using the statement to express the same
judgment right if I say something like all events have a cause that's true because that's my definition
of event well then when I'm claiming that all events have a cause I'm probably making a different
judgment than the judgment I'm making when I say all events have a cause and not treating that as a
merely sort of verbal truth okay so so there are some complications here and I think we need to keep
this in mind I mean Aquinus is a philosopher who is beyond the linguistic term so to speak I mean he
is conceiving all of this in deeply linguistic terms and Kant doesn't and so one of the things that
that one would have to wonder is whether thinking about the relation between statements and beliefs
or statements and judgments is going to sort of change the way that we approach Aquin's story
Aquin doesn't think so for Aquin the linguistic items are sort of the fundamental thing
and you know we don't have a hold of our things like beliefs unless we tie them to
verbal behavior and statements in some way but we don't have to to agree with that
all right okay so what is Quine going to do? Quine is going to attack this analytic synthetic
distinction now what I would like to do is I would like to walk you through a couple of ways
in which you could attack a distinction and then ask what Quine is actually doing okay so I have a
couple of examples of ways in which you can attack a distinction because this can mean so many things
so here's one thing suppose that somebody says there are two kinds of books good books and bad
books well that's a distinction that you could attack by saying no no look there's a whole spectrum
between good and bad there are also kind of okay books and so so books and slightly bad books and so
you are making this sort of false claim because you well I mean there's nothing sort of fundamentally
wrong with the distinction as long as we keep in mind that there's a whole spectrum between the good
and the bad right that's one way to attack a distinction to point out that there's a spectrum
and that people have been ignoring that here's a second way of attacking a distinction you could
say that actually there's just a false dichotomy so if somebody says you are either for us or against us
then I might say no I'm I'm not for you and I'm not against you I just don't care about you at all
right that seems possible so that would be to convict the distinction of being a false dichotomy
a third term or maybe more terms need to be added okay now both of these two
ways of attacking a distinction actually just keep the distinction they accept it but they add more
stuff um here's a third way maybe to attack a distinction it is to say that it's in a sense
arbitrary how things are classified according to the distinction so suppose that we take the
distinction between the fashionable and the unfashionable I mean that's a real distinction
some things are fashionable like my clothes are super fashionable um so it's a real distinction
but of course it's also kind of arbitrary in in 10 years time people will say well what was that
Heisberg's guy wearing um that's a way to attack a distinction to say that it's sort of arbitrary
and thereby maybe of little use for philosophy could do that something like that
we could also say that you know we can attack a distinction by suggesting that we can never
really use it because we are unable to classify things we don't have the right knowledge so a
skeptic attacks the distinction between true statements and false statements on precisely
that grounds right a skeptic will say that we don't know which of the statements are the true
ones and which are the false ones and that makes us sort of unable to apply this distinction
that is that is already a little bit more fundamental right I mean to say that that there's
a spectrum or that a third or fourth term needs to be added that keeps the distinction firmly in
place to say that it is either you know just sort of contingent and therefore not much use
or that we can't actually apply it because we don't have the right knowledge or the right skills
that sort of suggests that maybe we're better off without using it that's more fundamental
finally I would like to look at at two ways of attacking a distinction that that would sort of
destroy it if that's if that's the right word to use um you could for instance say that
the classes distinguished by the distinction don't even exist so if somebody says there are two
kinds of people there are just saved and a damned well if I don't believe in an afterlife then I'm
going to say no there are no saved and there are no damned right I mean this distinction is
um it doesn't apply because the distinction doesn't actually exist in reality that's a very
fundamental way of trying to get rid of a distinction or I could say that although you know I understand
the terms and they do apply there's actually no distinction because it's the same thing
so somebody says it's very important to make a distinction between on the one hand
racists and on the other hand ethno-nationalists then I might be tempted to say that no it's not
important to make a distinction between racists and ethno-nationalists um because ethno-nationalist
is just a nice word for racist right I mean there's there's no real distinction there okay so we have
seen six ways of trying to attack a distinction two of them that sort of accept it but want to add
more stuff two of them that say that we can't actually use it it's it's or or it's useless
and two of them that say that either there is no distinction because of the way that reality is
or there is no distinction because these terms kind of mean the same thing and so it's it's totally
inapplicable um to our description of reality what is coin going to do with the analytic
synthetic distinction well he is going to end up doing something that's a little bit like saying that
it's useless or that we can't apply it and a little bit like saying that it it doesn't apply
that there are no such things and I think he sort of wavers between those options a little bit
right so at some points coin seems to be saying that he doesn't really know how to apply it that
for instance he doesn't know whether um all green things are extended whether that is a
synthetic synthetic or an analytic statement and so he seems to suggest that we don't don't really
know how to apply it that maybe there's something useless about it um because of our our skill
may be in applying it at other points though uh coin seems to suggest that
it actually like there's nothing in reality like when we look at statements there's nothing about
statements that cuts them up into analytic and synthetic and I think maybe that more radical
reading is the better reading right though what quine wants to end up saying is that
objectively speaking there is no distinction between the statements of a language such that
some of them are the analytic statements and some of them are the synthetic statements right we just
thought there was but there isn't okay so that is what quine in the end wants to say right he
wants to say something like that distinction that you thought there was between the analytic and
the synthetic statement statements if you think about it it's not really there right it's not really
there how does quine argue for that and now i'm going coming to the point where i want to talk
about the structure of the article how is quine going to argue for that well maybe somewhat
surprisingly sections one two three and four are quine trying to elucidate the distinction
or between analytic and synthetic statements by tying it to other concepts to other distinctions
maybe or you know tying it to synonymy tying it to definition tying it to interchangeability and
truth so quine is going to try to sort of elucidate the analytic synthetic distinction
well trying to elucidate something and then maybe failing because that is what's going to happen
quine is going to fail um at least he's going to tell us that you know all the terms that he if he
uses them you know all the terms that allow him to make the analytic synthetic distinction
are in just as much need of clarification as the analytic synthetic distinction itself
trying to do that kind of analysis and even failing that kind of analysis is something that is very
familiar to philosophers right in fact it is something that philosophers do all the time right
i try to make the distinction between good and bad actions um that is what ethicists and meta
ethicists i guess try to do all the time right and they tend to fail um trying to make the
distinction between the causal relations and the non-causal relations that's what people
who create theories of causation try to do and they tend to fail right there tend to be these
counter arguments these cases that don't fit the theory or they tend to come up with theories that
use the same kinds of terms that they were starting from so in order to explain the difference between
good and bad actions i'm going to explain good and bad in terms of other ethical vocabulary
that's also kind of common so suppose that that this is what a philosopher does a philosopher
tries to explain a particular concept or pair of concepts and preferably in a sort of reductionist
way right without staying within the same circle of concepts um so i want to try to explain analytic
and synthetic without ending up talking about meanings and synonymy and and necessity and
you know all the kinds of concepts that kind things are in just as much need of clarification
so suppose i try to do that and suppose that i fail what then
well nothing right try again let somebody else try again it is not very common for a
philosopher to end up saying oh well if i fail at clarifying this distinction in a sort of reductive
way in totally different kinds of terms then it doesn't exist right you you never do that um
you would do one of two things normally either you have some reason to believe that a reductive
analysis must be possible and then you keep trying or you have some reason to maybe the
failure itself is the reason to believe that a reductive analysis is not possible and so you
say well you know there's something primitive about the idea of who knows the idea of meaning or
the idea of synonymy or the idea of analyticity itself or the idea of of necessity right i'm going
to take one of these as one of my primitive terms and that seems kind of okay right there's
there's nothing in a failed attempt to give a reductive analysis of a concept that would imply
that the concept has no content or can't be applied or anything like that
so how could anything that coin does in sections one two three and four of this paper
lead up to the conclusion that the analytic synthetic distinction doesn't match a real
distinction among the statements well my answer to that is that it leads up to it only in a sort
of rhetorical way one two three and four do not i would say even conceivably form an argument
for what happens at the end of the article in section six rather one two three and four
sort of create the psychological state in which we are extra you know interested and extra open
towards the new ideas that coin is going to present to us in section six i believe it was
Pascal who said somewhere that if you want to convert a man to christianity you first have
to make him unhappy because if you're happy you have no interest in being saved and so you have no
interest in listening to this person who is telling you about christianity um something like that is
happening in two dogmas of empiricism right one two three and four and maybe five um our coin trying
to make us unhappy and then six is quines own original vision which wow we are you know much
more interested in and much more likely to embrace if we are unhappy so how does making us unhappy work
well making us unhappy works in such a way that coin is going to point out to us that although we
might have thought that it's not so hard to give an analysis of the analytic and synthetic of the
analytic synthetic distinction um actually it is hard to do this in a non-circular way right maybe
we can only do this in a non-circular way again that's not not not terrible but suppose that you
are already a little bit worried about all of these terms you are already a little bit worried
about meanings and you are already a little bit worried about intentional languages and i'm going
to say a bit more about what that is later on a little bit worried about terms like necessarily
and you are going to be a bit worried about all of those things if you are a contemporary empiricist
well then seeing that all these terms sort of hang together in such a way that you can't really get
out of get out of the circle makes you feel a little bit worried about it all and then when
quine in section six comes with his own vision like this web of belief and this is pragmatism you
might think oh that is actually maybe a better way of thinking about this and you've been convinced
not so much by an argument that shows that the analytic synthetic distinction is is wrong and
therefore we have to think about it in this way but sort of you know you've you've been reading
several pages of of the kind of mood music that plays on your pre-existing anxieties
and puts you in the mood for a radical new vision which quine then supplies at the end
so i would say that that is roughly the structure of the argument and there's something kind of funny
or ironic about that because usually people working in analytic philosophy would say that
analytic philosophy works by argumentation right you have the premises and you get to the conclusion
and it's it's the rational argumentation that that does all the work into dogmas of empiricism
you know it doesn't seem to be the rational argumentation that does the work it seems to be
the mood music and then the metaphors and the vision at the end when quine has his web of belief
that is what does the work that would be actually pretty germane to a philosopher like like Richard
roti who says that you know all the great philosophers introduce new metaphors
but their roti is precisely kind of
not conforming to the self-image of analytic philosophy so i think there's something
deliciously ironic about the fact that two dogmas of empiricism has this
very non-argumentative structure like fundamentally it has a very non-argumentative
structure and that is ironic because it is seen as the greatest example maybe even of a
form of philosophy that claims to be based on argumentation okay so having said all of that
let us look a little bit more at what quine is doing in these first sections
um and i'll get back by the way to the question of why all of this is important
right it's not just a new vision but it's also supposed to be important i'll get back to that
a little bit later on okay so what is happening in these first sections well um basically quine
is going to say okay i don't really understand analyticity what is it let's try to define it in
other terms let's try to understand it in terms of synonymy there's actually something interesting
going on there right quine has this distinction between sentence one and two no unmarried man is
married and no bachelor is married and both of those are supposed to be analytic um and quine
actually accepts that number one is true by virtue of the meaning of the terms right so he actually
accepts here he seems to accept at least that sort of this logical vocabulary is pretty unproblematic
so at least some analytic statements are unproblematic um and then he's going to focus on on the
problematic ones the number two i mean that's not bad right i mean if if the idea of analyticity
has any use then it should be a different idea from the idea of being a logical tautology
so we get through synonymy we get through definition and basically again and again quine
is going to say that um either you have to presuppose analyticity in the definition or you
and end up with a term that is just as obscure as analyticity is
the one that maybe maybe requires some explanation on my part um is what happens in section three
when quine talks about interchangeability salva veritate so the idea would be that you could
maybe define analyticity in terms of truth right you could make the distinction between
analytic and synthetic statements once you have in place the distinction between true and false
statements and surely quine doesn't want to be skeptical about true and false statements right
he doesn't want to get rid of that distinction no he doesn't want to get rid of that distinction
so how can you base analyticity on um truth and falsehood well quine says maybe maybe it's like
this if i have a phrase a and a phrase b and i can always put phrase a in place of phrase b
and whatever sentence i do that in will remain true if it was true or it will remain false if it
was false then these two phrases mean the same thing right and that's what i need to explain
our analyticity sameness of meaning so here's an example um take quine and take the author of two
dogmas of empiricism those are the same person right so we might expect that we can always put
quine and the author of two dogmas of empiricism in the same sentences right we can always replace
one with the other i am talking about quine that's true i am talking about the author of two dogmas
of empiricism well that's also true right sure um and so the idea is if you can always do this for
every sentence and the truth or falsity of the sentence will always remain the same then those
two phrases mean the same thing and now quine is going to ask us whether this is good enough right
if we can always interchange two terms salva viritate right saving truth without making a
difference in truth does that mean that they have the same meaning does that mean that you know
they can ground analytic sentences and quine says yes and this is where we finally sent us
three four and five in the text quine says well yes i mean take a sentence like necessarily
all and only bachelors are bachelors if i can without check that's true right if without
a change in truth value i can put unmarried man in place of bachelors so i get necessarily all
and only bachelors are unmarried men um if we can exchange these two terms without changing
truth value then this is true too and if this is true if it's true that necessarily all and only
bachelors are unmarried men then all and only bachelors are unmarried men is a necessary statement
and therefore again quine thinks that necessity analyticity and a priority are the same thing
and therefore all and only bachelors are unmarried men is analytic so we can actually get to analytic
truths if we have interchangeability solver viri tate and then quine says that this is hocuspocus
why is it hocuspocus well in order to understand why quine thinks this is hocuspocus we have to
make the distinction that he makes between an extensional language and an intentional language
so an extensional language is a language that does not have any phrases or terms or concepts
that allow us to make a difference between two concepts that apply to the same actual things
so take quine and take the author of two dogmas of empiricism those apply to the same thing
in a purely extensional language there would be no sentence in which you exchange one of them
for the other and you know get from a truth through a falsehood or from a falsehood to a truth
two terms with the same extension can always be replaced with one another in an extensional
language without changing truth value in an intentional language that's not true in an
intentional language in a language that for instance can talk about necessities that would
make it intentional in an intent or meanings that would also make it intentional or analyticity
that would always also make it intentional and in a a language that can speak about any of those
things the fact that two terms have the same extension that they apply to the same thing
the same objects doesn't necessarily mean that you can always interchange them
so here's an example barack obama and the first black president of the united states
in fact apply to the same person and so in an extensional language i could always
change one for the other but in an intentional language that's not true
if i were to say barack obama means the first black president of the united states
that's a very strange statement even though the first black president of the united states
means the first black president of the united states seems you know pretty okay or what about this
barack obama could also not have become the first black president of the united states
could right we're talking about possibilities and necessities barack obama could not have
become the first black president of the united states maybe he you know thought about running
for president and then he thought ah i know never mind um okay in that sentence you can't
really change barack obama with the first black president of the united states because the first
black president of the united states could also not have become the first black president of the
united states sounds a bit dubious that sounds a bit dubious now and in fact this this example
i mean there are different ways of thinking about such instances but this example becomes much
much clearer when we think not about like singular terms but when we think about general terms
so an example that quine uses i can't remember whether he uses it here or someone somewhere
else oh yeah he uses it here um is creature with a heart and creature with kidneys right suppose
that it's true that all the animals in the world that have a heart also have kidneys and the animals
that have kidneys also have a heart right suppose that that's true and those two concepts have the
same extension but of course it's not true that we can change them in an intentional language in
every sentence and have the truth value remain the same because it's true that it's possible
that a creature with a heart is not a creature with kidneys that's true it's possible that a
creature with a heart is not a creature with kidneys that's true what about it's possible
that a creature with a heart is not a creature with a heart that's not true so in an intentional
language we cannot change terms that have the same extension but a different intention okay what do we
learn from this what we learn from this is that basing analyticity on truth is only possible
if we have an intentional language because we need
sameness of meaning and we only get sameness of meaning in this intentional language so
basing analyticity on truth only works in an intentional language but to talk about true and
false statements in an intentional language to believe that there is a distinction between true
and false statements in an intentional language is to believe that there is a distinction between
analytic and synthetic statements because for something like necessarily a to be true a has
to be analytic so truth in an intentional language already presupposes that the analytic
synthetic distinction can be applied and so it can't be used to sort of grounded or reductively
analyze it all right so that is what i wanted to say about section three and roughly that is all i
want to say about the first four sections of the paper section five introduces a new idea
it introduces the verification theory and reductionism so quine basically says that the
analytic synthetic distinction seems to make a lot of sense if you hold the idea that there are
that any sentence really can be for any sentence you can say which observations are the ones that
would make it true and which are the ones that will make it false right if you can do that for any
sentence well any sentence where you have something to say is a synthetic sentence
and any sentence where you end up saying well actually it doesn't matter what the observations
are it's true anyway or it doesn't matter what the observations are it's false anyway any sentence
like that is going to be an analytic sentence so the kind of reductionism that quine talks about
implies the analytic synthetic distinction and quine thinks that it is equally hopeless
and for more or less the same reasons the dogma of reductionism survives in the supposition that
each statement taken in isolation from its fellows can admit of confirmation or information at all
my counter suggestion is that our statements about the external world face the tribunal sense
experience not individually but only as a corporate body what quine is going to do here is he's going
to make a counter suggestion the counter suggestion is that statements do not face the tribunal sense
experience individually but only as a corporate body and this is then going to be sort of worked
out in the metaphor of section six what is quine doing and what is he reacting against
well really this is the crux right this is where we find out why two dogmas of empiricism could be
seen as such an important paper analytic philosophy at the time of quine comes from people like Russell
Wittgenstein but especially the the vienna circle the logical positivists people like karnab
who who start out by making this distinction between statements that are you know based in
sense experience and therefore statements of the sciences and statements that are not based on sense
experience statements that are true or false independently of sense experience and those
are supposed to be the analytic statements and since philosophy is not you know in the business
of science philosophy is supposedly at least this is what some of these people some of the people
working in this tradition think our philosophy is supposedly in the business of analyzing sentences
right of taking the analytic sentences analyzing you know them um well really analyzing concepts
and thereby arriving at analytic truths about those concepts and thereby clarifying the structure
of our language right that is what philosophy is supposed to be doing we take concepts we analyze
them that is we we set out analytic truths involving those concepts their analytic truths
that's why we don't need a laboratory and then once we have done that you know we show it to people
and we have clarified our language that's nice that kind of vision of philosophy obviously requires
a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic so what quine is doing here is he's
going to give us a counter vision that immediately impacts the self-description of philosophy it
immediately impacts how we can think about philosophy about what philosophy is about
what the domain of philosophy is if there is no analytic synthetic distinction then there is no
special domain for philosophy there are lots of complications here and one complication that I
want to briefly mention is that at least many of the early adherents of of the analytic or I should
maybe say the positivist tradition many of the early adherents would actually say that philosophy
doesn't make any statements at all that it's a kind of activity um but I'm I'm going to leave
that aside I hope that it's clear why the analytic synthetic distinction the idea that some truths
can be found from the armchair and other truths can only be found by doing science
is going to be absolutely crucial to the self-image of a philosophy that is supposedly an armchair
discipline if the analytic synthetic distinction doesn't exist then we have to rethink what
philosophy is and rethink what its relation to natural science is and that's what quine is going
to do and that's what quine is setting into motion here and that is why two dogmas of empiricism
could become such a famous and influential article because it cuts at the heart of a self-image of
philosophy and to briefly return to Kant um I mean Kant of course thought that philosophy was in
the business of finding not analytic statements but synthetic a priori statements and so I mean part of
part of the part of the dichotomy like like the way that quine sets this up right either you are
finding either you're doing analysis or you are doing something empirical is something that requires
um requires us to see the analytic synthetic distinction and the a priori a posteriori distinction
as the same thing right so that's always in the background here but again that is something that
all these early analytic philosophers agree about so uh what do we end up what is the counter
suggestion well the counter suggestion is that statements face the tribunal sense experience
as a corporate body um this is sort of the duham quine thesis it has become known here is the beginning
of section six the totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs from the most casual matters
of great geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics and even of pure mathematics
and logic is a man-made fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges or to change the
figure total science is like a field of force whose boundary conditions are experienced so the basic
idea is that if I find something in reality uh in observation that doesn't fit my beliefs
which of my beliefs is false that is a wrong question according to quine right that is the
question that can only be asked if you embrace reductionism what we should ask is what changes
plural could I make in order to make my beliefs consistent with the observations again
well there's always multiple options here's a very trivial example suppose that I believe
that there is an elephant behind me I now had a recalcitrant experience I didn't see an elephant
what can I do well of course I can give up the belief that there's an elephant behind me
but I could also give up the belief that my eyes are working correctly or I could adopt the belief
that this elephant behind me has cunningly disguised himself as a bunch of bookshelves
containing philosophy books you know that's possible um now that's kind of a toy example but
in real life situations you very often have very real choices right what's going on
I you know one person said to me that he I don't know uh let's say uh cleaned my house I come into
the house and it's completely dirty what what went on right maybe this person lied or somebody came
into my house and dirty did after he cleaned it up right one of those two things maybe even more
possibilities um those are very real choices very real things that we uh we have to deal with
and so according to quine and this of course goes a step further than anything we've just said
um any statement can be held true come with me if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere
in the system but if I'm willing if I really want to believe some truth I can do it by making
wild adjustments elsewhere I think maybe the best example of that would be conspiracy theorists
right a conspiracy theorist really wants to believe some really wants to believe that the
earth is flat let's say that a flat earth theory really wants to believe that the earth is flat
uh now you find all kinds of evidence that don't fit this idea and so you change your beliefs
right okay although scientists say that the earth is round well they're being paid off by
large corporations um the shadow of the earth on the moon is always circular well that's because I
mean you know you can you can think of some wild theory to adopt that is going to allow you to keep
your idea that the earth is flat doesn't sound very rational um how could any of those choices
be rational well says quine um basically it is you don't want to change too much about your beliefs
right you don't want to change too much about your beliefs and you want to keep sort of your
core beliefs intact um it's a pragmatic choice it's a choice about you know finding the theories
that make the easiest sense with the least changes uh and so on and so forth I don't know I mean I
don't know whether that's really an intelligible criterion but okay that's the criterion that uh
that quine gives us each man is given a scientific heritage plus a continuing barrage of sensory
stimulation and the considerations which guide him in warping a scientific heritage to fit his
continuing sensory promptings are where rational pragmatic so this is a completely new way of
thinking and it's a way of thinking that that seems to obliterate the distinction between science
and philosophy right you can't say science is empirical philosophy is not empirical because
there is no distinction between the empirical and the non empirical that's always a pragmatic choice
and so whatever i'm going to do as a philosopher it's going to be the same kind of thing maybe in a
slightly different way um as what the uh as what the natural scientist is engaged in so ontological
questions are on a par with questions of natural science and we're already well on the way towards
quines naturalized philosophy final thing i want to say about this is that um quines metaphor of the
web of belief is not too precise right if you really start thinking about that it it doesn't
even make much sense what why are some statements more on the edge and others more at the core
well they're supposed to have something to do with whether they could be shown false by experience
but how does experience even get into it right is experience sentence shaped probably not so
how don't we need some sentences that tie immediately to experience quine doesn't say
anything about that here's maybe a more a more a more fundamental worry and quine tells us that
even the laws of logic are just elements of this web of belief which can be changed if that's if
that's useful but then what are the strands between the elements of the web right what
makes it the case that the web is coherent or incoherent right what makes it the case that if
i believe a and i believe not a that then there is a tension a problem in my web of belief well
that's surely the laws of logic but if they themselves are merely further elements in the
web then they seem to play a sort of impossible dual role in the metaphor being elements that
can be changed and being the standards that we use to judge whether the web is coherent or not
so that i don't know i mean again quite doesn't say much about that now i don't think that we
need to criticize quine for that too harshly here because he's merely offering us a metaphor
and it's sort of a a promise that maybe in his later philosophy is going to do more he's going
to tell us more he's going to work this out and he is going to work this out okay but it's good to
be aware of that you know this web metaphor by itself maybe generates a lot more questions than
it answers all right um so i've tried to tell you why people think that this is such an important
paper how it could have a big impact on the history of 20th century philosophy it's strange
non-argumentative nature the historical background against which it makes sense
and some of these sort of promissory notes that quine is singing at the end of this of this paper
does quine defeat the analytic synthetic distinction well i would say in no way right you
already need to have quines empiricists anxieties in order to be very impressed with anything that
goes on in sections one two three and four and if you think they're talking about meanings and
necessity and so on it's perfectly alright and perfectly intelligible there's nothing in this
paper that is going to suggest you that you're wrong right there's nothing in this paper that's
going to suggest you that there's anything problematic about analytic and synthetic statements
so i think that is also good to keep in mind so it's important um certainly from from the
point of view of the self-image of philosophy this is an important paper had a lot of influence
i wouldn't say that it's a paper that shows us that the analytic synthetic distinction doesn't
exist because it only shows that to people in a very very specific uh philosophical state of mind
thank you
