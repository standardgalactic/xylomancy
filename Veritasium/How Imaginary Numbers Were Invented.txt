Mathematics began as a way to quantify our world, to measure land, predict the motions
of planets, and keep track of commerce. Then came a problem considered impossible.
The secret to solving it was to separate math from the real world, to split algebra from geometry,
and to invent new numbers so fanciful they are called imaginary. Ironically, 400 years later,
these very numbers turn up in the heart of our best physical theory of the universe.
Only by abandoning math's connection to reality, could we discover reality's true nature.
In 1494, Luca Paccioli, who is Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, publishes Suma
di Erathmetica, a comprehensive summary of all mathematics known in Renaissance Italy at the
time. In it, there is a section on the cubic, any equation which today we would write as
ax cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d equals zero. People have been trying to find a general
solution to the cubic for at least 4,000 years. But each ancient civilization that encountered
it, the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians, they all came up empty-handed.
Paccioli's conclusion is that a solution to the cubic equation is impossible.
Now this should be at least a little surprising, since without the x-cube term,
the equation is simply a quadratic. And many ancient civilizations had solved quadratics
thousands of years earlier. Today, anyone who's passed eighth grade knows the general solution.
It's minus b plus minus root b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But most people just plug and chug
into this formula, completely oblivious to the geometry that ancient mathematicians used
to derive it. You know, back in those days, mathematics wasn't written down in equations,
it was written with words and pictures. Take for example the equation x squared plus 26x
equals 27. Ancient mathematicians would think of the x squared term like a literal square
with sides of length x. And then 26x, well that would be a rectangle with one side length 26
and the other side of length x. And these two areas together add to 27. So how do we figure
out what x is? Well, we can take this 26x rectangle and cut it in half. So now I have two 13x
rectangles and I can position them so the new shape I create is almost a square. It's just missing
this section down here. But I know the dimensions of this section, it's just 13 by 13. So I can
complete the square by adding in a 13 by 13 square. Now since I've added 13 squared or 169 to the
left-hand side of the equation, I also have to add 169 to the right-hand side of the equation
to maintain the equality. So now I have this larger square with sides of length x plus 13
and it is equal to 196. Now the square root of 196 is 14. So I know that the sides of this square
have length 14, which means x is equal to 1. Now this is a great visual way to solve a quadratic
equation, but it isn't complete. I mean if you look at our original equation, x equals 1 is a
solution, but so is negative 27. For thousands of years, mathematicians were oblivious to the
negative solutions to their equations because they were dealing with things in the real world,
lengths and areas and volumes. I mean what would it mean to have a square with sides of length
negative 27? That just doesn't make any sense. So for those mathematicians, negative numbers
didn't exist. You could subtract, that is find the difference between two positive quantities,
but you couldn't have a negative answer or negative coefficients. Mathematicians were so
averse to negative numbers that there was no single quadratic equation. Instead, there were six
different versions arranged so that the coefficients were always positive. The same approach was taken
with the cubic. In the 11th century, Persian mathematician Omar Qayam identified 19 different
cubic equations, again keeping all coefficients positive. He found numerical solutions to some
of them by considering the intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles,
but he fell short of his ultimate goal, a general solution to the cubic. He wrote,
maybe one of those who will come after us will succeed in finding it.
400 years later and 4,000 kilometers away, the solution begins to take shape.
Scipione del Ferro is a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna.
Sometime around 1510, he finds a method to reliably solve depressed cubics. These are a subset of
cubic equations with no x squared term. So what does he do after solving a problem that has stumped
mathematicians for millennia, when considered impossible by Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher?
He tells no one. See, being a mathematician in the 1500s is hard. Your job is constantly
under threat from other mathematicians who can show up at any time and challenge you for your
position. You can think of it like a math duel. Each participant submits a set of questions to the
other, and the person who solves the most questions correctly gets the job, while the loser suffers
public humiliation. As far as del ferro knows, no one else in the world can solve the depressed
cubic, so by keeping his solution secret, he guarantees his own job security. For nearly
two decades, del ferro keeps his secret. Only on his deathbed in 1526 does he let it slip to his
student Antonio Fior. Fior is not as talented a mathematician as his mentor, but he is young
and ambitious. And after del ferro's death, he boasts about his own mathematical prowess,
and specifically his ability to solve the depressed cubic. On February 12, 1535, Fior challenges
mathematician Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, who has recently moved to Fior's hometown of Venice.
Niccolò Fontana is no stranger to adversity. As a kid, his face was cut open by a French soldier,
leaving him with a stutter. That's why he's known as Tartaglia, which means stutterer in Italian.
Growing up in poverty, Tartaglia is largely self-taught. He claws his way up through Italian
society to become a respected mathematician. Now, all of that is at stake. As is the custom in the
challenge, Tartaglia gives a very disortment of 30 problems to Fior. Fior gives 30 problems to
Tartaglia, all of which are depressed cubics. Each mathematician has 40 days to solve the
30 problems they've been given. Fior can't solve a single problem. Tartaglia solves all 30 of Fior's
depressed cubics in just two hours. It seems Fior's boastfulness was his undoing. Before the
challenge came, Tartaglia learns of Fior's claim to have solved the depressed cubic, but he's
skeptical. I did not deem him capable of finding such a rule on his own, Tartaglia writes. But
word was that a great mathematician had revealed the secret to Fior, which seems more plausible.
So with the knowledge that a solution to the cubic is possible, and with his livelihood on the line,
Tartaglia sets about solving the depressed cubic himself. To do it, he extends the idea of completing
the square into three dimensions. Take the equation x cubed plus 9x equals 26. You can think of
x cubed as the volume of a cube with sides of length x. And if you add a volume of 9x, you get
26. So just like with completing the square, we need to add onto the cube to increase its volume
by 9x. Imagine extending three sides of this cube out a distance y, creating a new larger cube
with sides of length, call it z. z is just x plus y. The original cube has been padded out,
and we can break up the additional volume into seven shapes. There are three rectangular prisms
with dimensions of x by x by y, and another three narrower prisms with dimensions of x by y by y.
Plus there's a cube with a volume y cubed. Tartaglia rearranges the six rectangular prisms
into one block. One side has length 3y, the other has a length x plus y, which is z, and the height
is x. So the volume of this shape is its base 3yz times its height x. And Tartaglia realizes
this volume can perfectly represent the 9x term in the equation if its base is equal to nine.
So he sets 3yz equals nine. Putting the cube back together, you find we're missing the one small
y cubed block. So we can complete the cube by adding y cubed to both sides of the equation.
Now we have z cubed, the complete larger cube, equals 26 plus y cubed. We have two equations
and two unknowns. Solving the first equation for z and substituting into the second,
we get y to the sixth plus 26 y cubed equals 27. At first glance, it seems like we're now worse
off than when we started. The variable is now raised to the power of six instead of just three.
However, if you think of y cubed as a new variable, the equation is actually a quadratic,
the same quadratic that we solved by completing the square. So we know y cubed equals one,
which means y equals one. And z equals three over y, so z is three. And since x plus y equals z,
x must be equal to two. Which is indeed a solution to the original equation. And with that,
Tartaglia becomes the second human on the planet to solve the depressed cubic.
To save himself the work of going through the geometry for each new cubic he encounters,
Tartaglia summarizes his method in an algorithm, a set of instructions. He writes this down not
as a set of equations like we would today, modern algebraic notation wouldn't exist for another
hundred years, but instead as a poem. Tartaglia's victory makes him something of a celebrity.
Mathematicians are desperate to learn how he solved the cubic, especially Gerolamo Cardano,
a polymath based in Milan. As you can guess, Tartaglia will have none of it. He refuses to
reveal even a single question from the competition. But Cardano is persistent. He writes a series of
letters that alternate between flattery and aggressive attacks. Eventually, with the promise
of an introduction to his wealthy benefactor, Cardano manages to lure Tartaglia to Milan.
And there, on March 25, 1539, Tartaglia reveals his method, but only after forcing Cardano to swear
a solemn oath not to tell anyone the method, not to publish it, and to write it only in cipher,
quote, so that after my death no one shall be able to understand it.
Cardano is delighted and immediately starts playing around with Tartaglia's algorithm,
but he has a loftier goal in mind, a solution to the full cubic equation including the x-squared
term. And amazingly, he discovers it. If you substitute for x, x minus b over 3a, then all
the x-squared terms cancel out. This is the way to turn any general cubic equation into a depressed
cubic, which can then be solved by Tartaglia's formula. Cardano is so excited to have solved
the problem that stumped the best mathematicians for thousands of years, he wants to publish it.
Unlike his peers, Cardano has no need to keep the solution a secret. He makes his living
not as a mathematician, but as a physician and famous intellectual. For him,
the credit is more valuable than the secret. The only problem is the oath he swore to Tartaglia,
who won't let him break it. And you might think this would be the end of it, but in 1542,
Cardano travels to Bologna, and there he visits a mathematician who just happens to be the son-in-law
of one Scipione Delfero, the man who, on his deathbed, gave the solution to the depressed
cubic to Antonio Fior. Cardano finds this solution in Delfero's old notebook, which is shared with
him during the visit. This solution predates Tartaglia's by decades. So now, as Cardano sees it,
he can publish the full solution to the cubic without violating his oath to Tartaglia.
Three years later, Cardano publishes Ars Magna, The Great Art, an updated compendium of mathematics,
written in five years, may it last for 500. Cardano writes a chapter with a unique geometric
proof for each of the 13 arrangements of the cubic equation. Although he acknowledges the
contributions of Tartaglia, Delfero, and Fior, Tartaglia is displeased, to say the least. He
writes insulting letters to Cardano and sees a good fraction of the mathematics community.
And he has a point. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano's
method. But Ars Magna is a phenomenal achievement. It pushes geometrical reasoning to its very
breaking point, literally. While Cardano is writing Ars Magna, he comes across some cubic
equations that can't easily be solved in the usual way, like x cubed equals 15x plus four.
Plugging this into the algorithm yields a solution that contains the square roots of negative numbers.
Cardano asks Tartaglia about the case, but he evades and implies Cardano is just not clever
enough to use his formula properly. The reality is, Tartaglia has no idea what to do either.
Cardano walks back through the geometric derivation of a similar problem to see exactly what goes
wrong. While the 3D cube slicing and rearrangement works just fine, the final quadratic completing
the square step leads to a geometric paradox. Cardano finds part of a square that must have
an area of 30, but also sides of length 5. Since the full square has an area of 25,
to complete the square, Cardano has to somehow add negative area. That is where the square roots of
negatives come from, the idea of negative area. Now this isn't the first time square
roots of negatives show up in mathematics. In fact, earlier in Ars Magna is this problem.
Find two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40. You can combine these equations into the
quadratic x squared plus 40 equals 10x. But if you plug this into the quadratic formula,
the solutions contain the square roots of negatives. The obvious conclusion is that a solution doesn't
exist, which you can verify by looking at the original problem. There are no two real numbers
which add to 10 and multiply to 40. So mathematicians understood square roots of
negative numbers were math's way of telling you there is no solution. But this cubic equation is
different. With a little guessing and checking, you can find that x equals 4 is a solution.
So why doesn't the approach that works for all other cubics find the perfectly reasonable solution
to this one? Unable to see a way forward, Cardano avoids this case in Ars Magna,
saying the idea of the square root of negatives is as subtle as it is useless.
But around 10 years later, the Italian engineer Raphael Bombele picks up where Cardano left off.
Undeterred by the square roots of negatives and the impossible geometry they imply,
he wants to find a way through the mess to the solution. Observing that the square root of a
negative cannot be called either positive or negative, he lets it be its own new type of number.
Bombele assumes the two terms in Cardano's solution can be represented as some combination
of an ordinary number and this new type of number which involves the square root of negative one.
And this way, Bombele figures out that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation are equivalent to
two plus or minus the square root of negative one. So when he takes the final step and adds them
together, the square roots cancel out, leaving the correct answer four. This feels nothing short
of miraculous. Cardano's method does work, but you have to abandon the geometric proof that
generated it in the first place. Negative areas, which make no sense in reality, must exist as
an intermediate step on the way to the solution. Over the next hundred years, modern mathematics
takes shape. In the 1600s, Francois Viet introduces the modern symbolic notation for algebra,
ending the millennia-long tradition of math problems as drawings and wordy descriptions.
Geometry is no longer the source of truth. René Descartes makes heavy use of the square
roots of negatives, popularizing them as a result. And while he recognizes their utility,
he calls them imaginary numbers, a name that sticks, which is why Euler later introduces
the letter I to represent the square root of negative one. When combined with regular numbers,
they form complex numbers. The cubic led to the invention of these new numbers and liberated
algebra from geometry. By letting go of what seems like the best description of reality, the
geometry you can see and touch, you get a much more powerful and complete mathematics that can solve
real problems. And it turns out, the cubic is just the beginning.
In 1925, Erwin Schrodinger is searching for a wave equation that governs the behavior of quantum
particles building on de Broglie's insight that matter consists of waves. He comes up with one
of the most important and famous equations in all of physics, the Schrodinger equation,
and featured prominently within it is I, the square root of negative one. While mathematicians
have grown accustomed to imaginary numbers, physicists have not and are uncomfortable seeing
it show up in such a fundamental theory. Schrodinger himself writes, what is unpleasant here and
indeed directly to be objected to is the use of complex numbers. The wave function psi is
surely fundamentally a real function. This seems like a fair objection, so why does an
imaginary number that first appeared in the solution to the cubic turn up in fundamental physics?
Well, it's because of some unique properties of imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers exist
on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line. Together, they form the complex plane.
Watch what happens when we repeatedly multiply by I. Starting with one, one times I is I.
I times I is negative one, by definition. Negative one times I is negative I. And negative I times
I is one. We've come back to where we started, and if we keep multiplying by I, the point will
keep rotating around. So when you're multiplying by I, what you're really doing is rotating by 90
degrees in the complex plane. Now, there is a function that repeatedly multiplies by I as you
go down the x-axis, and that is e to the Ix. It creates a spiral by essentially spreading out
these rotations all along the x-axis. If you look at the real part of this spiral, it's a cosine
wave. And if you look at the imaginary part, it's a sine wave. The two quintessential functions that
describe waves are both contained in e to the Ix. So when Schrodinger goes to write down a wave
equation, he naturally assumes that the solutions to his equation will look something like e to the
Ix, specifically e to the I kx minus omega t. You might wonder why he would use that formulation
and not just a simple sine wave, but the exponential has some useful properties. If you take the
derivative with respect to position or time, that derivative is proportional to the original
function itself. And that's not true if you use the sine function, whose derivative is cosine.
Plus, since the Schrodinger equation is linear, you can add together an arbitrary number of
solutions of this form, creating any sort of wave shape you like, and it too will be a solution
to Schrodinger's equation. The physicist Freeman Dyson later writes, Schrodinger put the square root
of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a wave equation
instead of a heat conduction equation. And Schrodinger found to his delight that the equation has
solutions corresponding to the quantized orbits in the Bohr model of the atom. It turns out that
the Schrodinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the behavior of atoms.
It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics. And that square root of minus one means
that nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers. This discovery came as a
complete surprise to Schrodinger as well as to everybody else. So imaginary numbers discovered
as a quirky intermediate step on the way to solving the cubic turn out to be fundamental to
our description of reality. Only by giving up math's connection to reality could it guide us to a
deeper truth about the way the universe works.
