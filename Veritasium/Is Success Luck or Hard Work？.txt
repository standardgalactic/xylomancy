During the COVID lockdown, this headline went viral.
Nearly half of men say they do most of the homeschooling.
3% of women agree.
I bring this up not to debate who's right,
but because it's a great example
of something called egocentric bias.
Most people think they do most of the work.
For example, researchers have asked authors
of multi-author papers,
what percentage of the work they personally did.
And when they add up those percentages,
the sum is on average 140%.
When couples are asked to estimate
how much of the housework they do,
the combined total is almost always over 100%.
Now you might think this is because people want to appear
more helpful than they actually are,
but that's not it.
When couples are asked what fraction of the fights they start
or how much of the mess is theirs,
the total is again over 100.
People think they do more of the work,
but they also think they cause more of the problems.
So why is this?
I think it's simply because you experience
and remember vividly all of what you do,
but not all of what everyone else does.
So naturally you overestimate your own contributions
and underestimate others.
And I think this bias leads us to underestimate
the influence of other things on our lives,
like the role luck plays in our success.
Take hockey players, for example.
If you ask a professional hockey player
how they managed to reach the NHL,
they might mention their hard work, determination,
great coaches, their parents' willingness
to get up at 5 a.m. and so on,
but they probably won't acknowledge
how lucky they were to be born in January.
And yet in many years, 40% of hockey players
selected into top tier leagues
are born in the first quarter of the year,
compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter.
An early birthday can make you up to four times as likely
to be a pro hockey player.
And the reason for this disparity is presumably
because the cutoff date for kids hockey leagues
is January 1st.
Those born in the first part of the year
are a little older and so on average bigger and faster
than kids in their league born late in the year.
Now as they grow up,
this difference should eventually shrink to nothing,
but it doesn't.
Because the young kids who share the most promise
are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments
where they receive better coaching and improve their skills.
And these advantages compound year after year,
so by the time you get to the pros,
birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year.
But does any professional hockey player
feel thankful for their birthday?
Probably not.
And we are all like that,
largely oblivious to the fortunate events
that support our success.
Probably the most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy
is being born into a prosperous country.
Around half the variance in income received
by people around the world is explained
by their country of residence
and that country's income distribution.
If you were born in Burundi, for example,
which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita
of just $730 a year,
it doesn't matter how smart or hardworking you are,
you're unlikely to earn much as an adult.
Now, many people get offended
if you point out how big a role chance plays in their success.
And I get it, if we are just a product of our circumstances,
then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing.
People think it has to be either skill or luck
that explains success, but the truth is you need both.
Take these eight track and field world records.
All the athletes who achieve these records
are obviously world-class,
extremely dedicated and talented,
and yet when they achieved their world records,
seven out of eight had a tailwind.
Now, these athletes all had the ability to win a gold medal,
but to set the world record required a bit of luck as well.
The importance of luck increases the greater
the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces.
Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts.
From over 18,300 applicants in 2017,
only 11 were selected and went on to graduate
from the astronaut training program.
And we can make a toy model of the selection process.
Let's assume that astronauts are selected
mostly based on skill, experience and hard work,
but also say 5% as a result of luck, fortunate circumstances.
For each applicant, I randomly generated
a skill score out of 100,
and I also randomly generated a luck score out of 100.
Then I added those numbers together,
weighted in the 95 to five ratio to get an overall score.
This score represents the selector's judgments,
meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts.
And I repeated this simulation a thousand times,
representing a thousand different astronaut selections.
And what I found was the astronauts who were picked
were very lucky.
They had an average luck score of 94.7.
So how many of the selected astronauts
would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone?
The answer was on average only 1.6.
That means even with luck accounting
for just 5% of the outcome,
nine or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected
would have been different if luck played no role at all.
When competition is fierce,
being talented and hardworking is important,
but it's not enough to guarantee success.
You also need to catch a break.
Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck
because by definition, it's not something we did.
Like the housework done by your significant other,
it goes unappreciated.
And here's the crazy thing.
Downplaying the importance of chance events
may actually improve your probability of success.
Because if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain,
you're less likely to invest effort in it,
which further decreases your chances of success.
So it's a useful delusion to believe
you are in full control of your destiny.
I mean, if I had known how bad I was when I started YouTube
or how much work it would take,
I might have given up right then.
Welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.
Now, there may be another benefit
to overlooking your lucky breaks,
which is it makes it easier to justify your place in society.
If you have a lot of wealth or power,
you can just chalk it up to your own
intelligence, effort, and perseverance.
It makes it easier to accept inequality.
In one experiment, participants were put in groups
of three in small rooms to discuss a complex moral problem.
And one person in each group
was randomly designated the team leader.
Half an hour later, the experimenter came by
with four cookies for each team.
So who got the extra cookie?
In each case, it went to the team leader.
Even though they had no special aptitude,
they didn't have extra responsibilities,
and they'd gotten their position through chance alone.
Once you have achieved a certain status,
it seems natural to feel like you deserve it
and all the other good things that come your way.
Now, this is just an anecdote,
but whenever I've been upgraded to fly a business class,
I've always observed the worst behavior
in my fellow privileged passengers.
They just act so entitled and uncourteous.
And research has found evidence for this as well.
In another experiment, participants were asked to think
of a good thing that happened to them recently.
And then one group was asked to list
their own personal qualities or actions
that made that good thing happen.
Another group was asked to list external factors
beyond their control that led to the event.
And a control group was simply asked to list reasons
why the good thing happened.
Now, for completing this task,
participants were told they would be paid a dollar.
But at the end, they were offered the option
to donate some or all of the money to a charity.
Results showed those who listed
their own personal attributes contributed 25% less
than those who listed external factors beyond their control.
Now, think of what all this means for people in our society,
specifically for people in positions of power,
like business leaders and politicians.
Now, undoubtedly, most of them are talented and hardworking,
but they have also been luckier than most.
And like most of us, they don't realize
just how lucky they are.
And this gives them a distorted view of reality.
They're kind of living in a form of survivor bias.
All these leaders have worked hard and ultimately succeeded.
So to them, the world appears fair.
In their experience, it rewards hard work.
But what they don't have is the experience
of all the people who have worked hard and failed.
So what are they to make of people
less successful than themselves?
Well, the natural conclusion is that
they must just be less talented or less hardworking.
And this perspective makes them less inclined
to be generous, to give back.
And they are the ones who set the rules
for how society operates.
And this is particularly unfortunate
since one of the main ways many of us are lucky
is in our country of residence.
But what is a country, except for the things put there
by people who came before, the roads and the schools,
public transport, emergency services,
clean air and water, everything like that?
It seems a cruel trick of our psychology
that successful people without any malice
will credit their success largely to their own hard work
and ingenuity, and therefore contribute less
to maintaining the very circumstances
that made that success possible in the first place.
The good news is that acknowledging
our fortunate circumstances
not only brings us more in line with reality,
it also makes us more likable.
In a study where people had to read the transcript
of a fictional 60 minutes interview
with a biotech entrepreneur,
experimenters tried changing just the last paragraph
where the interviewee is talking about the reasons
for their company's success.
In one version, the entrepreneur personally takes credit
for the success they've had.
But in the other, he says luck played a significant role.
Now, people who read the luck version of the transcript
judged the entrepreneur as kinder
and thought they'd be more likely to be close friends
with him than those who read the other version
of the transcript.
And raising our awareness of fortunate events
can also make us happier
because it allows us to feel gratitude.
Personally, I am grateful to Michael Stevens of Vsauce
who on October 7th, 2012, posted the video
how much does a shadow weigh,
which shouts out my slow motion slinky drop video.
And within three days,
my subscribers had increased by a third.
And within a month, they had doubled,
leading me to quit my part-time job
and work exclusively on YouTube videos.
And I'm grateful to the writer of the free newspaper
they give out on the trains in Sydney
who didn't quite understand electricity,
leading me to post this picture of their article
to my Instagram with a caption,
what's wrong with this picture?
And I'm lucky that the first person to answer correctly
was a beautiful woman who became my future wife.
Yep, that is how I met your mother.
Now initially, I wanted to make this video
just to say our circumstances and psychology
conspired to make us oblivious to our own luck.
And this leads successful people to view the world as fair
and those less successful than them
as less talented or less hardworking.
And this is before you factor in
any discrimination or prejudice.
But it also became apparent to me
that I should talk about what to do
if you want to be successful in such a world.
And I think the best advice is paradoxical.
First, you must believe that you are in complete control
of your destiny and that your success comes down
only to your own talent and hard work.
But second, you've got to know that's not true
for you or anyone else.
So you have to remember if you do achieve success
that luck played a significant role
and given your good fortune,
you should do what you can to increase the luck of others.
Hey, so I had an idea for what I could do
to increase the luck of others.
And that is to give away 100 Snadam's kits
to people who couldn't otherwise afford them.
So if you didn't know, Snadam's is a product
that I invented and kick-started five years ago.
It's a molecular modeling kit
where all the atoms snap together magnetically.
Now I made it because I really wanted to tackle
the misconception that bonds store energy.
They don't.
It takes energy to break them.
And you can feel that with Snadam's.
Recently, I completely retooled Snadam's
so there are small holes where the magnets are.
This allows them to touch directly,
increasing the bonding strength
so you can form bigger, more stable molecules.
I call these Snadam's X.
And yes, they are backwards compatible
with original Snadam's.
So here's my idea.
For the next month, you can buy Snadam's
for 10% off using the code give luck.
And for each one sold,
I will give a kit to someone who can't afford one
up to a limit of 100.
So I'll put links and more details in the description.
And I really wanna thank you for watching.
And thank you for all my good luck.
