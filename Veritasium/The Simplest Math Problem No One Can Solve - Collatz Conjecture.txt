This is the most dangerous problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned
not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's best
mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdisch, a famous mathematician, said,
mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions.
Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven. Good choice. Okay, we're going to apply
two rules. If the number is odd, we multiply by three and add one. So three times seven is
twenty-one plus one is twenty-two. If the number is even, we divide by two. So twenty-two divided
by two is eleven. Now we keep applying these two rules. Eleven is odd, so we multiply by three,
thirty-three, and add one, thirty-four. Even divided by two, seventeen. Odd. Multiply by three,
fifty-one, add one, fifty-two. Even. Divide by two, twenty-six. Still even. Divide by two,
thirteen. Odd. So we multiply by three, thirty-nine, add one, and that's forty, which is even. So we
divide by two, twenty. Divide by two, ten. Divide by two, five. Odd. Multiply by three,
fifteen. Add one, sixteen. Divide by two, that's eight. And then four, two, and one. Now one is
odd, so we multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one,
so we're in a loop. And the lowest number is one. Now the conjecture is this. Every positive
integer, if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop. This is commonly
called the Kallatz conjecture after German mathematician Lothar Kallatz, who may have come
up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many origin stories and many names. It's also known as
the Ulam conjecture, Kakotani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Haase's algorithm, the Syracuse
problem, and simply 3n plus one. Why is 3x plus one so famous? Among professional mathematicians,
maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone actually admits in public that
they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. The numbers you get by applying
3x plus one are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thunder
cloud, but eventually they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the
numbers as representing the height above the ground in meters, so a number like 26 would start 26
meters above the ground, and if you apply 3x plus one, it rises up as high as 40 meters,
and in total it takes 10 steps to get to one, so 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the
very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all the way up to
9232. As an altitude, that is higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground.
In total, it takes 111 steps for 27 to get down to one, and end up in the 4 to 1 loop.
The paths that different numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other,
so how do you even start to make progress on this problem? Well honestly, mathematicians struggled.
People just decided that this was something invented by the Soviets to slow down
U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it, because everybody's sitting there
twiddling their thumbs and making no progress on this trivial thing that you can tell school children.
Jeffrey Legerius is the world authority on 3x plus one.
The first time I met him, I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and he said,
don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending time
writing about this, or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while to establish yourself.
But what about the paths they take to get there? The pattern is randomness.
Here is the sequence of a large number chosen at random. The graph peaks, and then drops solo
that you can't really see what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm,
you find this wiggly graph with a downward trend. It looks kind of like the stock market on a bad day.
And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of geometric Brownian motion. That means,
if you take the log and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping
a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x plus one is just
like the random wiggles of the stock market. Over long enough periods, the stock market tends to
trend upwards, while 3x plus one trends down. Another way to analyze 3x plus one is by looking
at the leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone numbers starting with three
as the seed. And we can count up how many numbers start with a one, how many start with a two,
how many start with a three, and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the
sequence that starts with four. That's a short one. And for the sequences that start with five,
six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with
each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this for more
and more numbers, eventually the histogram settles into a stable pattern. For the first
billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers
start with one. Around 17.5% start with two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the numbers start with nine. Now this pattern
is not unique to 3x plus one. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries
to the value of companies, all the physical constants and the Fibonacci numbers just to name
a few. The distribution is known as Benford's law. And it is even used to detect fraud. If all
the numbers on your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then well, you're probably being honest.
If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot
irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best when the
numbers involved span several orders of magnitude, as they do for 3x plus one. But Benford's law can't
tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four to one loop or not. For that, we need a different
sort of analysis. At first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x plus one,
all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that there are the same number of
odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in
half. Therefore, it seems like every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the
catch. Every time you multiply an odd number by three and then add one, it will always become an
even number. And that means the next step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not actually
tripled by 3x plus one, they're increased by a factor of about three over two. I'm neglecting
the plus one because it's insignificant for large numbers. And three halves is actually the most an
odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one odd number in a sequence to the next
odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time
dividing by two brings you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time you can divide by four
before you get to the next odd number. So for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence
will be three fourths of its initial value. An eighth of the time you can divide by eight before
getting to the next odd number. And a sixteenth of the time you can divide by 16 and so on.
If you take the geometric mean you find on average to get from one odd number to the next one,
you multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking,
three x plus one sequences are more likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example,
multiply by three and add one, you get 1024, which you can divide by two, and then divide by two
again and again and again and again 10 times in total until you're down to one. One way to
visualize these paths of numbers in three x plus one is simply to show how each number connects to
the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a series
of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single
number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all the way out to infinity eventually
flows into the massive river of four to one. Some mathematicians have modified this visualization
by rotating the graph at each number, anticlockwise if it's an odd number and clockwise if it's even.
And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the
degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful organic looking shapes.
Now there are two ways the conjecture could be false. There could be a number somewhere,
some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason,
it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility
is there exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would
be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far no loop or sequence that shoots off to infinity
has been found. And not for lack of trying. Mathematicians have tested by brute force every
single number up to 2 to the 68. That's 295 quintillion 147 quadrillion 905 trillion 179
billion 352 million 825 thousand 856 numbers. We know for certain that every single one of those
numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly 300 quintillion numbers and
none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate
that any loop other than 421 must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians have attempted to
prove it is by making a scatter plot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from
each seed's sequence on the y-axis. Now if you can show that in every 3x plus one sequence,
there is a number that is smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven the
collat's conjecture. Because whatever number you pick, you know it will at some point get smaller.
And that smaller number, as a seed, also gets smaller, and so on down to one. Meaning the
only way any sequence can end is in the 421 loop. This has not yet been shown. But in 1976,
Rihoteras was able to show that almost all collat sequences reach a point below their
initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than x to the
power of point eight six nine. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than x to the power
of point seven nine two five. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical
definition. It means that as the numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that
end up under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest living mathematicians,
Terry Tao, was able to show three x plus one obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x. So long as that function goes to
infinity, as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise as slowly as you like. So log x is an
example or log log x works to or log log log log x. What this means is for almost all numbers,
you can guarantee that there is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public
talk he gave in 2020, Terry Tao said this is about as close as one can get to the collats conjecture
without actually solving it. This is an impressive result. But it's still not a proof. So why can't
we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean everyone is trying to prove
it true, which means almost no one is looking for counter examples. It happened to me just two years
ago where there was a there was something I was trying to prove that I was trying for three years
to prove. And I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counter example. And then I realized
what the correct statement should have been. And then a month later I proved the correct statement.
Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counter examples than we're currently spending.
I mean remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed numbers up to
10,000 with the largest number reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at
100,000 but not all numbers can be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663 for example climbs as high
as 27 million. And as yet no one has proven why a number couldn't just shoot off to infinity.
And it would take only one to disprove the conjecture. Or some set of numbers could be part of a loop
not connected to the main graph. As far as we know there is only one loop for 2,1. But something
strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x plus 1 rules as before
there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start
at low values like minus 17 and minus 5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative
side of the number line but not on the positive side? Now one of the most convincing pieces of
evidence supporting the conjecture is Terry Tows proof that almost all numbers have a number in
their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all numbers obey this criteria
isn't the same thing as proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between 1 and 100 are perfect
squares? The answer is 10. So 10% of numbers up to 100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between
1 and 1000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up to 1000 are
perfect squares. And the higher you go the smaller this percentage becomes. Such that in the limit
you could say almost all numbers are not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not
perfect squares goes to 1 as x goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite number of
perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now we've tested by brute force all numbers
up to 2 to the 68 and they all obey the call-outs conjecture. And you might be thinking that well
we should have found a counter example by this point. But on the scale of all numbers 2 to the 68
is nothing. I mean the Polya conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an odd number of prime factors. The conjecture
was eventually proven false by C. Brian Hasselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counter example.
What's remarkable is the value of this counter example was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's
some 10 to the 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x plus 1. One way to think
about 3x plus 1 is as though it's a simple program run on a Turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture 2 to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long.
You can think of them as a string of 1s and 0s or black and white squares. Saying that the machine
has transformed every input up to this 68 square tape down to 1 should not give you a lot of
confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact it's fairly simple to calculate a number
that shows any arbitrary behavior you like so long as it is finite. If you want a number that
increases by 3 over 2 five consecutive times you can calculate that number. If you want a number
that climbs by 3 over 2 ten times in a row or a hundred times or a thousand times you can easily
calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify you have no more control
and every number that has ever been tested always falls to 1. If there is a counter example it's
virtually impossible that someone's going to guess it and the space of all possibilities is too big
to search exhaustively by brute force. 2 to the thousand is not a searchable space so if we're
going to find it we have to find it by some intelligent process and not by guess and check.
I had been on team 3x plus 1 for 20 years and then at this point of view I realized that like
do we really know do we what what it's very hard to prove a theorem that's false
and so could it be that everyone's struggling to prove this thing because it's not actually true
and 2 to the 60 is not a lot of evidence and even the statistical version is maybe true and
not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory somewhere in the 3x plus 1 sequence.
Of course there is another option and that is that we'll never know that the problem is
undecidable. In 1987 John Conway created a generalization of 3x plus 1 it was a mathematical
machine that he called Fractran and he was able to show this machine is touring complete which
means it can do anything a modern computer can do but it also means that it's subject to the halting
problem a chance that the machine never stops running and so doesn't give you an output and
this does not prove that 3x plus 1 is also subject to the halting problem but it is possible that
given what we know we may never prove the call-outs conjecture true or false. You're going to be taught
in school that we know a bunch of stuff and it's a lie they're all lies here's this stupid little
problem come on really we can't solve this really you know it just shows the math is hard
if anything it shows that all the things that we can solve are miracles we have no right to have
solutions to all these other problems. For my whole life I've thought of numbers as these
incredibly regular things full of patterns symmetry and repetition but what I'm realizing
only now is just how peculiar numbers really are you can see this most clearly in the coral
representation from a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate organic looking and
thus far intractable to us do all numbers connect to this structure or is there some
unique filament a spindly little thread that doesn't connect to any of this that runs off to
infinity and why is it so hard to tell I think that's why Paul Erdorsch said mathematics is not
yet ripe enough for such questions. What I love about 3x plus 1 is it's a problem almost anyone
can understand and play around with and actually trying to figure things out for yourself is the
best way to learn which is why I subscribe to Brilliant the sponsor of this video now recently
