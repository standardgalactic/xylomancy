Wittgenstein's Tractatus is one of the most baffling and mysterious and mystical and brilliant
and difficult works of philosophy ever written. It baffles pretty much everyone who's ever
picked it up. But the main ideas, the main lines of thought are actually relatively simple
to explain. So that's what I'm going to try and do in this video today and we're
going to get going with that right now. Ludwig Wittgenstein produced two great works
of philosophy, the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, published in 1921-22 and the Philosophical
Investigations, published posthumously in 1953. The Tractatus is a very, very unusual
work of philosophy. It's a remarkably short work for a great work of philosophy and that's
in part due to Wittgenstein's condensed writing style which has put off many readers and confused
a good number of philosophers. So Wittgenstein wanted to express himself in as concise and
as logical a way as possible. He was influenced in that by the work of the great logicians,
particularly Frager. Whether he was successful in this, well, you've got to read it and
judge for yourself. The Tractatus is also unusual in its layout, so its paragraphs use
a system of decimal notation which aims to make explicit whether a new paragraph expands
on the previous one or whether it's making a brand new point. The Tractatus contains
a range of different philosophical topics but we can divide it up into four main areas.
There's the metaphysics of objects, Wittgenstein's idea that the world is made up of facts, not
of things. Then there's his picture theory of language and related to that there's his
philosophical account of meaning and meaninglessness and then there's his reflections on the purpose
of philosophy. Before we go any further, I'd just like to jump in here and say I hope you're
enjoying this content. If you'd like to help me out to make more educational academic content
like this, go and take a look at my Ko-Fi page and see how you can help me out.
So let's start where the Tractatus starts with the metaphysics, the logical structure
of reality. The Tractatus begins with these words. The world is all that is the case.
The world is the totality of facts, not of things. The world is determined by facts and
by there being all the facts. For the totality of facts determines what is the case and also
whatever is not the case. You see what I mean about this being really complicated to read?
What on earth does Wittgenstein mean by that? Well really what he's talking about here is
the way the world is, okay? By fact Wittgenstein doesn't mean something in language, a true
sentence like we would often say that's a fact. He means something like a state of
affairs, something in the world. The world being a certain way, like I am sitting down
right now, that is one fact. It's sunny outside in Nottingham right now, that is another fact.
These are all different facts and together Wittgenstein says these facts make up the
world what we mean by reality. And the contrast here that he brings out is it's not just
things or objects that make up reality, you know me, you, the camera and stuff like that.
Because if we just had things we would just have a collection of stuff, right? What's
important when we think about reality is not just the things but the way those things are,
the properties they have like me sitting down, like the camera being on and the relationships
between them. I'm talking into the camera, you're watching me talk into the camera and
so on. All of these facts together make up the totality of reality. So this way of thinking
of the world breaking it down into its constituent facts is basically related to the logical
atomism that Wittgenstein developed alongside his teacher Bertrand Russell, Russell taught
Wittgenstein when Wittgenstein was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the early decade of the 20th
1912 he started there and they became friends and they worked closely together on philosophy
developing this idea of logical atomism. So atomism in general is the view that the world
is made up of distinct units of existence and logical atomism adds to the view that this
view has arrived at through logical means rather than through empirical investigation through
logical means we can break down facts into their basic constituents.
And really this is one of the peculiar traits of Wittgenstein's approach. In the Tractatus he
simply insists that if thought and language are to represent the world then thought language in
the world must be structured in the same way. This would only be possible according to Wittgenstein
if there were basic units of existence the states of affairs that could be picked out by the
basic elements of our language the primitive propositions the picture theory. So Wittgenstein
puts forward what he calls the picture theory of meaning the idea very roughly speaking is that
the function of language is to form pictures or models of reality that's how language gets its
meaning. So Wittgenstein develops an account of how language works of how it gets its meaning
based on an analogy with the way he thinks about pictures. So although pictures can have many
purposes it really helps to focus in on a very basic type of picture or diagram like you know
if I'm trying to show you the way to drive to my house I might sketch you a quick diagram.
And to do that I don't have to include every detail along the way like you know what the
view is going to look like or anything like that I might just draw a very basic diagram
showing you like here's where you live here's the road in between here's where I live and like
there's the traffic lights you're going to turn left at the lights and I might draw this by putting
little arrows on the road or whatever. So a diagram like this presents a situation to us according
to Wittgenstein it tells us that certain things of the case and certain other things are not the
case. So suppose my diagram indicates that to get to my house you've got to take the second right
after the lights the diagram is presenting a situation in which my house is on that very road
it tells us that it's not the case that my house is the second left after the lights.
So this is basically what Wittgenstein means when he says a picture is a model of reality.
So in constructing a picture like this we're not constrained by what is actually the case
okay by the facts by the actual facts. Although my house is on the second road on the right let's say
I'm perfectly able to draw a diagram in which the house is on the second left after the lights.
So the situation that a picture presents thus exists in logical space according to Wittgenstein.
It's existing in the space of all possibilities not necessarily just corresponding to the actual
situation of how things really are. A picture represents a possible situation when the structure
of the picture mirrors the structure of that situation. Okay so in our example that would
mean that when I draw parallel lines quite close together in the diagram they're representing
the road and when I draw a little symbol with a little kind of hat on it that's going to represent
the house and a little rectangle that I draw with some circles in it that's going to represent the
traffic lights and you know if I put some arrows on it they're not really representing any feature
of reality other than that's the way you should go to get to my house. So here we have various
symbols corresponding to objects in reality and moreover the way in which the symbols are related
in the picture mirrors the way in which the corresponding objects are related in the given
situation real or merely possible. So in this way Wittgenstein says the meaning and the truth
or the falsity are two different aspects of the picture so the meaning or as Wittgenstein sometimes
calls it the sense of the picture is the situation that it represents whereas on the other hand the
agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality constitutes its truth or falsity. So
we can usually tell what a picture means just by looking at it if we're familiar with the
notation that's being used but in order to tell whether a picture is true or false we must compare
it with reality we must actually look and see what the picture represents and whether that's
actually the case or not. So according to Wittgenstein language works in pretty much exactly the same
way so we're setting up this analogy between language the way language works and the way
pictures represent reality. So according to Wittgenstein in the Tractatus language gets its
meaning pretty much wholly by representing possible states of affairs in logical space.
Meaning and nonsense so according to the picture theory it's the job of meaningful language to
picture actual possible states of affairs. So for Wittgenstein logic sets the limits to meaning
the tautologies and contradictions of logic are not themselves meaningful they are limiting cases
without sense. Wittgenstein treats mathematics the same way but other cases have an even deeper
grade of meaninglessness being utterly nonsensical. To understand them Wittgenstein says we should
have to be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere outside logic that is to say
outside the world and Wittgenstein thinks that a consequence of this is that language which
doesn't picture any concrete state of affairs is going to be meaningless. So one of the main
aims of the Tractatus it becomes apparent is to show what is meaningful and what is not. So in the
preface to the Tractatus Wittgenstein writes this book will draw a limit to thinking or rather not
to thinking but to the expression of thoughts. The limit can only be drawn in language and what
lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense. So here Wittgenstein includes any talk
about value including ethics, religion and philosophy itself. Language can't meaningfully
address these issues Wittgenstein thinks that value somehow lies outside the world and famously he
says the limits of language mean the limits of my world and in particular as Wittgenstein was very
well aware the Tractatus itself is meaningless. The very theory that Wittgenstein seems to be
putting forward here about how language gets meaning is itself meaningless by its own likes.
Wittgenstein is very aware of this but that doesn't mean that he thinks that philosophy itself is
pointless. According to Wittgenstein the Tractatus is an elucidatory activity by this he means that
anyone who comes to understand the Tractatus thereby understands that it's senseless but since
understanding has been achieved one no longer needs the propositions of the Tractatus he must so to
speak throw away the ladder after he has climbed up on it. So in this way it doesn't matter that
the Tractatus is meaningless its value is in the activity of reading through it thinking through
it and coming to understand it not in its content. So a key idea here for Wittgenstein is the distinction
that he draws between saying and showing so according to Wittgenstein often we can't say
such and such but we can show it so according to Wittgenstein there are important things that
we can't meaningfully say in language but nevertheless we can show them. Wittgenstein says
what finds its reflection in language language cannot represent what expresses itself in language
we cannot express by means of language. Propositions show the logical form of reality they display it
by showing that a number of propositions that we might otherwise take to be meaningful are actually
nonsense Wittgenstein hoped that philosophy could lead to the clarification of our thoughts.
So what Wittgenstein's trying to do here really is to show that there are a number of propositions
that we might otherwise take to be meaningful but to be philosophically problematic and what he's
really trying to show us here is that really these propositions are just meaningless right and then
if they're meaningless well they can't really be problems because if they were problems we would
be able to meaningfully express those problems in language but we can't so they're not the purpose
of philosophy this according to Wittgenstein is the object of philosophy okay so Wittgenstein's
conception of philosophy really differs from many traditional views of what philosophy is which go
right back to ancient times so on many conceptions of philosophy what we're trying to do is we're
trying to use rational thought to clarify problems and to solve problems to come to an
understanding of the way reality is perhaps in its most fundamental aspects by using our rational
thought to solve those problems but that's not how it is on Wittgenstein's conception of what
philosophy is rather for Wittgenstein philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity a
philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations philosophy does not result in
philosophical propositions but rather in the clarification of propositions so Wittgenstein
then concludes with his seventh thesis to which he offers no further explanation where of one cannot
speak there of one must be silent the empiricist interpretation okay so let's break off for a
moment from what Wittgenstein says in The Tract Artist to one way in which it can be interpreted
and whether that interpretation is right or wrong so there's an influential interpretation of The
Tract Artist that tries to place it along empiricist lines so empiricism in philosophy it's a viewpoint
in epistemology in the theory of knowledge that says ultimately all our knowledge and understanding
of the world comes from our experience we don't have any a priori knowledge that we get you know
independently of our experience to understand the world to gain knowledge we have to go out there
and really experience the world from scratch without any experience our mind is just a blank slate
to be filled up and then systematized with experience so one person who attempts this
empiricist interpretation of The Tract Artist was Carl Popper who was an influential flotter of
science okay so he attempts to interpret The Tract Artist as an empiricist doctrine Popper
sums up The Tract Artist as follows all genuine or meaningful propositions were truth functions of
the elementary or atomic propositions which described atomic facts which could be in principle
established or rejected by observation okay so that's a pretty accurate summary of The Tract
Artist up to the point where we get to which could in principle be established or rejected by
observation so this last bit is added by Popper and it's not in The Tract Artist the phrase
observation statement which is a key idea in empiricism doesn't occur anywhere in The Tract
Artist. Wittgenstein just isn't really concerned with epistemology he's not concerned really with
the theory of knowledge he hardly talks about it at all it seems to me that Wittgenstein made a
purposeful decision to exclude any discussion of any epistemic any matters relating to the theory
of knowledge from The Tract Artist okay and because of that we can't really attribute this epistemic
interpretation of The Tract Artist to Wittgenstein I just don't think it's an accurate understanding
of what Wittgenstein was trying to do at all nevertheless the empiricist interpretation of
the picture theory of meaning was itself influential as an understanding of The Tract
Artist so the the empiricist interpretation it was picked up by the logical positivist
philosophers of the Vienna Circle so that's including philosophers like Maurice Schlich,
Frederick Weissmann and Rudolf Carnap so these philosophers they assumed that Wittgenstein was
supporting the verification principle the principle that only those propositions that are empirically
verifiable are meaningful so according to verificationists according to the verificationist
principle there's a large class of propositions including ones about ethics and theology and
philosophy that aren't verifiable and hence aren't meaningful now Wittgenstein does agree with this he
does agree that there's a large class of propositions you know including ethics and theology and lots
of philosophy and that stuff just isn't meaningful but Wittgenstein gets to this conclusion for rather
different reasons than the verificationists he's not really an adherent of the verificationist
principle he's got quite a different theory of meaning he doesn't say that for something to
be meaningful it has to be verifiable rather he's saying I've got this picture theory of meaning
that sets out the limits of meaning and whatever lies on the other side of those limits is meaning
less so Wittgenstein is not really a verificationist the tractatus is one of the masterpieces of
analytic philosophy in terms of its influence on later philosophy the picture is kind of difficult
to assess not least because it wasn't that long from the publication of the tractatus to the
publication of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations where he basically takes back
a lot of the viewpoints that he expresses in the tractatus so he was basically disavowing
his own philosophy and I think it's fair to say that Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations
and the picture of philosophy that he presents in the philosophical investigations really set the tone
for analytic philosophy philosophy of language in the second half of the 20th century so in some
sense the philosophical investigations overshadowed the influence of the tractatus nevertheless
there are lots of individual bits of the tractatus that went on to influence important bits of
analytic philosophy on the metaphysics side there is the metaphysics of states of affairs which
influence people like David Armstrong there's the account of meaning which went on to influence lots
of philosophers and linguists perhaps not the picture theory of meaning itself but Wittgenstein's
broader idea that we understand the meaning of a sentence in terms of its possible truth values
its truth conditions that's a really really influential idea in analytic philosophy of language
and linguistics the way we relate the meaning or content of a sentence to the possible situations
or the possible worlds at which that sentence is true that's a really influential idea in
mode logic and the kind of areas of philosophy that tie in nicely with mode logic so analytic
philosophy of language Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy is something that is ultimately
meaningless but that somehow it's okay to say that it's meaningless or rather to show that it's
meaningless I think has had a much more mixed reaction Frank Ramsey in his critical notice of
the tractatus I think expresses this idea this criticism the best when he says what we can't
say we can't say or we can't whistle it either so Wittgenstein was known at the time for being a
very proficient whistler he could whistle his way accurately through an entire symphony and what
Ramsey is really saying here is you know you can't have your cake and eat it you can't say that this
stuff this philosophy is somehow important but also say that it's meaningless right if it's
going to be important it has to mean something and you know I guess he's saying philosophy is important
and thus it is meaningful so Wittgenstein's theory that says philosophy isn't meaningful well
there's something wrong with that but you know I think this point brings out something very very
interesting about Wittgenstein's character and I guess in his self-belief as a person and as a
philosopher so if you or me I guess came up with a theory and then we realized that this theory had
this really crazy consequence we might say to ourselves hmm yeah that's probably a problem
for my theory I better go back to the drawing board and revise the theory Wittgenstein realized
that his picture theory has this crazy consequence that all the stuff he was saying is actually
meaningless but he really believed in what he was saying and he trusted his own ability as a
philosopher to such a degree that he could say well my theory tells us that everything we're
saying is meaningless and thus it is so all of this stuff is ultimately meaningless and he extracted
from that a whole way of looking at philosophy so ultimately I don't think that tells us that much
about philosophy itself but it does tell us something very interesting about Wittgenstein
as a thinker so there is so much more to say about Wittgenstein about his thought and about his
philosophy if you want to see some more videos about that go and have a look at this one over here
