Checking Aleš Zvolánek/GOIDA! Russians advocate for dialogue and reason! Ivan Okhlobystin.txt
 Your text seems to be a passionate call to action, inspired by the historical Russian interjection "Гойда!" (Goyda), which is traditionally used to rally people and signal an urgent call to arms or action. You're expressing a desire for contemporary society to embrace similar powerful and unifying cries in order to mobilize and face current challenges with the same vigor as in the past. The text also touches on themes of fighting for true values, beauty, and wisdom, while standing against the forces of "Satannists" (presumably a reference to those who hold views contrary to the author's own values). It's a rallying cry that evokes a sense of unity and determination in the face of perceived threats or challenges.
