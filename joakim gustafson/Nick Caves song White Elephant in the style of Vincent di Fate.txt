And the ride hunter sits on his porch, with his elephant gun in his tears.
Shoot you for free if you come around here.
Protest kneels on the neck of a statue, a statue says I can't breathe.
Protest says now you know how it feels and he kicks it into the sea.
I'm a Botticelli Venus with a penis riding an enormous scalloped fan.
I'm a sea foam woman rising from the spray, and I'm coming to do you harm.
With a gun in my pants full of elephant tears, and a sea horse on each arm.
With my elephant gun of tears, I'll shoot you all for free.
If you ever think of coming around here, I'll shoot you in the fucking face if you think of coming around here.
I'm an ice sculpture melding in the sun. I'm an ice sculpture with an elephant gun.
I'm an ice sculpture made of elephant sized tears, raining gas and salt upon your heads.
The president is cold in the feds, and I've been planning this for years.
I'll shoot you in the fucking face if you think of coming around here.
I'll shoot you just for fun. I'm a statue lying on my side in the sun with a memory of an elephant.
Evaporating before your eyes and becoming a great, great cloud of wrath, roaring my salt upon the earth.
I'll shoot you all for free if you so much as look at me.
