Okay. Well, there's just two more things I want to talk about quickly. One is speaking as we're
traveling down the road from intellectual heights, there's political correctness and group
think mentality, which you've attacked happily. And the notion that it's to some extent shame
once again comes in here. I was talking to Ian McEwen recently about his, he received a prize
and went to Israel and was castigated for that. And I know, of course, you've spoken out
against Israel's treatment of Palestinians. I have, but I'm Jewish and I see the right for
Israel to exist as a state and I have family who live in Tel Aviv and if I want to visit them,
I'll bloody well visit them. I will not be told not to. Exactly. Okay. So let's talk a little bit
about this curse of the combination of political correctness and virtue signaling that you cannot
say certain things now, which is the opposite of the enlightenment in some sense. Yeah. I mean,
I'm temperamentally a liberal, but a hand-wringing liberal, a milk toast liberal, an unsure,
worried, carpet-slip, a becardiganed, you know, Ian Forstery sort of a liberal. I'm not a hard
line lefty. I have a sympathy with a lot of social justice imperatives and quests and so on, but
I just want the left to be smarter than it is. I want it to be aware of how it's alienating,
well-meaning good people are just outraged and upset and frightened by the redaction of human
lives, you know, of a person being cast into outer darkness without trial, without due process,
for, you know, all kinds of reasons and for the language being used carelessly. Yes. Yeah, languages
can be a ticking bomb. You can occasionally, obviously, if you start talking about people's
cockroaches and so on, we're all aware of how, you know, racist language can be a vicious
precursor to racist behavior and to blood on the streets. But it is just language.
But, you know, I think I agreed to be on stage with Jordan Peterson as a debate. He's not someone
I necessarily agree with. I was surprised, but I guess I understood. I'd draw the line
at Ben Shapiro, I think. But Jordan Peterson, I thought, well, that's the point is to say, you
know, there are things I disagree with this man on, but I do agree with him on the fact that,
and from my point of view, it's because I actually lament the failure of the left. I think, yes,
the rise of bananism and of the the ought rise and its equivalence across Europe
is more a catastrophic failure of the left than a particular triumph of the right.
