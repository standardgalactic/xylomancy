Hello, and welcome to the Origins Podcast. I'm your host, Lawrence Krause.
Robert Sapolsky is a genius, or so says the MacArthur Foundation when they gave him a
genius grant. Whether he's a genius or not, I've known him personally and of his work
for many years and have always been impressed by both the depth and breadth of his work.
You can tell how accomplished a scientist he is by how many departments he's a member
of at Stanford. He's a professor of biology and neurology and I think neuroscience and
who knows what else at Stanford University. And he's worked on primates and neurobiology
and a host of other things, wrote a great book called Behave and he has a new book out
and the new book is called Determined, The Signs of Life Without Free Will. When I heard
about it, I wanted to speak to Robert. We've been for years trying to set up a time to
talk in general about aspects of neurobiology and this seemed like a good starting off point
and I got to read the book before it came out and it's a long book and for me it was
a challenge initially because as someone who recognizes that there is no such thing as
free will based on the laws of physics and has seen a host of books that I find rather
tedious about free will by some by people I've known, I was a little worried about reading
this but I knew that Robert always has gems to share and the book is chock full of his
own perceptions. It's fun just like he's fun and one can learn a lot about neurobiology
and then discuss the important question of once you accept that there is no such thing
as free will, he really takes on ahead first the more difficult question of what do you
do about responsibility and guilt and blame. So in any case we did what I love to do on
the Origins Project and we talked about his own origins and he and I shared four things
that I knew about and then we had a rollicking discussion of many aspects of free will,
neurobiology, society and consciousness as well as which is a subject I've written about
in my new book and I was happy to see that it passed muster with him, one of the experts.
It was a great discussion, he's a remarkable individual and really fun to listen to and
talk to. So I hope you'll enjoy listening to it and watching it, add free on our Origins Project
podcast on our critical mass website where paid subscribers will get to see the whole podcast
ad free. Of course you can listen to the podcast on any site that podcast can be listened to
and then eventually the video will come up on our YouTube channel, on our Origins Project
YouTube channel as well a few days later usually. No matter how you watch it or listen to it,
I certainly hope that you will be as thrilled and pleased and entertained and educated as I was
when I had my dialogue with Robert Sapolsky.
Well thanks so much for joining me Robert. We were saying before I pressed the record button
that we were amazed we actually never have been in the same room to our knowledge. We've crossed
past intellectually and as you know I admire and respect you tremendously. So it's such a thrill
finally after all this time to be able to have a long discussion. So thanks for coming on.
Well thanks for having me on the Respect is Mutual.
That's great, I appreciate it. This was no easy task in fact it's probably this
this was one of the hardest things I've had to do for many reasons. I want to talk about
your new book which by the time this airs will be I'm going to try and time it to the airing of
your new book. I have a pre-production version your book determined about free will. One of the
hardest things for me it was not an easy task to work through it for a variety of reasons.
There's a lot there first but also I come into this with the absolute conviction from everything
I know saying there's no such thing as free will. So it was hard for me you know accepting this fact
I thought well given that I don't you know think there's free will why am I really motivated to
go through this and that was hard at the beginning. But of course what's great is that our reasons for
my a priori regions for not thinking there was free will sort of are almost or not orthogonal but
don't have much overlap. You actually know how the brain works or at least a lot more than I do
and so your arguments really were quite useful. I don't think I needed them because basically
you and I both don't think there's a magic somewhere in the middle and that's really what
you need as we'll talk about. So that was one of the reasons I found it hard but the other is
there's a lot in this book because this book covers so many different interesting things
and that was the other part. I love your mind I've always loved your mind I love your writing
and I wonder what you think and it was just it was hard because it's a joy to read I wanted to
skip parts and I couldn't and the footnotes of which there are tremendous I as a rule I try not
to read footnotes in books but I read every footnote here because of course the footnotes are where
you get to put on all the stuff you where I really get to see how your mind works. In any case
it's it was worth the effort and I hope this discussion will be worth people's effort because
we're really going to go we're going to we're going to dig down and deep into into the ideas
as well as summarize but this is an origins podcast and I like to find out about people's
origins I'm particularly interested in yours what what led you to where you to the remarkable long
and winding road that you've taken with so many branches almost like a the emergent complexity
of of a neural neural system as we'll talk about your so I've read a little bit of your
biography that I could as much as I could find and I found out your your father was an architect okay
and and that clearly and he was an orthodox Jew your mother was I assume as well
the more we learned the more we realized coerced yeah okay oh interesting was she also he
was from Eastern Europe but he came from Eastern Europe yeah he came over just after the revolution
as a like young adolescent a very good time to get out of that area yeah she came over from the
old country as a fetus so okay she didn't she didn't remember as much stuff back there is
she was born in the States yeah okay and okay so that but now I want to I want to find out a
little I mean and you were brought up as an orthodox Jew okay now and one of the things I you
know I was born as a you know sort of in a secular Jewish household and brought up in that way
where I where the only thing I learned my mother kept telling me about good about being Jewish is
that you know learning was a big deal and reading she she tried to convince me that was a big
part of religion and but you obviously love learning and reading and of course
a lot of it's probably hardwired but but um who had the biggest influence you're so obviously your
father had an influence because you write about him I don't but I'd like to learn about your mother
too who for example as an architect when you were a kid I know you want you've loved gorillas
right away but what got you interested in that I don't know that and I'd like to
um I'm I'm not trying to get into two uh two murky and quicksandish of uh just for psychotherapy
but I was like eight when my mother my mother started taking me to museum and natural history
and it was an incredible percentage of field biologists I've encountered who like instead
of growing up out in the bush and these parents were missionaries or researchers they grew up in
some urban and at some point they they stumbled into the natural history museum that was it
that's that's the day they imprinted on geckos or whatever so um we went into the primate exhibit
somewhat randomly and if you ever go in there there's this stuffed mountain gorilla like right
at the entrance it may not be at the entrance anymore but like he's been on their postcards
forever and he was shot by like Carl Ackley in 1912 probably with Teddy Roosevelt and his gunbear
but it's this like diorama of this taxidermed mountain gorilla silverback
and like something clicked and if I'm going to get all all fuzzy here and stuff um
like both of my grandfather's died more than 50 years before I was born kind of thing and
never do anything and like something on some visceral level this just seemed like this would
be the greatest grandfather on earth and I just wanted to go live inside the diorama I think that's
that's what was going on there that's where it came from okay I was wondering there had to
been something that's where you grew up in New York and you know there's not a lot of
silverback gorillas at least non-metaphorical ones that's why I wanted to live in the diorama
I don't know about you but I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that Brooklyn has now
become a trendy place to live it was not then yeah yeah no it wasn't then exactly but uh but
you know it but it gave you that opportunity which as we'll talk about you know gave you good luck
and and and um and and had a huge influence now I understand where that came from um and you
basically did live in that diorama I mean you you willing willfully chose as soon as you could as
far as I can see to actually experience to go and for then for three decades to continue to try and
live in that diorama at some level yeah it really impressed me and amazed me and also made me envious
in some sense but I'll talk about privilege and good luck yeah yeah no well but you you know well
but for whatever reason you you took advantage of the privilege and good luck
um I would say it would be grit but I know better
but so so that's interesting so your mother actually had the biggest influence that way
what about reading I assume I'm always interested in in you know reading was vitally significant for
me and I'm always interested in what did you did you read a lot when you were a kid and if so
did that example come from either parent or no um oh I read obsessively and like I I guaranteed I was
going to be like kicked in the rear and schoolyard perpetually by I don't know in fourth grade like
who's your best friend essay and I said books are my best friend oh my god this kid has no
instinct for how not to just beg to be abused and bullied um yeah books were were pretty great
it's it's tempting to do a whole escapism thing but I just part of it was also just getting
padded on the head that this was like a nice metric for being a good good compliant boy
were they in that available in the house or I mean I mean uh or or not I mean what does that
an example or something you picked up again I'm interested just in comparing my to my notes to
myself in some ways to say um a fair number it was it was not quite a book obsessed house but there
was like a decent number there but once once libraries started to be a part of the picture
well we did have I do you remember the book of knowledge yeah of course oh my god we had the
book of knowledge and like I would get up early like on Sunday morning and just
read the book of where you could see like an article in there about like this newly finished
ship called the Titanic and is like this ancient is this phenomenal yeah no it's yeah I yeah I love
those things I and I and I end up getting a subscription to book of knowledge type stuff the
time life books I'm like remember that I'm a 20 volume thing was my first thing I spent my allowance
on it when I was a kid because because there were books in my house but not but not but not
yeah not enough times yeah yeah and so yeah one of them would show up like every six and they
smelled so good yeah yeah first came out of the box I still have them I still I just put them up
and I ain't I'm never gonna get rid of them because it it means so much thought there's so you know
and of course they're outdated but that's what's great to great to that's what's great about
science is they're outdated it actually makes progress and they admitted somewhere afterward
that that was wrong yeah yeah exactly that's the being wrong as well you know I I talked about that
my new book I think admitting you're wrong and not knowing is a key part of science um now okay so
now I see where the sort of background by the way as orthodox Jewish whether your mother was
coursed in or not did they did they have plans for you I mean my mother wanted me to be a doctor
my brother to be a lawyer but did they did they want that kind of thing for you was there did you
feel any pressure to be a professional in that way um frantic ceaseless crushing heartless pressure
to become a doctor yeah okay where my my wife and I have like tried to figure out the chronology
because it was a long time ago but we think this is the case uh that my father started off in med
school like in the second year of the depression and there's going to be a cancer but and ran out of
money and uh never finished um like we've we've got his like stethoscope and microscope in the back
of some closet upstairs from 1930 whatever um you know there there's a couple of possible holes
in the story but at least that that can hold together broadly so he uh you know he knew how
to do drafting he had gone to stuyvesant high school in New York and like we're gonna do that
so he got a job doing that in an architectural firm and then decided to start going architectural
night school and before it was over with he was a professor of architecture kind of thing but
yeah not quite daily but not far from about the highest possible calling would be to go
like be a doctor and cure cancer all right well okay that's it did he talk to you much about I mean
did he talk to you much about science or his or his interests or didn't I mean no that doesn't
kids often forget to ask their parents what they're saying but um
they came and sort of frenzied monologues um he was he was a very very large presence but
he was not a very approachable one uh you know he'd he'd had a tough time of things and uh
like he was doing his best yeah yeah but well he obviously did and it's it's interesting to see
that that pressure came from a different place for him for me and I've already said this a bunch
times so I think in different contexts my neither my parents finished high school but but the eye
and for them there was especially important to be a doctor because it represented you know going
beyond and and and and uh and and I again when I got my first I got a fancy job at Harvard and I
never forget my my mother phoned my my then wife at the time and immediately said he still can go
to medical school there's still time uncanny I had the same when I was getting like trying to pick
where I was going to go have a job I got an offer from like Cornell med school I'm a neuro there
and so well I'm considering it and come back to New York whatever and they said that would be a good
inside connection if you decide oh that is freakish that you know that is that's amazing oh
I'm glad I brought it up I wasn't gonna but that's yeah that is freakish now you well I have to ask
you this did you did you learn Swahili I mean I know you started till did you ever like did you
learn enough to yes I'm I'm terrible at languages but it was just kind of by force I became sort of
functionally fluent by about my fifth or sixth year there and all is done is decay since then
I I took Swahili for two years in college and it being the times that it was the book was entirely
written for like African Americans thinking about root stuff so it was mostly like learning how to
talk about Charlie Parker and Swahili stuff okay well at least and it turned out that the instructor
was Tanzanian so I learned Tanzanian Swahili which is like showing up in the Bronx speaking the
Queens English or something to Kenya but you know I was I was eventually able to get by but I'm
I'm pretty bad languages I should have pointed out I mean people may wonder if who don't know
why I even brought that up but you actually decided when you were still a teenager or early
a teenager that in addition to learning about if you wanted to learn about gorillas you would learn
so you started to learn Swahili when you were in your early teens right um yeah yeah that's
I was writing fan letters to various primatologists when I was in high school and eventually got to
sit at the feet of one for four years and that was a major disappointment
yeah I sort of was intent I think I had to have been the only like Jewish kid in Brooklyn in the
1970s sitting on the west side independent train the B train reading a biography of Joe Mo Kenyatta
day after day yeah that would have gotten some it would be interesting to see what would happen
today if you're doing that it's a different world but um you went so you that that it was kind of
natural then to major um you went to Harvard right and did biological anthropology yeah and um
and and you know and that's sort of I guess biological anthropology I'm wondering why it
wasn't like um uh more I mean biological anthropology is not directly focused on on primates you
could have done primatology and I'm wondering what what what well at the time this was just at the
time that like the great sociobiology shits the worm hit in fact it was amazing it was a
beolson did you take classes from him or something or my first semester is when he published sociobiology
and yeah like spending college like arguing about whether he or luenton made sense and
it was incredibly stimulating time um you know at the time a bioanthro included primatology they
shortly after that things had bad enough and there had been enough like
drive-by shootings between the social anthro people and the bioanthro people that they split
into two departments but yeah that was that was good to do both yeah and it's probably you know
and you and as you say and and it's clear I mean you are one of the things I admire and I'm jealous
of is you know I've always liked the idea of being a generalist and you you have you've been a
generalist in it in you know in a clear way I mean we achieving levels of levels in a
in a wide variety of fields and it's nice that you could start that general as generalization
with bioanthro and it was it was and it was a low-profile department so you could get away with
like just happening not to take all sorts of requirements and things and it was it was nobody
paid attention to their part and then it was very quiet um it's sort of around then that I
then started my like am I a neurobiologist or primatologist crisis because said primatology
God at whose feet I was sitting uh got sick my freshman year um he was fine everything but he
canceled all of his classes including a couple I was going to take and sort of at the last minute
saying yeah maybe I'll take an intro neuro class uh they probably they probably have something to
say about behavior instead of just us evolutionary biologists that was blown away by it and like
ever since deciding am I a neurobiologist or am I a primatologist and sort of that was
that so you anticipated my question because I was wondering if you did by you know biological
anthropology and you like primates why you then went to do uh you know your phd in in neurobiology
and and now that I guess that's the reason I would seem like a jump but uh and sort of by then the
way that the totally intellectually fabricated way that I saw them as connected is like I go study
behavior and stuff in baboons and exactly at the point where I would say wow what's going on inside
not going to lesion disguise hippocampus because like I've known him for years and his mother was
great um so I'll go do stuff to rats in a lab and just what I'm learning about the brain there and
saying huh I wonder if this works in like real animals out in the real world I get to go back to
the baboon so they were synergistic um you know I couldn't decide which yeah actually I was well I
guess it's because of the love of the bamboos or the great apes that because I was going to say
you know I've I actually just had a discussion with Peter Singer and and who uh who's lovely
interesting talk to and we talked about animal experimentation and and and some of the silly
things that have been done in the name of psychology on animals the torturing of animals that didn't
you know in order to try and understand who humans work when it was clear often that if you
wanted to really understand how humans work you probably should examine humans and and and and
you know and certain certain torturing of rats was probably not going to give you huge insights
into post-traumatic stress syndrome and humans and stuff but but uh but I was but you didn't want
but you know you could have chosen to work on humans but you just found apes more interesting
um I would say more understandable but maybe the word is more palatable or more
ah well I wanted to get out and do field work somewhere in the middle of nowhere
yeah no I can understand that you know and in your general you you you are lucky to have a
position that that actually explicitly demonstrates your your generalness um so I mean again I
always wanted but I didn't always because I wanted to I started a degree in history and well as as
well as physics but I quickly learned that the intellectual baggage required me to do a degree
in mathematics as well as physics and that took up all the time but but you you have you have
professors in biological sciences neurology and this really always amazed me neurological
science and neurosurgery and and and my mother would have been very happy if I was a professor of
neurosurgery but whoa you better bet I trotted that out when I went back for Hanukkah yeah you
know what you know yeah I think at one point the neurosurgery department had some sort of
visiting committee and they suggested they needed a little more basic researchers in the
department so I was friends with the chief of neurosurgery who said hey can we put your name
on the letterhead oh ever since then I've been a member of the department I I have to say at one
point I was vice dean of the medical school of Case Western Reserve for about six months but
and I don't think I ever told my mother I worried about what that would imply so
but um but you know it did intrigue me so your professor I mean and it and it's quite
appropriate given all of the breadth of your the lovely connections you make between neurobiology
and and behavior of of human behavior and and behavior of of great apes it's it is a lovely
symbiotic relationship and it's and I guess it took someone like you to realize it was that that
was useful I'm intrigued that you and I guess I'm intrigued and impressed that among that collection
of departments in which your professor psychology isn't one of them and I was wondering I was intrigued
by that um that's a good question nor is anthropology there although if they've also purged
like virtually everyone except the social and cultural anthropologists so that that that war
has been won there um I don't know I talk to psychologists I can I can occasionally
say the right nouns and get away with it but yeah clearly some of the stuff I've done has
involved my having to like interact with them a lot yeah yeah no it's interesting to me that
anyway let we'll get we'll you people will see when we talk about the context of trying to address
this question of free will which I want to now move to you mentioned you obviously you've agonized
I guess that's the right way to put it you've thought about free will for a long time obviously
and agonizing I said by agonizing I don't think the agonizing was I suspect you recognized
like me that there was that there was no obvious obvious scientific reason why
there should be free will but so maybe didn't agonize by the science but you agonized to
try and understand how to how to demonstrate explicitly or address this question how long
you've been thinking about is an issue that's always that's always bothered you or um
well I think once I started getting acne that was right around the time when logical things
happened like I was having all sorts of like angst and the contradictions of and you know during
one sort of particularly trotated here I woke up at two in the morning one night and said oh I get it
God doesn't exist what's going on and then shortly after that was oh and there's no free will
and that was followed by and it's a totally empty empty indifferent universe so that cured
everything right there and lessened all the different for me too I I didn't I'm gonna try to
end epiphany that way in fact I meant to ask you that you I noticed that age 13 is when you
when you kind of made that it's real had this realization at least that's what your this bio
says age 13 I I for me it was a gradual thing but I actually sort of became it I mean age
13 was when I broke bar mitzvah and now what the that experience enough was enough to turn me off
religion forever if I hadn't if it hadn't already been that way was it was the age 13 a coincidence
for you too or no uh no not at all of of course I would say just from focusing on the ways in
which often ancient and well-established cultures have influenced your life and in which the purpose
of every generation is to inculcate their offspring into the same cultural values uh you know age
13 is when they're really pressing court on that one yeah so that's kind of when inevitably the
this doesn't make any sense and this isn't right so now you mentioned it though it shows that they
understood neuroscience a little bit because you point out how in fact the prefrontal cortex and
I mean it's that period when things are developing so if you're going to inculcate
that's probably a really good time to do it and especially do it in a way where they somehow
make you feel guilty for a pogrom that happened in the 15th century yeah so the very reason you
could do right now is make your children has to put that as well yeah well guilt is a huge part of
that I think but you know it's interesting when you said you smiled when you went and cured everything
when you woke up in the middle of the night and I want to follow that up we'll come back
in near the end of this six or seven hour discussion um uh to this question because
almost you almost apologize or make it appear as if recognizing that there's no free will
is and should be a depressing thing but one could often say and I'm often asked that I mean
isn't recognizing there's no meaning no cosmic meaning to the universe and no god
also a depressing thing and we'll talk about its impact on morals because you talk about that
but for me it was exactly the opposite and maybe it's just the wiring it it was it's liberating
and and and and energizing to know both of those things because it makes sort of it makes you
understand your place and it makes every moment in some ways more precious if you understand that
there's nothing guiding it and there's no and and that you're here for a short time and and your
delta set of cards and um and and that's life and you might as well use it well you're you're
made of more resilient stuff than me somebody somebody did right by you leading up to that point
or somebody's nutrient level when you were a fetus did right by you but yeah that's the notion
I mean this is um um I just agreed to blurb a manuscript for a book of someone a scientist who
experienced just a horrendous nightmares family tragedy and the book is about like
how he is found comfort in science and I sure can't wait to read it because like how'd he do that
science just seemed like the only intellectually sustainable default states to try to understand
things but it sure does not give comfort much yeah well I guess again it's all in it's long
all in the attitude I I do I since we're both atheists in that sense but I obviously for some
reason or other I've been labeled it it's it's higher in my profile and because I've spent time
trying to protect things like the teaching revolution in schools and got got involved in that
because the biologists weren't doing it enough in my opinion that's why right right you you died for
our sins yeah but uh but because of that um I spent a lot of time talking to people about this
issue and I I do think that that that real that realizing one talks about loss of faith and even
that that's already propaganda or that's already promoting a reality that doesn't need to be it's
not a lot you don't lose anything you gain I think and if you indicate people that you can gain by
making every you know recognizing every moment's more precious if you have a mentality and you
recognize it then you don't have to then then then you gain anyway I think I that's the kind of
you know if I'm going to do a feel good or try to try to be a you know um I don't try to be advice
or a uh one of those kind of advice scientists but but but but if I did I mean that's what I think
that's the that's the argument and I'm going to try and argue it later on I I I I struggled a lot
with the last half of this book because I could see your angst we'll get to it um but I think
there's I I can see a happy way out and maybe it isn't but we'll see if I we'll see if you think
about it well I I think I finally it took me like a huge amount of time to get to the end there
because like how can this not just be well this sucks and is pretty demoralizing but
you know we're adults that's the way the word to see that there is actually a good feature of it
and a liberating one um I sure can't convince myself of it most of the time and not only did I
write the damn book I read it even at various points um yeah it's a it's a hard pull but it's
kind of it's reminding me of that great rebranding that atheism has tried to do in recent years
we are not just about what isn't we are not just a theist we're not just like saying I don't believe
there's a god and as long as we're at it I don't believe there's an Easter Bunny no it's a positive
and the whole rebranding is humanism and to be able to say like the source of human goodness
is human that's that's not just saying you know it wasn't in seven days that the world got created
and like smoothing is probably not a good thing most of the time um yeah there's the
there's rooms for for positivity in there yeah I think well I think you know well I think
as I'll argue as you know and I was reminded of a quote from my friend my late friend
Christopher Hitchens here I mean I don't think we have a choice um ultimately and and and I think
that we we should you know I'm getting ahead of myself but in some sense part of the last part
of the book is saying well we have how can we we we we wanting there to be free will and believing
their free will is so is so ingrained how can we get over it but I think we just recognize that
that that not not thinking not thinking in terms of free will is just part of the way we're wired
to and that's we don't have the we don't have the choice to not want to not emotionally want
there to be free will we have the we don't have any choice I'll agree with you there but but we
can intellectually through through learning will argue at some level recognize rationally that there
isn't but but I think you know recognizing that we don't have the free will to not to not emotionally
believe in free will is just something we have to accept I think and should not struggle with
to some extent I mean Robert Robert Rivers like one of the pioneering social biologists
during one period got very interested in publishing stuff on the evolution of the
capacity for self deception essentially saying if you're going to have a species that can know the
future like the only way you're going to get up in the day is the ability for self deception
interestingly equally interesting is the notion that evolution of self deception because
the best way to convince people of your laws is to believe your laws and competition and all of
that so he got very interested in that but just the very notion that if you're going to be this smart
it's a pretty helpful thing oh yeah yeah well I always say we all every one of us has to believe
six impossible things for our breakfast just to get up you like your colleagues you like your job
you like your spouse whatever it is but you know you just got to get out of bed and and and that's
okay I mean but but a great thing is to recognize it's okay to recognize it's an illusion but but
to but to recognize it doesn't diminish the fact that we know we have it and to say and almost
revel in it but anyway let's get let's get to you know I could have spent a time talking about
the last book Behave which is a precursor to this but this book Determined is about
free will and by the way it seemed to me not only have you agonized about it for years
when did you really start to think about it it was when you realized that there's no god at the
same time as when you began to think yeah and then and then you've actually also put your not your
money well you may have money where your mouth is you've actually gotten involved and if in
consequently if there is no free will then there's a question of responsibility and punishment
which we'll get to and you've gotten involved in prisons in court cases and really taken this on
which I really admire as well I you've internalized it or at least shown that well before it's
lauded I should just basically say it's a totally fun hobby because it's a totally fun hobby you
find out about some of the most horrific things that can happen to people and as a result of that
damage some of the most horrific things they could do to other people and like what totally broken
system it is blah blah blah but it's kind of like it's cool trying to convince 12 skeptics who are
getting to decide whether or not this person is going to be in jail for life to think differently
it almost never works and it's cool to have a smart DA during cross-examination who wants to
argue it so you know it's another version of that but well it's okay I always tell people
what you're saying is just simply you have to enjoy what you're doing I tell people that
most scientists most scientists you know don't become scientists to save the world
you cure cancer or whatever they do it because they it's cool and they like it and it's in the
process if something good comes out of it that's great that's great too but because dry ice is just
like fun to play with exactly yeah magnets and all the rest that's why I often ask people why they
didn't become physicists I was going to say because it's why it's so neat why didn't anyway by the
way did you ever did did you ever toy with that the physical sciences or as always biological
sciences that you always biological and always like cutting every corner to like avoid the
chemistry requirements and stuff just just not my temperament I've had to spend years and years
filling in the the crater holes of where I didn't get the basic information that's okay that's okay
because you know that's what it's for I you know I learned a lot more physics after I got my phd
then before anyway but you know that's where you yeah it's all right because that's called
lifelong learning now the basic premise of determined basically that there are you know
and and and you might say why is this why is there so much here to just say two things there's no
uncaused decision making no decision is made by some magical thing it's always caused by series
of causes which then have causes which then as you said at the beginning of the book turtles all the
way down and the second is that if that's the case then what then respond the notion of responsibility
for your decision making if if there's if there's no random no spontaneous decision making if there's
no free will if everything is based on on on some physical biological chemical process then
then we have to re we have to renounce or at least rethink what we mean by taking responsibility
for our actions those are the two if I were to summarize is that a reasonable summary of of
the of the general context of the book yes okay um and now having done that well well I want to unpack
it and there's a lot to unpack um um and um and uh and I did I have to say you know I was cursing
you last night when I was reading the last hundred pages and and I was staying up all night
um but uh but I had took I took solace from the realization that I had no choice in the
matter and and do you know the quote from I was alluding to it from chris rations when
it was asked about free will do you know his quote he said he said yes I have free will I have no
choice but that's wrong but I think if we just said yes I feel I have free will I have no choice
that'd be right now it's from you have like one of the theological loops for getting to that
I can't remember Aquinas or who knows what or no doubt someone much more closed-minded than that
saying like God is so glorious so amazing and having granted us free will that we have no choice
but to worship it uh
perfect that captures it yeah um yeah that's great I gotta remember that's good well look I
periodically I'm going to read quotes of yours because I like them and it'll allow me a chance
to give you a chance to expand upon them obviously not as much detail as the book but at least give
a sense um but basically right off and in the very beginning um uh where you talk about turtles
all the way down you say to reiterate when you behave in a particular way which is to say
when your brain has generated a particular behavior it is because of the determinism
that came just before which was caused by the determinism just before that and before that
all the way down the approach of this book is to show how that determinism works to explore how
the biology over which you had no control interacting with environment over which you
had no control made you you and when people claim that there are causeless causes of your behavior
that they call free will they have a fail to recognize or not learned about the determinism
lurking beneath the surface and or be erroneously concluded that the rarefied aspects of the universe
that do work indeterministically can explain your character morals and behavior now um
so the point is you see you know to say that that things are deterministic is fine and then
it'd be a very short book and a lot of people have written not so short books that basically
don't say any more than that and I won't alert to some to some of those people um but you want to
talk about the biology of this and and I think that the neurobiology of it and I think that's what
makes it incredibly enlightening enlightening to learn about this but but you you basically
um uh come down to say okay you need to look at all of science uh to do this and as a generalist
you uh you you uh you it fits you in your your sort of natural predilections crucially all
discipline all these disciplines and you talk about many disciplines collectively negate free
will because they are all interlinked constituting the same ultimate body of knowledge if you talk
about the effects of neurotransmitters on behavior you are also implicitly talking about the genes
that specify the construction of those chemical messengers and the evolution of those genes the
field of neurochemistry genetics and evolutionary biology can't be separated and it goes on so
so this notion that that there's this biological basis requires us and we'll talk about each of
those aspects particularly but but but logically you frame the argument as there's free there's
sort of four complementary ways of thinking and I want to get you sort of to elaborate on that you
say we have a choice the world is deterministic and there's no free will the world is deterministic
and there is free will the world is not deterministic and there's no free will and the world is not
deterministic and there is free will so um we're gonna we're gonna unpack those more carefully but
do you want to do you want to give it a sort of a an expansion of those of of of each of those
areas and what the central concepts of why there are fallacies in some and not others yeah um and
you know two by two matrix where two of the four are a lot more interesting than the other two
one of them makes no sense at all which is the world is not deterministic but you don't have
free will and I don't quite know how you get there and I don't think I've read anyone that's just
making sure like fill out the matrix there the there is not determinism and there is free will
is this somewhat off in the ozone view of libertarian philosophy libertarian in an
intellectual sense rather than political and you know I got pulled into reading any of this
philosophy stuff kicking and screaming but it appears to be like a very minority view
um the most common one is that yeah yeah it's a deterministic world I'm not a
I'm not a lot I'm not a whatever yet there's like atoms and we're made of cells and like
there's rules through the physical universe and stuff but somehow somehow somehow somehow
that's compatible with us still having free will and this compatibilism one is what I spend
like most of the book here tearing my hair out because what the polls show is 90 95 percent
of philosophers say that they are deterministic compatible lists and like a shocking number
of neuroscientists when you really back them up in a corner and you try to get them to look at
what it is that they just said or advocated um but it's this notion that yeah of course
like I'm a modern 21st century all of that um and we're made of stuff and the universe has rules
and all but somehow somehow somehow there's room for this intangible thing to still be lurking
in there and that's the essence that's the us of us and that's the us of us that gives us agency
and of course the fourth truly lunatic fringe version of the matrix is the one that I'm saying
which is it's a completely deterministic world and there's no free will whatsoever
compatibilism is incompatible with the way the world works okay great and a premise which I
which I agree with as a physicist and I was you know so I have my will get to the
some of the physical arguments but it's so it's for me it's wonderful to see the biological basis
as well but but as a physicist so it seems to me that that that's clear the the it's certainly
interesting that 90 percent of the we'll get to it we'll get to the fact that you spend a lot of
time it doesn't say much about philosophy um which is fine because um you know and uh and by the way
it's not just me you know some people think I trash philosophy too much but I again was talking to
Peter Simmer singer who's a philosopher and it was unfunded it was fun to see him trash
philosophy because a lot of philosophers talk about how animals don't have rights because
it's clear they don't have rights I mean as if as if there's you know and and we'll get to it but
it's almost low hanging fruit in some some ways to see the arguments that that are presented okay
that's great that that that puts the put things in context but you actually mentioned and I think
it's worthwhile saying what do you mean by free will and what do you mean by determinism the next
thing you talk about that and so give it a chance to sort of briefly explain what you mean by free
will and what you mean by determinism well this is where everybody like spends half the conference
on arguing about yeah definitions and stuff um but I think well maybe the place to start defining
free will um is what it's not even though lots of people go through this and this is a super
influential way of seeing free will where there isn't because it's one of what runs through the
entire criminal justice system you got somebody on trial and essentially trials revolver and three
questions did this person after they figure out what the person did did the person intend to do it
did they know what the consequences were likely to be and did they understand that there were
alternatives they could have done something else and if the answer those are yes that's it
the person showed free will and lock them up um and an equivalent myopia has run through sort of
one field of like neurobiologists thinking about free will and this is from this like landmark
famous experiment in the 1980s by benjamin libitt and you've read any damn paper on the
biology film by this second paragraph out comes libitt and you want to screen libitt's the one
who's done that study that's the famous one he sat people down and basically said here do this do
this behavior and do it whenever you feel like it press this button and you know whenever you feel
like it and we're going to hook you up to all sorts of like modern ways to see what's going on in
your brain and your muscles and all of that and adibit came this incredible finding so you put
people in there and like you're monitoring what's happening in their brains when they decide to do
something and what they reported was at the moment that someone said that's when i got the
intention to press the button you could already tell from their brain like up to a few seconds
before that they had decided to push the button oh my god everybody learned neuroscientists have
just shown your brain knows before you do with of course this ridiculous like dichotomy there
but like people have been fighting about it ever since was the do can you tell the difference between
when you intend to do something and when you know that you intend to do it and was there a better
way of measuring the milliseconds and like like there's still papers being published saying things
like libitt had his head up as he was so wrong like 40 years later people were still fighting over it
because it's essentially the question of when you believe you intend to do something
has this imaginary separate construct your brain already decided to do it and
both in that route and in the courtroom that's the most ridiculously useless thing to do
because like the metaphor i use it's like trying to review a movie based on only
seeing the last three minutes of it because whether it's in the courtroom or whether it's
hanging with libitt and his detractors in both cases you're not asking the critical question
yes he says the guy intended to do this and we could have done other yes he says the person did
or didn't intend before this part of their brain had a bunch of action potentials where did that
intent come from and if you're going to talk about free will you're not off the hook if you just
say the person intended to do that where did that intent come from why did that psych 101
freshman show up to do this experiment for libitt that day instead of like coming in and stealing
the guy's laptop and sneaking out why was that where does intent come from and the answer is
as you figure that out that's where any semblance of free will goes down the drain
okay that's great that's that's great let me let me i was going to go to libitt anyway but
and we'll take a break for a second to talk about determinism because i want you to
want to explain it too but but since you brought up libitt and i and when i was writing my book
unconscious it's obviously i had to address it but you know it never it never seemed to
strike me as a problem because all it indicates is it confirmed my i should say my pre my
predilection in advance which was confirmed by everything i read about consciousness which is
it consciousness is just a surface phenomena so yeah i mean okay so people report that's what
but but everything we know it says you really don't know it's your your perception of what's
going on it's totally different than what's going on in your brain and so okay so that proves it big
deal what does that prove it just proves what you kind of know anyway that people that people sense
of why they're doing what they're doing is um is is uh is is wrong it's the same reason you know
philosophers could come up and say um there's there's a determinism but but but there's no free will
why it's because um reason is the slave of passion as you might have said yeah if you if you really
want that to be the case you can find a reason for it but it's no but but libitt i mean it's
fascinating as far as i know there's still debate about whether that delay was really there although
you pointed out at one point there's some evidence that the prefrontal cortex begins to
experience some some i don't know whether it's an actual potential tens up to 10 seconds before
which i was shocked by which is when they they went from moving from medieval
electroencephalograms on the skull to modern imaging stuff and to go back to tens it's that
point when people start arguing can we tell the difference between intent and an urge are we seeing
urged and it's at that point where you say you know this is sort of interesting and i have like
all sorts of respectable colleagues who have spent a lot of time working on this problem but
it's not where you're going to prove or disprove free will because you got there for the last
three minutes for the end of it okay and we'll get to the fact it's a lot more than the last
three minutes you have to go through hours days years millennia and millions of years but but
let's but let's just it just to clarify our definition so i think you've discussed that a
little bit let's talk about determinism and in the context of what you mean and maybe in
context of applause or or someone else well not not a Laplacian demon
which is the other he always has to come up in the second paragraph also just somewhere a little
bit okay they they check the boxes i held off to three paragraphs before it did so i am a maverick
um determinism i basically define it by exclusion which is you look at why something happened
and as soon as you're informed enough to know that all sorts of things influence stuff that
we're not aware of that could be very distal and time or place that could be subtle that could be
subliminal blah blah blah etc etc it's when you look why something has happened and there's no
contributing factor that requires invoking magic that's the key point they invoking magic we'll get
to that and as i say later i think reminds me of my favorite sydney harris cartoon which i'll remind
you of if you don't know of it let's some point later but um but this okay so that's the term
that's sort of the the question of whether there's magic or whether there's or whether
things are that you know or not really that i agree that's what you really mean by determinism if
there's some if the laws of nature somehow break down somewhere in the middle um and given that the
laws of nature are deterministic and one of the things i i hope to i know whether correct i hope
to change your picture of is is when we get to quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is deterministic
i think you've been led astray there although you know it you know you it's fine that you the
argument is that might not be and you could still show it doesn't make a difference but i i think
it's even it's you don't even have to worry about that well i was in a path of last night saying oh
my god i have the nerve to write two chapters about quantum mechanics and we're talking i'm
talking with you tomorrow so you've just confirmed everything that i knew had to be learning which is
like calling me a dilettante as a compliment oh no no but it's okay i mean it's it's okay because
what i in some sense it was conservative i would i would i'm going to be generous but i would say
where i would disagree with you you go overboard and then show that even if it's overboard it
doesn't make a difference anyway so it's but but i but we'll talk about that um but but but i do want
to get i mean central to all of this just to make it clear and and i you know but my understanding
is from your book and my other things is the same is that we realize that we that most of that are
conscious what we define as consciousness we define as intent what we perceive as all of these things
is is just our awareness is just the tip of an iceberg that that that it's the last stage of
of a of a detailed behavior in the brain that we still don't understand and we understand
contributing factors but that's that this sense of free will like everything else
like even our sense of consciousness is somehow a post-hocollusion i mean we're piecing together
a world in which we have an us and in our brain and a me and and there's some continuity and
and that's that's that's what our brains is doing but it doesn't but it doesn't that's the
that's the end result not the beginning is that are we perfect reasonable to say yeah here okay now
one of the ways to to to to demonstrate this other than just talking about the fact that
reporting is unreliable and by the way it was um i in i know you read the that part of my book on
that and it's the experiments that michael gazanaga on on the split brain thing were for me just so
overwhelming that you that you invent this perfectly rational explanation which is obviously
totally false for why you're doing something but you give lots of examples because you know
what you're talking about i i just sort of read a few and i appeared to know what i'm talking about
but um but one one of the ways you can show that people um that this insensitive free will is an
illusion is is an experiment a psychology experiment that this sense of agency is illusory um is uh
is um is having people push a button when their hands are being controlled by something else you
want to you want to talk about that for something i found that quite interesting yeah that's that's
the one that really pushes lots of people over the edge there there are means these days one one
like standard one is this very cool thing transcranial magnetic stimulation um where you can
stimulate a certain part of the brain and make somebody do something like this is not suddenly
make them become a libertarian when they weren't but this is like you could make their index finger
contract no matter what you try to do and if it's done subtly enough you will believe you
decided to do that i mean i've had that done on me and it's the weirdest thing imaginable or there's
all sorts of ways of manipulating the libit scenario where they add like an extra bell or
something which you were told is driven by your volitional intentional doing whatever um and where
they can manipulate that in ways where you will feel as if you decided to wait a little bit longer
that time before buzzing it there's it's amazing i mean it's wonderful it's wonderful the control you
can have the to just i mean to to explicitly demonstrate these things which one could talk
about vaguely i love that and you really feel like you you're pressed you're choosing to press
that button you've had it done on you it's it's the weirdest thing it's a good thing i didn't
believe in free will beforehand or else i would have stopped believing in free will but you know
we know this there's incredibly smart people who are paid a whole lot of money to make you believe
you really want to buy some nonsense crap that they're advertising you know it shows how much you
want to believe in free will but you can do an experiment like that where you have this sense
of agency and and it's completely uh completely explicitly an illusion because it was created
and yet it doesn't it it's that's not sufficient to convince people and we'll need a lot more as we'll
talk as and you spend a lot of time because you want to talk about you want to try and address all of
the arguments that you've heard over the years i think that you're trying to finally address that
say you know because you've heard all of them but you then you then go to consciousness itself
where you i was really pleased to say that you know obviously i think it's right because it
agrees with me but but um but that what you know consciousness is an epiphenomena i love that
where you point which which by the way gnome chomsky you said to me in a different context
but he said but where you say consciousness is an irrelevant hiccup which i was i i'm going to quote
that over and over it's fantastic um and and um the the key part of this irrelevant hiccup which
is really central and and this is the whole part of of the the question the the hard problem of
consciousness as people might say some people have said is what is what you know some people say the
hard consciousness problem conscious is what is the we that that makes us we but the really
interesting question to me is what what gives us the illusion of a we that's that's the problem i
want to answer but but um but you say something like our brains generate a suggestion and we
then judge it this dualism suggests thinking back century so it's it it enters into even
i guess into into sort of the parlance of at least some of neuroscience and a lot of philosophy
that somehow there's a separation between our brain and the we you want to elaborate on that a
little bit in your perspective of that and it's totally false and just to show sort of the pedigree
that comes with like arguably the most influential compatibilist philosopher on earth right now
talks about exactly that model with a possibility generator an idea generator that comes and then
you pick then the dichotomously pristine made of marshmallow you floating around up there picks
among the possibilities based on your learning experiences and your values and all and like
that's that's where free will slips in yeah and i don't and that and you i think i want to i want
to there's an elephant in the room here and it's dan dan it um and and i do want to i do want to
mention that because it seems to me it demonstrates i know dan and i've been a friend of mine for a
long time but it amazes me how can how someone who is remarkable in his arguments about many things
can be so confused and illogical that somehow um obvious nonsense like that
if if he can be that confused logical it should make you suspicious about the rest of the of the
field yes and just to show where i think that's coming from um like i i tiptoed around him with
kid gloves in so far as i think a lot of his values come through a lot of his philosophizing
in ways that i think tell us about how he's gotten some very wrong conclusions um how can he be so
smart that he concludes that this quote that gives it all away in one of his talks and you
can find the zoo inversions of it on youtube in one of his books saying oh my god i wouldn't
want to live in a world in which no one thought there was free will because they'd just be running
a muck and rapist and violence and besides we wouldn't be able to feel like we earned our prizes
yeah yeah that's why the guy is invested in free will um there's not a whole lot of people who are
saying oh my god if people stop believing in free will i won't be able to feel like i earned my
low socioeconomic status and my abusive parents and my yeah i will come to that i think you mentioned
that very thing at the end and i want to talk about i want to talk about how a way out of that
too maybe it'll help dan but um but um oh good but but you know what is surprising is to hear
dan is you know like me and in many ways well and always a more well-known atheist
but it's so ridiculous to hear that sentence because you could replace free will with religion
and god and he would argue completely the opposite i don't want to live in a world where
there's where people didn't believe in there's god because if they did then they'd be running a muck
and like dan don't you see the complete illogic of that and i i must say i thought would have
blessed me with my endowed chair yeah yeah exactly exactly god wouldn't but but you know but and i
don't want to pick on dan too much although i think he deserves it in this case um uh
is this all of this argument that somehow there's a there's a generator or you're inventing something
that no one's ever seen or measured that somehow allows you around get around the problem that
there's no evidence whatsoever and every logical argument you can think of shows there's no place
for free will it's and uh later on we'll talk about that reminds me of the god of the gaps
argument the more we learn the plate the less place there is for free will to exist it's a
very similar argument when i was reading the book i wrote on god of the gaps at one point later on
in the book um but let me remind you this sydney harris cartoon which you can use in your lectures
if you haven't it's two physicists at a blackboard have you seen that that thing or was a long equation
and then and then in the middle it says and then a miracle occurs and then one of the guys says the
other i think you should be a little more explicit at at that step right there but it's exactly that
right it's it's perfect it's exactly that and and you have to presume magic but what intrigued me i do
want you to elaborate on one thing it's a little almost the last sentence of the of of um of um
oh yeah in of that particular uh section of the book you say um
okay thinking that it's sufficient to really know about the intent in the present
is far worse than just intellectual blindness far worse than believing
that is the very first turtle on the way down that's floating in the air in a world such as
we have it's deeply ethically flawed as well and you just leave that hanging there and maybe
because you can want to talk about later but make why is it ethically flawed um because the subject
about whether there's free will at the end of the day isn't about neuroscience and isn't about
philosophy and isn't it it's about the fact that we've created a world that runs on a myth
that it's just and runs on a myth that it is ethically defendable to have a world in which
all sorts of people are rewarded for things they didn't earn and a vastly larger number of people
live lives of misery and deprivation and are viewed as having been entitled to it for things
they had no control over either okay yeah and we'll get you know sorry
okay good okay um i get worked up about this one yeah well good well i can't wait if you're
worked up about this yeah well that's the part of the book where you can really sense the
emotion and frustration and yet also fear that you're gonna say something that you know
people are gonna anyway it's interesting i'm in the bravery it took to write down
i think you talked about that you were hesitant you know one of the many there are lots of things
that cause you to take time in writing this book but but how people respond to the obvious consequences
of what you're saying is is terrifying a little bit i think i can understand that um you next talk
about where intent comes from where you really begin to get into the into for me the fascinating
aspects of neurobiology much of which i knew nothing about and so it was great learning
experience for me also depressing of course because every time you learn i mean it's driven home
even things that are the examples the explicit examples and empirical examples of things that
i might have presumed exist are are depressing like the fact that that when you make decisions
about things that you think are decisions that you say in three different studies subjects and
brain scanners alternated between rating the beauty of something or the goodness of the same
behavior and basically and you say both types of assessments activated the same region the orbit
orbital frontal cortex or OFC the more beautiful or good the more OFC activation is as if irrelevant
emotions about beauty gum up cerebral contemplation of the scales of justice namely you make decisions
and and it's just explicit not just where we we know that but you can measure the brain and see
that it is that these that these external things which you shouldn't which you don't think are
affecting your rationality are are totally determining what you think is rational yep
and never in a million years with the average person who's just made one of those judgments
saying oh that's interesting why did you decide that oh it's because my orbital frontal cortex
evolved that it has trouble distinguishing between the two because it's very recently
that we evolved making moral assessments rather than just like appearance assessments oh that's
why i did that yeah right exactly yeah and and and it's true we we as you point out that that we
that these moral assessments are recent so yeah all of the biological machinery was developed
without that and we've built up a a morality and a rationally again trying to impose that on on
an infrastructure that wasn't based on any of that once again if if hum had been around today
he would say that reason is a slave of passion it's i mean this gives me to that beautiful quote
i mean which he had presumed presumed i guess in on the basis of thinking about things but
not with the evidence that you have and it's great to see evidence that specifically shows
over and over again that reason is a slave of passion well and you used a great word for
describing all of the clues of like oh it's just this mishmash that you kind of put together
and improvised which is the human brain another sound bite of the field evolution is not an
inventor it's a tinkerer okay what do we got here and we suddenly have like come up with
a notion of love worry okay give me some duct tape this part of the brain is going to have a lid
even though for a hundred million years it's been doing this instead so there's going to be some
mistakes yeah that's exactly it and and okay and then when you so you begin to in each of these
cases for the first when you talk about the the the biological basis of trying to address this
fallacy of free will of perceived free will you you talk about you try and again put meat on
turtles all the way down but saying okay you have this intent what about the minutes before what
about the hours before what about the days before the millennia before the millions of years before
and i and i want to you know unpack that a little bit you talk about you know pre-existing
tendencies towards aggression and and and and and how you say about all because of how much life
has taught them at a young age that the world is a menacing place that people or that animals
in particular that that experience the fact the world's aggressive is a menacing place
respond with the kind of aggression that you might have that's not surprising
that that they don't control that it's based on it's based on their experiences
minutes hours years or lifetimes or genetically beforehand yeah exactly one of the things that
i was interested in i want to throw these things in because there's so many neat examples is um
it just to show a sense that you know when we talk about being good people by me monogamous
versus polygamous you talk about different species and oxytocin and testosterone
and and vasopressin receptor levels and and why don't you talk about what happened i was going
to quote it but you better you can talk about polygamous rodent species versus monogamous
rodent species and and and and and i found this once again fascinating when you think about this
what we impose as a moral issue now is a is a is is biology and biological yeah this is this is
like irresistible and so much fun to teach about voles voles are these little vol things that run
around and there's all these different sub types and there are mountain voles and prairie voles
in the great american west and they turn out despite like having a 99 percent of regimes and
common they have very very different social systems in that prairie voles are monogamous
they form pair bonds and mountain voles are polygamous and i always have to remember when
i'm teaching this okay which one is it garrison keeler garrison keeler talks about the great
like american values out and woe be gone stuff that's in the prairie it's the prairie voles who
are monogamous they turn out not to be but that's that's what i always have to remember before i mess
them up so wow how'd that happen because they're so closely related they're so and incredibly cool
work by like a bunch of neuroscientists over the last couple of decades have completely unpacked
that system when you are a male vol of either species and you're mating you've released this
hormone vasopressant from one party or brain and what it does is it buzzes a party or brain having
to do with reward and whoa they just explain sex feels good and then it turns out that because of
just a gene duplication event a change in a promoter on a gene in other words stuff that like
dead white males and lab coats and molecular biology could explain in the prairie voles
the receptor for vasopressant is more widespread and responsive than the receptor in the mountain
voles so for the same sex act um they get a whole lot more of a buzz and at that point like big
basic behaviorism takes over wow that was great i think i'll stick around and instead mountain voles
are nomadic the males there and they're like gone the next day okay how do you know this how
do you know this one of those experiments where like people's mouths have to drop open brilliant
like molecular manipulation take the prairie vol version of this gene and plunk it down into
mountain voles and you make a monogamous you make a monogamous it's amazing yeah i mean that's the
kind of thing i love i mean you can't argue with that right that's what's great about it and okay so
what about us and what about us and aren't we monogamous but what about divorce rates and what
about most societies are polygamy you know and there's incredibly convincing evolutionary biology
showing that among all the primates we're right in the middle we're like halfway between being a classic
pair bonding monogamous species polygamous one and there's all sorts of interesting ways you can
show that but in terms of this say okay so which version what kind of vol are we and it turns out
we have different variants some of us have one kind some of us have one another and
that's predictive of things like how stable the relationships you form that's predictive of things
like how close you stand to an attractive person if you're already in a relationship oh my god
it's the same stuff it's like the same stuff that before it's over with is produced like
sonnets or divorce lawyers so there's very human specific aspects to it but whoa even that is
ultimately mechanistic yeah it's and and so the and and when we come to responsibility people
who are condemned for one way or another as you point out a lot of these things are gene variants
or affected by expression of genes epigenetics which I want to have you explain the first time I
really understood well I'm not sure I still understand but the first time I think I understood
it was reading your book I never could quite understand how but it's gene expression anyway
but but you you sum this up by saying thus the decisions you supposedly make freely in
moments that test your character like monogamy let's say generosity empathy honesty are influenced
by the levels of these hormones in your bloodstream and the levels of variance of the receptors in
your brain it's just that not character it's those it's that oh all that's like uh fidelity or
if you're in a different society all of the cultural values built around you should be fine
being the third wife or you should want to get as many camels as possible to get as many wives and
that's how we that's the kind of people we are and whether it's one extreme or the other
one of the ones in between it's imbued with value and cultural judgment and that's not it
that said you know it's not all what version of the vasopressin receptor gene you have and those
studies showing that and different human correlates of it's not everyone's just at a higher than
expected rate all all of our usual provisos there but if you knew about the vasopressin status
plus three more of the neurotransmitters and seven of the hormones and this and that
you're getting close to saying that's why this person is this way instead of that way well again
I think if Dan did it again we're saying you know you you can't you may not be able to
feel good about your accompli you know feel you deserve the prizes and you and similarly you
might feeling that you've been a good person is is is great but um but you may also realize
that it's a genetic a bit of luck as well or all the other biology yeah or an historical genetic
historical in fact we'll talk about that I want to so that's so that's that's minutes to hours
you know hormonal uh influence on your actions which are immediate but then you talk about you
know weeks to years really related to neuroplasticity which I guess I I guess uh um um is becoming
increasingly important um and um and you say to jump to sort of depressing in a way to read once
again about adolescence and its importance because we done of us can have control I mean when you
think about that that you're you're doomed you're doomed in some ways to act the way you are because
of the of some of a period in your life that you sometimes want to just forget um and you say
if you're an adult your adolescent experiences of trauma stimulation love failure rejection
happiness despair acne the whole shebang will have played an outsize role in constructing
the frontal cortex because you point out that's when it's being constructed um constructing
the frontal cortex you're working with as you contemplate pushing buttons of course the
enormous varieties of adolescent experiences will help produce enormously varied frontal
cortexes in adulthood boy isn't that depressing yeah but you know from my perspective cool
yeah the energetic mechanism for it well you but you actually but in fact you point out even a
better reason it's not depressing in some sense it was a rhetorical question because I the next
page you say this suggests something remarkable the genetic program of the human brain evolved to
free the frontal cortex from genes as much as possible namely if if the frontal cortex is being
developed during a period of learning of experiences in an irrational intelligent self-conscious
species you'd want that brain function which really is what's governing much of your
rational behavior I guess to to be as free from genes as possible to be based on experience so
you you are you understand the world as it in principle is as opposed to the world that your
genetic ancestors might have experienced yeah like basically we have evolved genetically
more than any other species to be free of our genes and free of their deterministic powers
and that's you that's what that's a great thing it's not a bad thing it's allowed it's allowed us
to get where we are and and and necessary for us for people for as complex a brain as we have
probably well unless you spend your late adolescence where you're listening to speeches every day
by a guy with a mustache and a brown shirt and saying here's who's responsible for problems in
society yeah means formative stuff is happening then and that could be for better or worse
in fact for worse you point out that you talk about this ACE score which is
what's an adverse childhood experience score which i guess psychologists
psychologists can can get by looking at all sorts of neglect and household dysfunction
and abuse and all of these categories that you may or may not have experienced and you say for
every step higher in one's ACE score there's roughly a 35 increase in the likelihood of
adult antisocial behavior including violence poor frontal cortical development cognition
problems with impulse control substance abuse teen pregnancy unsafe sex and other risky behaviors
and increased vulnerable vulnerability to depression and anxiety disorders oh and also
poor health and earlier death so um you know that that that impact is is remarkable and
and one might say how does that impact happen and that's where i may be introducing this too early
but that's this connection between genes and environmental interactions which i think is
related to epigenetics so do you want to explain i mean people would say look how can this be the
genes are genes you have a dna how can how can experience it's almost sounds lamarckian
how can how can experience experience is going to change that chemistry of the of the dna backbone
so what are you telling me what and so why do you why do you get get around that question and
explain it better than i could yeah experience environment all of that doesn't change your genes
your genes that are made up a sequence of dna and a code and it doesn't change your genes what
experience does is change the on off switches for your genes how readily you activated gene
whether you permanently silence it how readily you activated under this circumstance but not that
circumstance what epigenetics is about is the regulation of genes and it turns out when you
look at a species like us the majority of our dna is not devoted to the genes the majority is devoted
to the regulatory elements the instruction manual is much longer than the dna code itself
and what evolution is mostly about if you want to get into a nuts and bolts level
is the evolution of the regulatory control far more than the genes themselves and what
environment does is forever after in some cases in some cases even multi-generationally
make it easier or harder to activate certain genes yeah in fact you say that what it comes
to humans it can be silly to ask what a gene does which is the kind of thing
my elementary biology might have asked because i don't know much but not you shouldn't ask what
that does but what it does in a particular environment because it's a turning it's the
expression it's it's a turning on and off the genes produce proteins that give instructions for
production of proteins and and how when that gets turned on and off and my also understanding of
how impactful those proteins are in subsequent things is also
and environmentally related because some of those proteins are switches that turn genes on or off
yeah sorry you're regulating the regulators and it's regulators all the way down it's these
recursive loops yeah okay i mean and and that's i think incredibly important to realize that that
that's how when one thinks of there there's i guess you know you can say okay the luck there's
lucky genes as people say born with lucky genes but when we talk about the spectrum of behaviors
for which we think we have free wellness spectrum of people and for which we'll have to take
responsibility for good or bad actions you could say well there are two there are two components
there's gene variants the population has gene variants and some people do have lucky genes
and some people have unlucky genes in the sense of getting a variant that you know related to vassals
present or whatever and then there's the other aspect which i really hadn't fully appreciated
is exactly how the environment affects the the mechanism by which environment affects
gene regulation is the other aspect so there's there's the there's the variants in genes
and their variants and environmental experiences and it's that combination of those two
that determines who you are neither of which you had any say in nine of which you had any say in
yeah exactly you didn't even get to fill an application form yeah um and uh um and uh
just like you yeah in particular we all realize we didn't have any say in the choice of our parents
and sometimes that's good and sometimes it's bad i mean and and but it it goes far beyond that um
now you say okay that's okay so that's basic biology but beyond that we go back
more than just years and more just more than just your own life experience but the life
experience of your ancestors culture that which that you'll be it resistible
it's totally cool uh it's totally cool i'm i'm a dilatant in this area because what do i know
from like cultural anthropology or history or stuff but different cultures are different
duh uh and there are historically and biologically and ecologically
logical reasons why different cultures wind up in different ways for example like way back when
traditional means of production you could be a farmer or you could be a hunter-gatherer
or you could be a pastoralist and it turns out that pastoralists all the world over whether it's
yaks or camels or goats or whatever are much higher than likely to generate what is called
a culture of honor where it's built around retribution revenge clan loyalties feuds that go
for centuries where it involves forming warrior classes high rates of aggression all that sort
of thing and whoa you hardly ever see that among the farmers or the hunter-gatherers and what's
that about um if the bad people come and you're a hunter-gatherer they can't steal your rainforest
if they come to your farm they can't steal all your they can't harvest your crops at night
but sneaky low-down varmints can come and rustle your cattle at night pastoralists spend all their
time raiding each other and stealing their means of livestock and like in africa i hang out near a
pastoralist tribe and like they have raids on each other and steal all the cows and people
have to take revenge and all of that among pastoralists you have a special vulnerability
and being nomadic and in your wealth being a bunch of animals that could be stolen
and they all evolve these similar cultures of honor and where if you do not answer an insult
to your honor with twice the retaliation you're just like losing face and you're dishonoring you
and your family and your ancestors and your people and all of that and that turns out to explain
aspects geographical variations and violence on this planet or as another one another one people
whose ancestors or people who live in rainforests are much more likely than chance to invent polytheistic
religions people who live in deserts are more likely to invent monotheistic ones and there's
all sorts of ecological you know if you're living in a forest where there's like a thousand different
edible plants that you can use it's not that surprising that you decide that there's like
a spirit inside each one of those different plants and like a thousand flowers blooming and
like if you're living in the desert everything gets boiled down to just like survival and
very singular things and big surprise they come up with singular religions and you know people
like Jared Diamond have done brilliant work analyzing how it is that this planet was overrun
by the desert monotheists rather than the rainforest polytheists and that's the planet we
have now but that's a cultural difference and that one influences like from shortly after birth
where you were being taught like ethics come from and who you were trying to please and
whose foot or whose plural feet you'll be sitting at if you do things right and wind up in the
in paradise afterward and that's from culture and I never understood that what what I think is
important is is that relates to what we're just talking about in a way that I hadn't really
appreciate before I knew that called obviously culture reflects people and you know when I talk
to people you know they don't seem to get when I talk about religion isn't it surprising that the
children of Christians turn out to be Christian the children of Muslims turn out to be Muslim
and if there's some universal truth isn't that a little surprising of course it's a cultural thing
but now you when you talk about say the pastoralists and sort of retribution and violence
now I kind of now I'm thinking biochemically or neurobiologically so that experience
undoubtedly affects the regulation of genes that produce aggressive responses so you can
understand the how that culture ends up affecting people whose whose DNA is the same but the
regulation of that DNA is culturally determined in some sense and like from a cultural perspective
the job of parents is to make kids who will have the same cultural values as them and translated
that into neurobiology is to have their nervous systems constructed in a way that this is what
they will carry along okay here's here's like one of the all-time cool experiments and it's the only
time I have seen a particular word appear in a scientific journal this was incredible work
by this guy Richard Nesbitt University in Michigan one of the gods of social psychology
and what it was one of those where the psych majors like come volunteer for this experiment
or I got to ask questions about whatever and so they go to the psych department and there's the
lab they're going to down to the end of the hall and they walk down the hall from the elevator
and unbeknownst to them the experiment occurs in the hallway which is it's a narrow hallway all these
like shelves and junk and stuff and as they're walking down there's a guy walking at you he's a
big beefy guy who's working on the project and what he does is as he comes past you
he knocks into your shoulder looks back and says watch it asshole this is the experiment
in print and then what they do is they like you come into the lab and they give you all
sorts of scenarios of like moral quandaries and what would you do in response to this
and what you see is people from the north northern united states having been bumped into
has no effect on their answers and of course there's the controls where the guy doesn't do that to
and people from the south were now far more likely if they were bumped into the knot
to advocate violent responses to these norm violation scenarios and they elevate their
levels of testosterone and stress hormones whoa are you kidding the american south instead of
being settled by these nice like quaker shopkeepers were settled by these like crazy ass irish
schatzman shepherds and stuff and they brought a culture of honor and centuries later you're
walking down a hallway in an hour from michigan and that's going to influence how much stress
hormones you secrete and whether you advocate saying ah you know they're just an idiot but ignore
them versus rip their throat out wow this culture stuff persists wow yeah it's just yeah wow i love
these examples i'm i'm that's i'm really happy with it's amazing because you could put meat on
all of these you know the words sound nice but the meat is what matters i mean that's what makes it
science and uh and we talk about you know i wrote down education here because you talked about the
purpose of parents in some sense is to inculcate those values and the cultural things to their
children which is by the way the reason i argue that for public education the purpose of education
is to get you away from your parents in my opinion which i could never understand why
in the us we have this system where parents somehow are supposed to be able to impact on the
elevate education of children because that's and why i like why i'm not always a big fan of
homeschooling because it seems to me that's the great opportunity is to get people away to learn
that the world isn't exactly necessarily the way their parents say it is yep exactly except you
you know it's not by chance that the school that your parents are going to send you to
um is going to teach some semblance of their exact same values you're not going to go to a
school if you're growing up in Kansas and they teach you that it is time for the workers of the
world to unite and overthrow their chains and you're not going to go to a school and i'm chotka and
they did yeah yes the parents still get in there well okay so so this so this we basically i don't
know whether we beat in a dead horse but we certainly added a lot of color to it um and and
and the part of the book about intent you basically say to summarize in order to prove
this free will we have to show that some behavior just happened out of thin air in the sense of
considering all of these biological precursors the ones we've talked about in a lot more obviously
in the book it may be possible to sidestep that with some subtle philosophical arguments
but you can't with anything known to science and i think that's the sort of
the key thing but then when we come to then then when we come to the padding of the on the back
the question is you know people um you know surely with with grit and hard work you can
overcome you know the the bad luck of your existence and um and the and the idea is that
it is that is a misunderstanding of history which i think you basically say look okay these people
are saying okay there's no free will i accept everything you said about hormones and everything
so clearly there's no free will in what you're doing now but somehow in the past the past you
there was something you could have done that you know to make yourself a better person now
and somehow that that it's okay it's somehow we can bury the free will in the past you want to
elaborate on that or if you're a particularly fancy compatibilist somehow in the future which
somehow counts in the present or whatever it's a notion of like what brought you to this moment
and the answer rather than being because of what happened a second ago and a minute ago
and an hour and a million years ago in biology all the way it's because of the key decisions you
made back when which is just like oh good they've just explained it by saying the puzzle is now
on back when that's that's what we're now trying to explain and the trouble is whatever was in the
past once was now and why did this behavior just happen because of one second before one minute
before etc etc it's it's this it's one of the like dodges in there I mean what you're bringing up also
is this totally seductive dichotomy which is like one compatibilist trick which most people
advocate is that you'll say okay okay there's some stuff we had no control over like I don't have a
voice that could sing opera I'm not tall enough to play in the NBA I don't have whatever receptor
for whatever neurotransmitter so that I've got this amazing analytical skills whatever yeah yeah
yeah we have our natural attributes and those are biological yeah what isn't what really matters
is what do you do with those attributes do you put your shoulder to the grindstone do you squander
your gifts do you do you like get going when the going gets tough to you and that's where we've got
this incredibly sort of Judeo-Christian temptation to say that that is the playground of free will
and judgment it's what we do with what we were gifted or cursed that's the measure of a person
and that's so destructive I mean like it's got a nice namby-pamby liberal version of it
which is when your kid does something good don't tell them oh you must be so smart say oh you
must work so hard because you're fueling that side of the dichotomy and and that's a good thing
because that is instrumental value not because it has moral value but it's this huge dichotomy
that the natural attributes we have are made out of atoms and whether you show backbone
in a moment of temptation that's the stuff that's made out of the fairy dust and the what you do with
what you got what you do with those crossroads and splits in the road and all those things
is made of the same stuff because it's that frontal cortex of yours that decides are you
going to show impulse control or are you going to do long-term planning or are you going to and
it's the exact same how did you get the frontal cortex that you have because of one second ago
and one minute ago and all of that and that's why at some point somebody is going to decide to rob
the liquor store and instead somebody is going to decide to devote their life to doctors without
borders or something exactly the the point that somehow accepting that the instantaneous moment
of what you're you know that your that your local intent to that moment is biological control but
somehow what determined your local intent which was earlier isn't biologically determined it's that
it's that irrationality I had you know you do give a you know to pick again on
dead or as you pick on dead you know but basically he says that he says so you know when someone
when he argued with someone that we have no control over the biology or the environment
thrown at us then his response was so what the point I think you're missing is that our autonomy
is something one grows into it's a process that's initially entirely beyond one's control but
back when it was happening it was the same biology so it wasn't anymore and and and and
as one matures one learns one's being able to control more and more one's activities
but the whole point is you just learned that you don't control I mean you you don't control them
you you know you you control them but your control over that of the of that was determined
because was was once is yeah exactly was was once is it's so clear when one puts it that way I
guess I I I don't I don't see it I think the fundamental question and as a physicist this
is why as a physicist I I guess I never have found this whole issue it seemed to be clear
is it fundamentally everything
everything is determined by a combination of of nature which is biology physics and chemistry
and none of those have fairy dust in them not even physics we'll get to it
and and once you recognize that then then it's clear that that that that free will must be an
illusion because because none of those none of those none the the the physics and chemistry I
know the physics I know the chemistry a little bit in the biology less all of them behave with rules
of science that don't allow for that you know that gap in that Sydney Karris cartoon
yeah exactly and an awful lot of people work very very hard and begin to have
almost evangelical incoherence at points where they still manage to pull that out of the hat
there's still a special essence that doesn't obey those rules well it's it's to me it's very
related again having spent a lot of time thinking recently about consciousness to the same argument
as where is the you that exists beyond your brain I mean it's the same really argument isn't it in
some sense it's a where can that be if you know this is what there is so where's the you if it's
not there and and and if it's beyond there then somehow you're invoking some fairy dust to assume
that that you as an independent existence and the version of that that like makes us wet our
pants the most is so when someone dies there's no them anymore yeah yeah like that's that's enough to
make almost anyone who rejects free will feel a little bit like queasy and dizzy at that point
but yeah yeah well and my you've heard this my argument and people always say what happened to it
and and the argument which I didn't invent myself but first was told to me you know
what was it like before you're born just imagine what it was like before you're born and then
but okay let's talk about them but you are here and and you spend some time on the cognitive
prefrontal cortex which is so important to learning and socialization and sociality
and how those things are are you know evolved and um you talk about the social pfc the the um
that um that basically there's two the prefrontal cortex is sort of control mech I don't know
whether you want to think of it as a control mechanism but it does two things right it it kind of
inhibits it either it either encourages or inhibits and in the right quote unquote right moment
so you want to discuss that a little bit I guess I guess the key thing I learned about from
your is this two parts of the pfc and I love saying these things because they make me sound so
literate biologically now and I forget the words almost immediate that's why I didn't become biologist
early on as I couldn't memorize words I was awful at it but there's the dorsolateral pfc
and then there's the ventromedial pfc and there's sort of the the yin and yang the devil the devil
and the angel on the side of you why don't you talk about that and and by the way I probably
didn't become a physicist because I couldn't understand the concepts so you couldn't you
couldn't memorize the jargon but oh well well whatever yeah it was okay you could have if you
wanted to anyway the lateral let's let's call it the egg heady part of your prefrontal cortex
and the ventromedial you're emotional over the top like hysterical part um ventromedial
prefrontal cortex um is the means by which the more emotional parts of your brain the
olympic system funnel all of their opinions and quirks and yearnings and legitimate aspirations
and stuff and send that information on to the frontal cortex that's how your frontal cortex
is figuring out what your gut is telling you what biases are about to make you make a totally
unfair decision you're it's the ways in which decision making is is influenced by emotion
and that's been a major revolution for the field of figuring out no it's not just your
like gleaming calculator of a prefrontal cortex that's telling the olympic system
now's the time to give the person flowers now's not the time to do whatever because
you're going to regret it that there's as much flow of information from the emotional part of
the brain to this egg heady part of the brain so the ventromedial the emotional part of the
prefrontal cortex is getting that information and amid lots of other areas of the brain there
that fumfer around and confer and compare and contrast and whatever it's ultimately the dorsal
lateral prefrontal cortex that's the decider that sends out a message that is four or five
steps away from your muscles that sends out a message that's four or five steps away from
telling your muscles not to do that raising issues of free won't as well as free will
and these two areas of the brain are like very pertinent to this big surprise the cortex
was the last part of the brain to fully evolve evolutionarily the prefrontal cortex was the
last part of the cortex to evolve the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex was the last part of
the prefrontal cortex to evolve and we proportionately have more of it than any other species out
there so that's where your Calvinistic backbone dwells or your your turpitude or whatever and
it's the same thing what kind of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex do you have today it depends
it depends on what happened the second ago and a million years ago and all of that because stress
and stimulation and certain gene variants and the levels of this hormone and the levels of that
nutrients and certain cultural more produce different kinds of dorsal lateral prefrontal
cortices and this is not just oh this is this has to be the case from work like go do imaging and
look at the size of these in different people and it reflects all sorts of logical stuff people who
were much better at like doing the right thing when it's the harder thing to do you go and look
and they have a bigger and or a more energetic dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex than other people
damage the prefrontal cortex and you get somebody who can even sit there and tell you the difference
between right and wrong and nonetheless at every juncture they're going to do the impulsive disastrous
thing and just to kind of stop you in your tracks depending on the study 25 to 75 percent of the men
in this country on death row have a history of concussive head trauma to that part of the brain
we're talking machines here we're not talking souls yeah well that's right and and and well
that's that's power that's amazingly powerful speaking of the pfc and the experience that you've
had it there was it there's a there was a quote here that made me think well a lot of course made
me think you see all the individual pieces of these findings follow so socioeconomic status
predicts how much a young child's dl pfc which is that whatever it's called
yeah yeah it activates and recruits other brain regions during an executive task
it predicts more responsiveness of the amygdala to physical or social threats a stronger activation
signal carrying this emotional response to the pfc by the vm pfc which is the other
the emotional part of the pfc i guess and such status predicts every possible measure
of function in kids name naturally lower socioeconomic status predicts worse pfc development
this this does smack when a buzzword now is called white privilege which i have which i
which is over well which i have issues with at some level but but we won't go there but
but this does suggest i mean there is privilege and and and and it's and it's undeniable what it
doesn't suggest is that somehow it you know it suggests the world isn't fair but it doesn't say
that you can cure that by then doing something else because it just says you know you're stuck with
with the with the with with your with the experience of your past and suddenly you know
society doing these other things is not necessarily going to solve your particular problems
uh huh here here is where i have to disagree strongly okay good because as it's turning out
very little in your brain is irreversible um that's this whole field of neuroplasticity yes
and when you look at how change occurs an incredibly dramatic change and explanations
for why one out of every ten or a hundred thousand of kids who grow up in some appalling
circumstance wind up not having that profile and blah blah all of that um change happens massive
amounts of change can happen and when you look at how that works it's exactly as mechanistic as
everything else that reinforces the belief that we don't have free will rather than doing exactly
the opposite no in fact i yeah we're not in agreement because i guess what i wanted to
say is that appropriately in fact that's my out at the last part of this book i'm going to argue
that that appropriately treating the world as if we have free will understanding that we don't
have free will will allow the kind of positive change that one that is that that is necessary even
personal positive change right we'll get there the possibility of change and how you do it
can only be effectively done when you understand the mechanisms that imply we don't have free will
if you want to understand how how to affect you you know we talk about we don't have the ability
to determine what we wish in some ways but we can but with that knowledge we can we can i think
allow future development that may change what we wish so we'll we'll get there and i think that's
really important but but i guess what i was saying is that some of the societal solutions that are
proposed there's inequities and they're built in inequities in the world and that's and you're
right we should be trying to address those in a realistic way and and a realistic way means
thinking about the science and not and not thinking about airy fairy wonderful imaginary
solutions i guess that's that's that's my let alone nationalistic myths of equal opportunity
yeah exactly you got it anyway so that so i think that the the i love your summary
part of basically the takeaway is that it's impossible to successfully exactly this is what i
was gonna i was good for this quote was right in front of me it's impossible to successfully wish
what you're going to wish for this chapter's punchline is that it's impossible to successfully
will yourself to have more willpower and that it it isn't a great idea to run the world on the
belief that people can and should i and that's important but i want to come back to that because
i think that does leave this will this loophole that while you can't successfully will yourself
to have more willpower what you can do is potentially with that knowledge and the
recognition that people can learn and change you can imagine ways to in the future
adjust yourself to to to to have characteristics that you might prefer to have and exactly that's
really important but you can only do it if you realize the real science behind it which is that
it's not you don't do it by just strength of character you do it by thinking of the kind of
things that change people for better or worse and and and so i think that's really important
and if in addition to that you're lucky enough to wind up in life where you can listen to a
lecture yeah exactly that's the whole point i mean learning actually works otherwise you and if we
didn't think that i don't think you and i would have been doing what we well we might have anyway
but uh but um but we you know it's that a hawk experience in fact somewhere in the book you
say how devastating is to find something you fundamentally believe in is wrong and i've always
said i found it the most energizing thing in the world i hope everyone my my goal in higher
education is that every student has something that they fundamentally believe is central to their being
proved to be wrong and that's the purpose of education i think because it opens your mind
well i think as i said before you're made of more resilient stuff than me so good going maybe yeah
well yeah what maybe in that aspect but i'm i'm still i still feel i still envy all the other
aspects of you anyway um and and i find them remarkable in ways i always find when people
do things that i couldn't think of even doing in principle how and and you're full of that but
anyway let's and we've already okay enough of that okay i want to get to chaos and determinism
and then i want to get to the to the to sort of the the emotional heart of this which is
which is responsibility in the second half of your book but so you the argument look it comes
down to this okay people say yeah yeah all that's true but nature has these weird characteristics
and one is chaos that the world is chaotic and and unpredictable and um um and and that's there's
the out there's the magic there's the magic out because the world is unpredictable either because
when you never have more than two bodies and as you describe nicely here um uh you have you have
chaotic systems you can't you can't you can't predict the future of a three-body system which
is amazing when you think about it it just the first time i learned that was amazing and i will
give a plug by the way i um um uh timothy palmer i wrote a book called um something something
something of doubt which i just actually we had a he's a physicist he's a climatologist it's a
great book on chaos and and and and understanding its implications for not just not just climate
science but behavior and all sorts of other things i highly recommend you take a look at it
i don't know if you saw it but in some recent issue of science or nature there was a paper
entitled something like a statistical solution to the three-body problem which of course i
immediately turned the page because i was not going to understand a word of it i assume it really has
not solved the three-body problem statistically well yeah i mean but i mean a statistical solution
is chaos especially if they're if they're if they're you know strange attractor you can ask
what's the likelihood of the system is going to end which is what meteorology is all about what's
the likelihood that and and you do that by running computer simulations many times over and you see
where it goes because you can't a priori do it you change the initial conditions and anyway um but
chaos implies and you you go into this that that that that for many systems small changes extremely
small changes in initial conditions can cause dramatic changes in outcomes can don't don't
always not don't must but can and that's an important thing too they don't always but they can
and that seems to be suggested somehow there's this there's this out and um and and i think
i don't know what you say here but basically i paraphrase this thing not being able to so
you this is an anti-reductionist argument and and as as a as a reductionist it's always amusing
to me to see the anti-reductionism as someone who's tried to understand the fundamental structure
of matter it's always amusing um because although all year later um emergent complexity i think is
reductionism in a different form but but um not being able to trace things to their fundamental
constituents not being able to go back to the fundamental constituents to be able to say
how a system is going to behave is not an out you want and let me let you give your explanation
and then i want to add something to it from physics oh good um because every single person who says
chaoticism is totally cool and unexpected and revolutionary is completely right and every one
of them who then says and this is where you could find free will is wrong because they always make
the same mistake they think that systems that are unpredictable are undeterministic and that's the
get out of free get out of jail free card that they think they're pulling out at that point
and there's a universe of differences between determinism and predictability chaotic systems
which occur in like molecules and cells and brains and societies and universes chaotic systems
are deterministic or is that deterministic is the most like old-time clock with gears
but because of the nature of the interactions going on are not predictable and unpredictable
does not mean you can pull free will out of that that's the key point you make and i think very
important is that unpredictable is not not deterministic the three-body system is governed
by newton's laws there's nothing more predictable than that they're the same things that made the
world ended the burning of witches when made it seem like the world was comprehensible by
mathematics and causes had effects and effects had causes yeah but they're unpredictable but let
me add for for your ammunition as i was thinking about this it occurred to me the exact this almost
the strongest version i can think of this is thermodynamics because there i can't predict
there's no way i can predict where the atoms in this room are or what that you know for many
reasons there's no way but there's nothing stronger than the second law of thermodynamics
okay which says even it's all totally unpredictable but it's but it governs the world
there's a law that you can't break and every time people try and do it they create
perpetual motion machines because they try and avoid the second law of thermodynamics
and much of life is trying to avoid it when i look at my study every day it's trying to avoid it
and and yet there's nothing more there's nothing stronger that got nothing more deterministic
than the second law of thermodynamics yet it's based on the fact that i it's based on the fact that
i'm i have a system that's at a fundamental large-scale level unpredictable
never going to be able to say exactly where it's going to be puffing out but by definition
if you've just climbed up a mountain the bag of potato chips you brought with you were going to be
like bulging outward yeah yeah exactly and it's uh it's incredibly important that that that that um
that uh that we that it's it's the basis of the world we live in we physics works for a world
that's chaotic and unpredictable because because it is deterministic because there are certain
things you can say with certainty and the one of them is that a closed system in a closed system
the entropy of that system is going to either remain the same or increase uh and and and and so
and that's deterministic that's a rule that's a law and a law that can't be violated in spite
of the unpredictability of the specifics of that system and and that's why i guess where i come from
in physics so okay for the first time in my life i'm going to start using the word thermodynamics
great that's exactly oh good yeah exactly now and you can and it's just like i'm going to say
i'm going to remember that dorsal lateral or whatever pfc make myself sound good too okay um
want to well come to i want i want to jump ahead because you point out that we have developed okay
so that in 1922 um people would have said that you know someone who began shoplifting
you know and urinating in public behaved a certain way because he chose to in 2022 we now
say they behave that way because of deterministic mutations of one gene in in this particular
example and you point out that that um so in in if if that i forget what you say but if
if free will is determined by what we know by level of ignorance there's something wrong if
an instance of free will exists on only until there's a decrease in our ignorance so it's free
will until we understand it and then it's not free will anymore and and as i say that's exactly
the god of the gaps argument exactly you know thunderstorms are god and then we understand
thunderstorms and where's the room left for god you it's it's not even theologians understand
it's not a good argument for trying to put god there because that shrinks and i don't understand
why the free will people don't realize that shrinks each time we learn more about how systems work
um yes emergent complexity is interesting because um the argument and and and and and
i've you know i've seen in in physics there's this debate because these people say oh well you
know particle physics these fundamentalize okay but really the really interesting stuff is the
stuff that you can't explain at this reductionistic level it's all the fascinating structures is how
meal boils it's it's it's uh and and and that and you know and and there are things you you know
obviously the understanding things at a microscopic level don't necessarily help you understand and
there's lots of and you give examples of emergent complexity in particular in neuronal systems um
and um but it's again it's not clear why that that um
that reflects anything the fact that you can't trace the end result from fundamental constituents
is once again uh ignoring the fact that that that unpredictability is not the same as in
as indeterminacy and um and evolution itself in some sense it seems to me when i when i was
reading it some thoughts occurred and i wanted to run them by you i mean you know it's no great
mystery i mean snowflakes are in some sense emergent complexity you take the fundamental
polar interactions molecules and who would have thought they'd form these beautiful
Christmas-like patterns but but more than that um uh evolution itself in some sense is a because
you point out that the whole point of of of emergent complexity is that the individual
constituents are just doing their own little thing without knowing what the whole system is doing
and somehow the whole system goes in a certain direction and that's a remarkable statement
but okay so what um and you know but i don't you i wanted to ask you don't you see i mean
i see evolution is exactly that biological systems evolve not because there's some
they're heading in some direction or because globally something's happening it's because
the individual system sort of might be a genetic mutation and near neighbor-nearest neighbor interactions
reproduction and other things are going to drive the system in a way that may you know in
response to natural selection will will create an organism that has beautifully structured
existence to make it look like they were designed exactly and that's totally cool and amazing and
emergent complexity makes me so happy i can't even begin to tell you that and it's the greatest
all of that but this is not a playground either where suddenly you can pull free will out of it
because once again is built around the confusion of predictability and determinism and the people
who try to sidestep it and still somehow get free will out of it always do the same trick
that their model requires once you've established an emergent level of something unexpected
that emergent level can reach down and change the constituent parts and if and only if there's
10 000 ants and they have formed like a complex society like each individual ant now can like
solve the traveling salesman problem on a piece of paper no the whole point of emergent complexity
is that the stupid simple little building blocks are still just as stupid and simple
but because there's enough of them out of it has come something amazing and complex and adaptive
but in order to pretend you've pulled free will out of it you've got to assume the system works
in a way that it can't that it doesn't exactly okay and now let me throw something out at you
which i only realized in the context of reading that description of yours
which i'm going to use now whenever i hear people throw emergent complexity at me
that emergent complexity is an extreme form of reductionism because emergent complexity is just
saying right right reductionism is saying the world the complicated world is based on simple
principles a few quarks four forces put them together and look what happens emergent complexity
is saying exactly the same thing the fundamental constituents aren't knowledgeable about the whole
world they're not complex they're very simple they have a few simple behaviors a few simple
properties that are restricted to and out of that simplicity comes this amazing complexity
so it's the ultimate force it's the ultimate form of reductionism it seems to me exactly and the only
reason and it's reductionism which when you put enough pieces together becomes unpredictable but
you haven't like escaped from the laws of reductionism and the only reason why emergent complexity
is interesting separate of uh because sometimes it's really surprising and beautiful is that's
understanding some phenomena it makes more sense to try to get it at that level than at the more
reductive level it's just more convenient yeah exactly and but physics is also based on that
most people i've written about in one of my books most people don't realize physics does
exactly that the law there's no the laws of physics are not there's no law of physics is universal
so you you discuss the laws that are appropriate to the scale at which you're exploring phenomena
and that's a that was a revolution in our thinking about physics and we actually have
the mathematical underpinning of that something called the neuronal normalization group it doesn't
matter but that that that it's appropriate if if you're you know if you're a if you're a
psychologist if you're a behavior psychologist or neuroscience it's ridiculous to try thinking about
quark interactions it's not going to get anywhere and so and but the same is true in physics it's
not a new phenomena that that you talk about the the appropriate interactions at the scale at which
you're looking at and that's just another you know and you do that because you eventually want to
finish your thesis and get a degree exactly it's like the most accessible level yeah you want to
yeah you want to do you want to exactly you want to get results and then that's what science is all
about find a way to get results that work and that and that you can test and nothing more fundamental
than that um but you point out I mean this this thing you just said that some level you have to
reach down in order to find that miracle in order to find that way yet the the emergent complex
system is to reach down and change the properties of the fundamental constituents but neurons are
still neurons independent of what whatever and the mechanisms neurons are going to change no
matter how complex the system there's in their fundamental interactions are going to be the same
and I I can't help but say this there's a whole chapter based on this and it seems to me you
must be doing it because that's where all the philosophers are hanging their hats without
saying it somehow they're all saying just that without having without explicitly saying it because
when you explicitly say it it sounds ridiculous and and I can't help but think you must have
for much of your life had to counter those philosophers or or at least hear those philosophical
arguments um that's really seductive um and that's what it pivots around and like I I stole this
metaphor from someone who an emergent feature of water molecules is water molecules are not wet
until there's a whole lot of them that's an immersion property however water is made of two
hydrants and one oxygen it's not the case that once things get wet it's sustained because it's
now two oxygens and one hydrogen yeah that's great that's great okay we will now move to
quantum mechanics but you'll be happy to know we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna gloss over it
for many reasons because I think it's a red herring in the first place um and you point out how it's
a red herring for for biological reasons which I'm aware of and I had a big debate once on stage
with Mr. Hamarov about this but um yeah but yeah I know it's where I explained another
slightest understanding what quantum mechanics was all about but um but the idea is people say look
quantum mechanics is indeterminate because it it has a fundamental indeterminacy that you
perform an experiment and the results are probabilistic you can't say with certainty
in some cases you can but in many cases you can't say with certainty
what the result you can only say probabilistically what the result of an experimental be
and suddenly that fundamental indeterminacy appears to give you a way out um let's give
your arguments for why that's irrelevant which is basically two I think I want to summarize them
one that um that randomness is not a is not a good explanation of free will
and two that when you actually think of the mechanics of the brain the scale at which
quantum mechanical effects might come about which is something I've recognized too but
that the scale at which they might be relevant is vastly different than the scale it's going to be
cause an activation potential to or a whole slew of things to happen to make a decision
they're vastly different scales so why don't you elaborate for a second and then I'll say
explain why I don't think any of that matters anyway um because I had never heard this phrase
before before starting to read about this stuff the brain is a moist noisy environment
which was very picturesque to me and kind of like unsettling and a little bit yucky
but I guess like for stuff at the quantum level to have any hope and hope in this case
comes with like 23 zeros after it any hope of being able to impact macro events it requires a
synchrony it requires all of these random events to be random in roughly the same way all at once
and it can't work that way statistically and it especially can't work that way in moist noisy
environments like biological stuff because what they're very good at is collapsing
sort of the indeterministic features yeah the collapse of way for yeah I mean that's the
arguments that are presented that those words are are problematic but the but the idea is exactly that
that you know I face it because people talk to me well well look at all this quantum entanglement
and quantum teleportation when we will be able to send people from here there I would book a
Star Trek as you know and and um and um and the point is the only reason we can do that is we
have to it is quantum mechanics is so weird it because we don't experience it we don't experience
it because uh we don't we're not quantum we're we're we're classical beings and we're
exist at a level where the quantum mechanical aspect of reality is hidden it's an amazing
thing that we humans even discovered that it's there that that in order to illustrate these
quantum mechanical things you have to very carefully prepare systems and unbelievably
carefully prepare systems that's why Nobel prizes are given out for these things it's hard to do
so that you get so that you can isolate the weirdness of quantum mechanics otherwise it's not
there if it was quantum mechanics wouldn't seem so strange but it it's it's it's not there because
you know you can't teleport a human because a human isn't a very carefully prepared
state of two photons where you work very hard and you ins isolate it from the environment
all the time it's happening so they're no further interactions which destroy
quantum correlations and all of the rest and i mean it is surprising that there are in biological
systems places where quantum coherence exists where you wouldn't have expected it to you know maybe
in photosynthesis for example but but that's different than than brain function which is
incredibly noisy environment and not just noisy but the scale over which quantum fluctuations
even if they can happen could happen is vastly different than the scale where the important
things related to neuronal processes and activation potentials and decisions and are made okay so
that's i think that's really important but the but the but the thing i want to stress to you
is quantum mechanics isn't indeterminate so that whole argument is wrong in the first place
people get it wrong quantum mechanics is is determined quantum mechanics is based on a
second-order differential equation schrodinger equation second order different equation says
if you give me the initial and it's a second-order differential equation for the wave function
not for an observable but it says you define it here and for all just like newton just like the
three-body problem for all future times i can calculate exactly with a hundred percent certainty
what the wave function is going to do at least in principle in practice i might not be able to
it's an incredibly it's completely deterministic now it is true that when you try and make measurements
those are probabilistic but the underlying mechanism of quantum mechanics is completely
deterministic and so the fact that the results results are probabilistic is is just a red herring
and the example i would give you i think which i think is you know so people say oh maybe there's
some accidental activation here that changes your view here and that that gives you an out
because of quantum mechanics the the example that i think is really important is is radio
activity radio activity happens because of quantum mechanics so i can't tell you when a given uranium
atom is going to decay but i can tell you with exact certainty that the laws of nature is determined
that when what the behavior of the radioactive system is going to be and how many of the i
can't tell you which one but i can tell you with certainty you know if it's big enough system
exactly how many and they're going to be decaying at any instant and so while it appears as if you
have that indeterminacy it's it's really it's really a red herring the system is as determined
as in in large scale as anything else and radio activity is a is a perfect example if a radio
act if uranium atoms you put a bunch of them together are going to have a well-known decay
rate the same is going to be true for for neurons in your brain or anything else it's
going to they're just as prescribed so i would if if you had told me that i would not have had to
effect my way through writing two chapters on it no but on the other hand it's good the fact
you were forced to do it is useful because then you were able to discuss the things you know
which is the processes in the brain and illustrate those which i can't do illustrate exactly how how
implausible even if it were true how the the processes that determine free will in your brain
aren't going to be affected by quantum mechanics and um and um anyway well
we're now going to talk we're going to now spend the last half hour so talking about the last half
of your book it's really not the last half it's so i feel better it's like the last third um
and which i which i which gave me solace when i realized how much i had left to read when i when
i before i got to the end um uh the the um the the you know question of what we do about this but
but part so so given that given that it's undeniable that the that the world that we don't have free
will based on science so there's no loopholes there's no places for the magic to occur um
um
why do we have the illusion of free will and why is that a good thing you ask about at the very
beginning of this and and and it seems to me you know all right you have mentioned too it's
there's an obvious reasons right because because it allows us to function it effectively the
illusion of free will allows us to go about whether we're early hominids or not um to go about
living the life creating the illusions that allow us to live our daily lives and evolution
therefore picks us we don't have the choice we don't have the choice to not believe in free will
if we want to be
psychiatrically resilient um one of my favorite definitions of clinical depression is
it's a pathological failure of the ability to rationalize a way reality that's great oh i like
that yeah absolutely and it and and and here's the point when i say we have no choice we have a
well we don't have a choice but we can be we can learn intellectually we can learn every time i'm
going to say i have a choice i'm going to say we can learn if we have exposed to the right teachers
of the right time in the right place um we can learn intellectually that free will doesn't exist
you and i can learn that but that does not mean that we emotionally since reason is a slave of
passion that in our daily lives we don't go about our daily lives every day but because we're we're
you know we function funk well enough to be integrated in society that we don't go around
behaving like everyone else like we are making choices and we're and and we're doing that so it
so it's so but it's the same as saying you know the fact that evolution requires us in some sense to
believe in free will is the same as saying well evolution may you know in principle suggest you
know it's okay to you know kill your neighbor under certain conditions but we do have learning
that allows us to override at least intellectually override that that fundamental evolutionary
um remnant so so so so i think the second half of your book in large sense is about how we
understand override and utilize it to make a world which isn't bad it may seem like it's bad
and and and and um um and and uh so um if i go to
um so you you know you summarize basically saying yeah well i don't think we need to summarize
anymore biological turtles all the way down but what do we do with that and the first question is
you know will we run amok because the first thing you can think of it's the same as the question
people have with asias if we don't have free will then why then why care then why should we try and be
good why should we why why should we you know let's just do what we do with me you know i'm
not responsible for what i do so who cares and i think just like for atheism i mean you could have
that attitude but i think the thing you point out is that that even that that's not a natural
consequence of accepting the the the absence of free will any more than accepting that there's
not a god if you look at the statistics and you look at the data is not does not promise naturally
you behave it quote unquote immorally that that um that when you actually look at the data people who
who who who don't believe in in in in a god uh generally um don't behave any more immorally
than and often sometimes more ethically than people who do i want to let you elaborate on that
which is uh thank god because that solves the running amok problem the literature there's been
like a handful of studies about the ethical implications of making people believe more or
less in free will but there's a massive literature on the relationship between ethical behavior and
belief in deities and stuff and it's exactly what you show um in part because a lot of the time
religious people are telling you about how ethical they're being and a lot of the time you're
measuring things as being ethical which don't really matter to atheists um and all sorts of
other confounds in there but the most interesting thing about that literature is exactly paralleled
in the free will one you know prime someone to believe less in free will for the next 10 minutes
and they cheat more on a on an economic game and and even though it's not clear if that really
does happen all the time but get someone who hasn't believed in free will for a long long time
and there is exactly as ethical as someone who really believes in the very heart and the
religion equivalent is one that like i don't know why i get some sort of almost transcendent
something out of um when you look at people who have thought long and hard about where does goodness
come from and what sort of person i want to be and what does this all mean and why are we here and
if they've thought long and hard about it it almost doesn't matter if their conclusion is
and there's no free will or there's no god or if their conclusion is there's a god with all these
attributes um on the average they're going to be more ethical than other people because they've
thought long and hard and it's the doing that that's almost certainly the guarantee because you care
about what counts as the right way to live your life enough to have thought long and hard about it
and enough to have had a moment of crisis and enough to have felt lonely because there's no god
or enough to yeah it's because that stuff matters to you enough to have thought about it and to have
thought about how you feel about it and that's what it's about we're not going to run amuck
if we train kids and people with as much value laden ideas about why are you the way you are and
why did this person become the way they became as we invest in theological or agent of arguments
about it um it would be we're not going to run amuck you know and here's a psychological experiment
i've done um because i you know with the atheist thing not the free will thing with you know you
give a you give the standard you know somewhere the standard dialogue you know how we trust you
atheists be moral if you don't think god holds and if you you know um and and what when i hear that
i always ask the question and i've done this to an audience that only wants to
did someone come up why say okay if you didn't believe in god would you go and kill your neighbor
right now and and and and you know and generally except for one exception where someone put his
head said yes um you know people say no because they have reason they have thought they you know
they and and that's and by the way that's steve pinker's argument for why god is redundant because
you know if god's if god said rape and murder was of innocent people was okay would it be okay
and and and and and most people say no and then you say well then steve pinker would say
well just get rid of the middleman you don't need the god to say it but i think the point is if you
ask people okay just imagine you believe god would you then you know steal from your neighbor
you know beat your kids uh and people you know and and when i think about they realize that it's not
even if they think it's their belief in god even if that's what they're telling them
fundamentally if they have reason they're they're they think of all the reasons why they
shouldn't be doing the bad behavior anyway and it's it's superfluous and i think the same
you know is true for free will ultimately the if you think of reason and rationality you're gonna
the behavior is going to be the same regardless of whether you believe in free will or not so
that's my little psychological memory you try it in your class sometimes to see if if anyone would
but sounds good to me yeah you know but you give the example of course of scandinavia everyone's
perfect example of idyllic society it's having problems now but but um but you know that there's
you know a secular society where people on the whole are you know better behaved and and more
and more generous blah blah blah we won't go into it you give a lot of examples
i would argue that part of the reason is the same reason i'm invigorated by the fact of
lack of meaning in the universe is that if you focus on the here and now if the here and now is
all there is then you pay much more attention to the here and now and and and and if you pay much
more attention to the here and now and you're rational you're going to begin to behave in on
the whole and in a in a in the kind of the kind of you might say ethically good behavior that
happens naturally so so getting rid of the fear of the hereafter and and instead of thinking of
now as the all that is is is is actually a positive motivator to behave well not a negative one
exactly yep now
and you do point out the religion your religion generally tends to have people treat people
better but only in their in group and the world is an example of that but again i would argue that
that's not so much a problem of religion we ran once uh in my institute i ran a workshop in the
origins of xenophobia but surely i mean that's again something over which we don't have control
right even at the biological level the immune system is the is the very basis of xenophobia
right as as beautiful way of stating it yeah i mean you know and and if it works for single
failed animals and immune system and you know it's it's a natural thing we have to overcome it
it as rational beings just as we have to ultimately overcome our illusion of free will
it's the same thing and so yeah i don't blame religion for that i blame evolution but but here's
where um i see hope in where it's sometimes in where you see um despair maybe i don't know
whether it's really that strong you have a great section on how we learn i mean it's beautiful i never
knew i knew about eric handel but i never i never i never knew these beautiful diagrams and it's just
a lovely way of learning about the neurobiology of how learning happens it's just beautiful just
spectacular and then you find out like this is occurring in sea slugs it's the same molecules
in us it's unbelievable that same molecules in sea slugs and us which is why learning about how
change occurs not only shows you that that's not incompatible with dropping free will it it's proves
it you can see the building blocks you can you can see the building blocks are black same
and you can see how learning exactly you can see that it's not there's some again it's not a mystery
i mean it's at some level it is but i mean at the fundamental basic level you can see how naturally
it's possible for a system and not only that you can see how that neurobiology of learning is
affected by stress and conditioning because you can see when these you know how these neurotransmitters
are going to be whether they're going to be expressed or how well the system is going to
receive them and respond to them are based on environment and so you can see exactly how how
environment and and past experience will affect learning as well but you see that's where
the fact that change happens is for me the great hope because i guess i see
i've often said and now i don't know whether you know and i guess i'd say i call this better
living through chemistry um but which is really what's happening is it's thinking about how the
world really works can give us more effective ways of producing a better world than living under
the illusion that it works other ways and um and so let me give you my thinking on this and i want
to see what you think what you think about this that i've as i was about to say before i've often
said and i don't know if i'll say anymore that we live in a world in which there's no free will
but for all intents and purposes it's a world that it is identical it looks identical on the
surface to a world in which there is free will so it and what i said following that and now i'm
going to change what i say i think i said and therefore it makes sense to behave as if we have
free will now in some sense i i i think that's still true but now i would amend that i would say
it's it's it's indistinguishable on the surface from a world in which there is free will but but
we should behave in a way that understanding that that that's a that's that's an illusion
but reproducing it in a positive way by realizing that there isn't free will namely we can we may not
have choice to now of what we wish to do and this is what i was saying earlier but by learning we
can change and therefore if we realize we don't have free will we can say how can i be a better
person well let me think of the of the neurobiological influences that i can have today tomorrow the
next day so that the day afterwards when i think of the antecedents that cause me to behave a certain
way those new antecedents will be will allow me to act better than it was now because and so i see
recognizing change and only understanding that there's no free will is a way to actually do
do what you think you're doing by free will namely be becoming a better person
cool and there goes denit down the drain among other things that's that's beautiful right amid
that is our grounds for hope and that is our grounds for like neural plasticity things can
change things can change in awful direction someone who was open minded and tolerant back when
is now a bitter old whatever but it can go in opposite directions as well and understanding
not how to change yourself but understanding the circumstances in which you will be changed
and a beneficial way is a very good thing and it's the effective way of doing it it's if you
can only do it effectively if you understand how it happens and if you have this illusion that you
have a choice then you'll probably never be able to effectively change eat while you might be able
to but but it's an accident and and and and it's i think it's not just true and and you've illustrated
between say 1922 and 2022 it's not just the case an individual level it's a case in a societal level
by learnings and you know you and I are devoted I think to learning it's it's an education we can
that is a way to affect our understanding and our behavior in a way that makes not just us better
individuals but society is a whole better so we don't draw on quarter people we don't have public
hangings even though we wreck but we can only do that once again and you you have an amazing
amazing chapter on which is scary on retribution and and punishment to show that we love it
and and but once again knowing that we love it is the same things knowing that we don't believe
if you will that's okay knowing it gives you the opportunity to overcome that it's overcome that
which's hardwired in one way and to know how to change your environment in a way so that you don't
you don't enjoy punishment as much yeah it lets you figure out like the joy of retribution
okay how much does it weigh what does it smell like does it do more of this or that in this
circumstance here's how we could turn brutally violent people into people who will be like
really aggressive sons of bitches when they play chess yeah yeah when they play chess exactly
and you talk and and you talk about it's really hard you talk about Scandinavia but you know people
want to punish people who've done really bad things but of course and and this is this is
where I would also sort of differ and at least semantically describing things
I think you would say people don't have responsibility for their actions in a fundamental
sense and I would say we should treat them as if they have responsibility but that doesn't involve
punishment okay if I run someone over I ran them over there's no denying that fact I'm responsible
for the fact that they got run over now I may not have had control over that but then the response
to that is saying okay you're responsible what can we do to ensure that that doesn't happen again
that should be the the response not I'm going to slap you in the head but you are respond I would
say you are responsible but the but if we understand where it comes from the the the response to that
responsibility is a very different one it's to say how can we ensure sure if you have schizophrenia
we have to probably ensure that you're not in a position to hurt other people not punishment
and if there's a treatment we have responsibility to treat um you're you're just
you're dichotomizing between what you're calling responsibility and control yeah I would use a
dichotomy between mechanistic responsibility and moral responsibility but it's the exact same thing
as what you just said yeah yeah and and and well and but you talk about it you know and I think
you're arguing about quarantine is a lovely one you talk about the origin of the word and you really
in some you're really quarantining people just as you'd quarantine people who have no other kind
of sickness in a way that protects others around them but not as punishment you know you're not
keeping a kid at home from school less punishment if they have a cold you're doing it you know for
other reasons and um and that and this quarantine which can be and as you say what is punishment
punishment which is a lovely word in Scandinavia where you think that you know taking people have
done horrific things like you give the example this well-known serial killer the guy who killed
all those people on that island in in in Sweden um with Sweden or Norway I can't remember anyway
it's one of those scorned countries yeah Norway I think um and what they put him in jail and put
him in a in an environment where he is you know a nice environment to live in and and their attitude
is you know um let's see if we can make sure he you know whatever conditions cause me to do that again
cause me to do that won't happen again which is very rationaling to say although most of us
you know many people intrinsically emotionally want to say kill the bastard draw on quarter the
bastard do this you know and um and what the Scandinavian culture has produced as the response to
the horror of him is that instead of a visceral desire to make him hurt what all those interviews
of parents of etc showed was a visceral desire to be able to say yeah we never have to think
about this guy again his grandiosity yeah clown he's a violent clown but good he's a way we never
have to think about him again that's what their culture has been able to detour
the viscera of grief and if we think about it logically I think we can say we can direct our
culture in that direction I mean even we don't have the so yeah we naturally might our our
inclinations and our experience might not make us want to do that now but understanding how
James happens the very thing that you some sense say is depressing to me offers great hope in fact
the only hope I think ultimately to get better is to understand how the world really works
if you don't understand how the world really works it's an accident if if you improve it
it's a complete accident and and I guess I would I would say I'm giving you words that may be useful
but I when I read your stuff I thought it this almost sounds like a the kind of thing some
self-help artists would say but I think it's true the the change we want doesn't come from within
it comes from without the change we want is going to come from without it's going to put
ourselves in circumstances which can cause a change it's not going to come from willpower we
don't have because we didn't have it in the first place now become the sort of person who is able
to put themselves in a different circumstance yeah the last two things and I want to go another two
or three minutes you've been great maybe five minutes I want to come back to Dan then it's about
not during during praise for accomplishments which you mentioned which I thought was it is hysterical
and so as if that's what it's all about then what are we talking about for but but more than that
actually I again I'm going to present myself as a devil's advocate I don't think we disagree
but I would say that accomplishments
we don't deserve praise for the accomplishments it's the same we go back to the ancient romans
you know who separated the artists from the art um which I you know I first learned that I used to
like ancient history and I was amazed it seemed so foreign to me but it's again so obvious I thought
well okay so this is the artist's big deal they would say god you know he's god is speaking to
them but that doesn't make this person particularly good but what we can do is we can say accomplishments
can be recognized as amazing and you can be recognized as amazing if you're brilliant or you
it's not something that intrinsically means you're good or we have to have them back for
but we can say yeah let's recognize you're an amazing person it's nothing wrong with that
you've achieved something amazing let's all celebrate that so I guess I can instrumental
was that only if it's instrumental only if it inspires other people yeah that person more likely
to do it again that's as good of a tool as anything sure yeah but I mean the fact that you had no
choice in some level in being the person you are doesn't make your accomplishments less amazing
doesn't make Einstein less amazing doesn't make you less amazing to me you're still amazing to me
even if I know you didn't have choice Robert you really are but yeah so I think I think recognize
that so you I think you know even someone like Dan Denneken at least you know say okay well the
book you've written one you know or the or the arguments you've given are amazing arguments and
they've convinced me of this or that and yeah we'll give a prize for the amazing arguments you're the
person who happens to receive it big deal but the arguments are the you know it's and it's like what
you know in some sense it's what I've won prizes you've won prizes but I try to have the attitude
of Feynman in that regard who basically said yeah the prize is nice but the real the really neat thing
was the discovery you know that's that's what the great and that's and finding that out is cool
it's the thing as you would say is cool and that's what makes it worthwhile of the prize
this I want to end with two things this was a hard book for you to write
it's clear it was a hard book for you to write I mean the agony of some of saying some of the
things that you say that you know it are going to be unpopular or difficult for people to accept
that may sound nutty as you say at one point or another clearly give you pause how do you feel
after having written it nervous as to who is going to feel deeply offended and hurt by it but at
least on a local level as a college teacher I've like flaunted my atheism enough to have a little
bit of experience of the pushback that it gets although mine has always been very compassionate
concerned people who are saying please please please I want to be able to save your soul I love you
your soul is in danger all of it you know what am I expecting with that what I'm expecting
in addition is having to focus a whole lot more on hundreds of pages and decades of thought about
this stuff I don't live this way most of the time I'm hired in judgment and entitlement and all that
sort of stuff and like one percent of the time I can achieve this mindset and because I've been
trying to do it for a long time I like to think I achieve it in circumstances where it's more
consequential like should we consider somebody's well-being and needs to have been earned to be
greater than we consider somebody else's you know let's stop for a second and really think about it
because that doesn't make sense and then I can I can think that way more importantly I can feel
that way for a couple of minutes at a time before it disappears well that's what I was asking I mean
some books I've written I didn't know which I've just changed the way I think about the world without
you know I knew what I wanted to say but having written them they they they allow they help me
personally is this self-help at all having having formulated this in a coherent way
does it help you spend maybe instead of one percent of your time two percent of your time
yes yes and not because this has been a journey of intellectual discovery because oh my god I'm
sitting here talking about this to sorts of people when I do one of those they're going to be on top
of me in a second so I kind of let's try to live this way a little bit more maybe maybe that's the
cynical out you know I once went to one of those dolly llama conferences where he hangs out with
a bunch of neuroscientists and he's got a bunch of his like all-star monks and we all talk to each
other and we realize our vocabularies are so different than you know I did same thing with
the Vatican once and we had nothing to say to each other you're a braver man than me and who you
hung out with and like at one point one of the monks said something about what they do with their
anger and they said something that was totally unexpected and it was gorgeous and it was something
I could never have never reviewed the world for and I said wow that's amazing this guy functions on
a different planet wow that would be and all that's come out of all of this is like yeah like every
now and then I can do that and that's good when you do able to do it but you just said something
that actually was comes to the actually last thing and one of the last pages in your book but
when you said maybe you know it's not right to think that one person's needs and desires are
more than the other and you say the only possible moral conclusion is that you are no more entitled
to have your needs and desires met than is any other human there's no human who's less entitled
than you to have their well-being considered well in fact that's a philosophy which actually
Peter Singer I mean it's fresh on my mind because I've talked to Peter the principle of equal
consideration which he says is true not just for humans you're being you know um speciesist as he
would say but no no being has more entitled than any other being to have their needs and desires
met and not need to suffer it's a so what you've been driven to by this is a beautiful philosophy of
in some sense effective altruism but more importantly the philosophy that that that's led
Peter to I think to be an amazingly ethical individual about about about humans and other
animals it's changed my own thinking I have to say about the world that not I think this argument
can be extended and it's natural to to to beyond humans to other species as well just don't expect
me to find it to be easy to be that way all the time and don't expect it's going to be easy for you
but it'll be a good thing if we do because yeah exactly it's not I'm now I'm now a vegetarian for
example and I wasn't before and it's not you know well it wasn't that difficult um um
but learning the last let me end with the last few sentences of your book because I want to
I think it's nice those in the future will marvel at what we didn't yet know which really
resonates with me because of course as you know my new book is exactly that I love the fact that
it'll be out of date and and the fact that not knowing is what it's all about and that and if
they don't marvel at what we don't know then my goodness we've made a big mistake that we've
progress has ended there will be scholars opining about why in the course of a few decades around
the start of the third millennium most people stopped opposing gay marriage history majors
will struggle on final exams to remember whether it was the 19th 20th or 21st centuries when people
began to understand epigenetics they will view us as being as ignorant as we now view the goitered
presence peasants who thought satan caused seizures that borders on the inevitable but it
need not be inevitable that they also view us as heartless and I think that that's that's important
that means it what you and I've been talking about together that we can learn to change
and be less heartless but only understanding how the world works so I don't view this book
and your work as in any way depressing or pessimistic just as I take the fact that there's no meaning
in the universe it as energizing I take this beautiful piece of work on understanding how
the world really works at the level of behavior as uplifting and a blueprint for thinking about
how can we can make the world a better place so I think you've done God's work as my atheist
friend Steve Weinberg used to say so thank you so very much it's been a blessing to you it's been
a real pleasure and I know I appreciate the time that you allowed me to take of yours and I wanted
to do well I thought I wanted to to give you the time that was necessary I wanted to I wanted to
give it the arguments the time they deserved and we could have spent longer but it's been a pleasure
likewise I hope we could do this in the same room sometime and talk for
hours and hours and hours because looking forward to that it's a it's a real privilege thanks again
