This is a grandad. He's not famous, he's not a model, and he's dressed head to toe in awful clothes from Wish.com.
So why is he getting mobbed by paparazzi at the biggest fashion event of the year?
I'll tell you why.
The fashion world is weird. Banana boats, swimming floaties, whatever this is, they'll tell you you just don't get it.
But I'm here to prove anyone can make it, by taking a regular grandad with zero interest in fashion,
dressing him in the worst outfit imaginable, and taking him to the top of fashion week within one day.
But first, I need to find myself a willing grandad.
So I found eight of the best grandads from across the country, and brought my friends Magnus and Max to help.
Let's f***ing go.
Hello Tim, careful of the steps.
My name's Ray Denkle.
John Kearney Jarrett.
Hello.
Good morning, my semi-eek.
How you doing today?
Uh-huh.
What do you think of the fashion world?
Well, I don't know a great deal about it.
Excellent.
How do you describe your style?
I don't waste too much time, unless I go to a wedding or a funeral.
Yeah.
Watch it yourself.
This is my outfit.
Yes.
I have got beneath it, a character outfit.
After the ride, we got to lick each other's toes a little bit.
This was getting out of hand.
So we decided to role play to test how suitable they were for fashion week.
I am a scary bouncer.
And Tim will say, you want to just come into my party?
Party?
Your name's not on the list.
No.
And...
Action.
Hello sir.
What's your name?
Bonjour.
C'est Timothy, c'est moi.
Have you been in the fashion game long?
For as long as I can remember.
Have you got dementia?
I'm meeting John Pogodier.
Oh right.
That was excellent, John.
But I have a slight suspicion that Sean Pogodier might not be alive anymore.
Ah, this was not going well.
I was worried none of them would be suitable for the chaos of fashion week.
And so we were down to our last grandad.
Yeah, right.
Nice.
Nicely done.
We've had two near casualties today, so we just...
Right.
How you doing?
I'm all right to be here.
My name's Ray Bull.
I'm 76.
First of all, I love your jumper.
You can have it if you want.
I will do this for you, actually.
You just have to jump.
Ray was great.
He was confident, funny.
But could he walk the walk?
Three, two, one.
Frederick, Frederick, Frederick.
FG, FG, FG.
Frederick, Frederick, Frederick.
Frederick, Frederick, Frederick.
And just like that, a star was born.
Raymond Galletti.
Grandson of the Armani founder.
He was born around the same time as him, but that didn't matter.
Nice to meet you.
Lovely to meet you, Ray.
Never see you again, Ray.
It was clear we had the perfect man for the job
with the perfect backstory for Fashion Week.
One week later.
Do you have any grandkids, Ray?
Yes.
Have you told them what you're doing today?
No.
What was it that made you sort of apply for it?
Sounded like fun.
Are you seeing a lot of fun in front of you today?
Yep.
So what Ray didn't know is that I had ransacked Wish.com
for the most random items you could ever imagine.
I'm talking waterproof shoe covers, slippers, chicken leg toy,
Coca-Cola bag, mini umbrella, googly eyes,
and all things purple.
Purple's my favorite color.
And now for my pièce de résistance.
Is there some jacket or something to wear on?
Well, what's that, a bin liner?
So Ray went off to get dressed in some of the items
when the first happy accident happened.
You have put this cardigan on inside out,
but I kind of like the vision.
I had a small body wax yesterday, especially for this.
Good.
I've got no hairs at all.
Ray, you're more hairless than I am.
Yeah.
You'll have to put it back later.
I mean, this has got potential to be an actual hat.
Oh, a bag on my head.
You look like the Pope.
Yeah, I feel like a dope.
Do you want to have a shared channel together?
Why not?
Honestly, there's like a race show.
I don't like the jacket, to be honest.
No?
Oh, dear.
This is my proudest creation, Ray.
Do I wear it or ride on it?
How does it feel, Ray?
Is it a bit stiff?
Yeah, and this is too.
There was only a few final touches
to bring this piece together,
a plastic bag with Barack Obama's autobiography,
a mini umbrella, the Elder Wand.
These are Tamagotchi's, kind of gangster.
Shoes with a Putin-Belen statue and googly eyes.
The shoes are a metaphor.
It's the Russian state always watching.
Oh.
And with that my creation was complete
and what a creation it was.
Jesus.
That looks amazing.
I think we're going to get thrown out rather than let in.
Go, go, go.
Going down.
Someone.
Ow.
Take it, air.
I've got these fuckers crazy.
I do it on the day.
We can't have Ray all by himself. He gets a bit hectic.
So we brought in some muscle in the form of Dave.
Friendly, I walk in a strip club.
A strip club? Yeah.
We'll go in later.
Oh, are we?
I need to scaffold him just to get in the direction.
If Ray was going to do what real celebrities do at Fashion Week,
he'd have to complete three main goals.
Get paparazzi outside of venue.
Make it onto the front row at a show.
Get it to the hottest after party of the week.
It was time for show one.
If we could get the people in the industry talking about Ray,
that'd be the perfect start to the day to help us get some traction for the after party.
The photographers were eagerly awaiting the arrival of real celebrities.
But what they didn't know was around the corner was the newest arrival onto the scene.
Ray Galletti.
As we approached the entrance, it was chaos.
You look great today. What was the inspiration?
Oh, gosh.
I'm breathing.
The photographers began to crowd around.
Okay.
I was keeping moving.
It was even the main show of the day that it was all down to the gatekeeper on the door,
believing the hype.
I don't have you on my list.
Do you have a ticket?
Not on it. Is there any spare seating?
No.
Okay, fine.
Thank you.
It helps.
All right.
Despite getting rejected at the door, the plan was working,
as more and more photographers took photos.
Real guests were being ignored,
whilst Ray's name was being discussed in the fashion world.
Ray Galletti, I think, wasn't he?
Ray Galletti.
Who's that?
He's like a sibling of one of the founders of my company.
What's his name?
Old man.
Ray's name was starting to move up in the fashion world,
but with the first failure, it was important we made the next show count.
This one is a big one.
And as we headed there,
Ray showed me why he's got such a young attitude for life.
That's why I made the show.
Oh, my door.
You know my motto is creating stories for the grandkids.
If we could get Ray to this next show,
it'd be a hell of a story for his grandkids.
So as soon as we arrived, we walked straight to that door with confidence.
Yeah, guys, please, can we hurry?
Thank you.
Hi, are you here for the ticket?
I got my client, Ray Galletti.
Alright, amazing. Go on ahead and join the show.
Hello.
Can't believe how easy that was.
Word Buster travelled fast,
and we made it into our first exclusive show.
Hey, you.
Nice nose.
Look at yourself.
Now back at me.
I bet you didn't know your nose can taste.
That's insane.
How am I just learning this?
Don't you dare switch and let's see, don't you?
Air Up is a sneaky little bottle
that allows you to taste through your nose.
Wait, what?
I can taste through my nose?
No.
Not you, gummy bear.
Not you.
It's simple.
Take your scented pod.
Available in a range of flavours.
Just slide it on the bottle
and activate it.
Turn to normal water
into something that tastes like not water.
Talking about retro nasal smell, baby.
Friends, fun, fruit, flavour.
Start drinking more water today
and get an air up with the link in my description.
And before the show even started,
Ray was getting a lot of attention.
This room was filled with renowned fashion designers and celebs,
but once the show finished,
there was only one person ever on what the photo was.
Do you know who he is?
Who is his name?
Raymond.
Raymond.
Raymond.
Ray was a natural in front of the cameras,
sticking to his backstory well.
Oh, my God.
That's cute.
For the most part.
I have an online fashion and lifestyle magazine in Vienna.
Oh, nice.
So you think Ray's got what it takes to be in your magazine?
Absolutely.
Really?
This is what we need.
Oh, you want to stay with me?
My lucky day.
Thank you.
These two models really took a liking to Ray.
Hello.
So cool.
Can we look at Instagram?
Yes.
Yes.
Catch me on Instagram.
Yeah.
We're absolutely insistent on getting his Instagram.
Look at that.
They're just following us.
Ray's ranking in the fashion world was climbing fast,
and it wasn't long before we got invited backstage by the designer.
That's a big lead today.
Hello.
That's me.
Your name is?
Salette.
I love this piece.
Ray had made some waves in that show,
but everyone knows if you're at the top of the fashion world,
you have to sit in the front row,
but these seats are reserved for the best.
If we could get photographed in the front row,
we'd be building the gulletti name even more.
So we headed to another show,
and there was already a queue forming as we arrived.
They're just killing people in their leg.
It's a very short name.
But with no tickets,
we had to put all our trust in the gulletti name.
Oh, yeah.
I've got Ray gulletti here.
Can I get that?
Yes.
Yeah, we are.
We made it.
This is the entire queue.
I've managed to black away,
so hopefully that means front row.
We got welcomed in so early,
and now we are waiting in front of the friends and family.
All right, off we go.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry.
But if we wanted to secure front row,
we had to react fast.
Oh, my God.
Front row.
We've made it.
New levels have been unlocked.
Oh, wow.
Can I take a picture of you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God.
I love it.
Does it need feeding yet?
Some of the outfits at this show were strange,
but with Ray by my side,
I felt right at home.
This looks like something I would make,
and I think Ray agrees.
Yeah, certain parts of that I like.
I'll tell you what would be better than that,
and I'm like...
Oh.
Safe to say he was having a great time on the front row.
Disgusting.
Disgustingly good.
Disgustingly good.
As the show drew to a close,
Ray once again took the spotlight.
Impeccable today.
Thank you.
Absolutely fabulous.
At this point, it became very clear
these silly items I found on Wish
weren't so silly after all.
I love this one.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, you got one of your stuff too.
Winning.
He's got a penis on his head
because he's a mother.
He's a superstar.
My creation.
Maximus Bucharest never even made it to the front row.
Max, you're nowhere.
They had climbed one step closer
to the biggest after party of the year.
People knew his name.
Photos had been taken.
Front rows had been sat in.
There was an excitement around Ray.
Everyone could feel it.
The after party was three hours away,
and we could barely hold our anticipation.
Okay, Ray needed a nap.
What he didn't realise as he slept,
he was posted on London Fashion Week's
official Instagram page.
But not only that,
he was featured in Bogue's top looks of the week.
Even better.
You're kidding me.
This is the original Fashion Week house.
So I thought ahead of the after party,
why don't we get Max to sprinkle a little something
and change up your outfit
and just slightly to give it that extra edge.
Oh, these are good, some fish slippers.
A dog toy.
The less we talk about that, the better.
Dog toy.
Dog toy.
That's dripping.
I've got what's going to go on Ray's shoe.
You just kicked her in the back.
I've put it on the wrong way around.
Oh, Max.
Smoking can damage the smell.
Oh, everything's just so fucking fashionable.
And with that, Ray's after party bit was complete.
There was just one small thing left to do.
You are the world's most famous model.
Look at this outfit.
Isn't it just amazing?
Not really.
I look better.
Oh, f*** off.
Jeez.
As we approached the scale of the task,
a head started to sink in.
Thousands of people lying the street,
hoping to get a glimpse of the celebrities on the list.
Burrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Serena Williams,
even Justin and Hayley Bieber.
A list of celebs were ridiculous
and we were going to pull up to the front of the queue
and try and skip the entire thing.
Come on, Ray.
The drip lords.
As we got up the Uber, heads were turning.
I'd never seen a queue like this in my life.
They literally stretched a mile back,
everyone in it hoping to get access.
We managed to skip this queue.
Oh, because we're with Ray.
It's been the biggest gym of the century.
We finally reached the front of the queue
and I'd managed to convince the security guard
that Ray was VIP.
See, if you just stay here, I'm going to try.
So we just needed to wait to see if we could get a seat.
Hopefully I've made a huge issue here.
Do you want to come for a go, bro?
Thank you.
It was game on and this was turning into chaos.
The security split the entire queue at the front for us.
I couldn't believe it.
It was a tight squeeze,
especially for Ray and his awful jacket.
Excuse me, guys.
Level one was complete,
but we still had to get past gate two
where they were checking guest lists.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
And without a name on there, this was going to be tough.
Wrong guest list.
Do you know who's guest this is from?
I'm not sure.
I've got my client, Mr. Glettie, here, though.
Can we just stay apart?
Wait on the step for them.
Yeah, of course.
Hi, are you okay?
Hi, are you?
Sorry, we're meant to be at the VIP entrance.
Am I good to go through?
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Take care.
How did that work?
Disgust.
You suck, kids.
What'd you reckon?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That was a joke, Ray.
Manage your manager.
Whoa.
We've just done.
Whoa.
The biggest queue job I've ever seen.
Yeah, wow.
I've done some, but that takes the cake.
It's single-handedly taken Ray from the bottom
to the very pinnacle of fashion week.
Here we go, Ray.
Oops.
That's what it's all about.
And now we were in.
Jeez.
Inside the biggest fashion after party of the year
amongst A-list celebs with a man aged 76
dressed in clothes bought from Wish.
It's just incredible.
It's amazing.
Mind-blowing.
Fascinating.
Riveting.
Brilliant.
Anyone's under nose?
It's everything.
It was only one thing for it.
It was time to enjoy ourselves.
I like pastel.
I hear the...
Bolognese.
Spaghetti Bolognese.
We love that.
We love that.
I love it.
After countless photos and interviews with the top
publications, Ray had now cemented himself
at the top of the fashion game.
I'm going to come down like a busted balloon.
