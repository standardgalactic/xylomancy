Postmodernism presents a threat not only to liberal democracy but to modernity itself.
That may sound like a bold or even a hyperbolic claim, but the reality is that the cluster of
ideas and values at the root of postmodernism have broken the bounds of academia and gained
great cultural power in western society. The irrational and identitarian symptoms of postmodernism
are easily recognizable and much criticized, but the ethos underlying them is not well understood.
This is partly because postmodernists rarely explain themselves clearly and partly because of
the inherent contradictions and inconsistencies of a way of thought that denies that a stable
reality or reliable knowledge exists. However, there are consistent ideas at the root of postmodernism
and understanding them is essential if we intend to counter them. They underlie the problems we
see today in social justice activism, undermine the credibility of the left and threaten to return
us to an irrational and tribal pre-modern culture. Postmodernism, most simply, is an artistic and
philosophical movement which began in France in the 1960s and produced bewildering art and even
more bewildering theory. It drew on avant-garde and surrealist art and earlier philosophical ideas,
particularly those of Nietzsche and Heidegger, for its anti-realism and rejection of the concept of
the unified and coherent individual. It reacted against the liberal humanism of modernist,
artistic and intellectual movements, which its proponents saw as naively universalizing a western,
middle-class and male experience. It rejected philosophy, which valued ethics, reason and
clarity with the same accusation. Structuralism, a movement which, often overconfidently,
attempted to analyze human culture and psychology according to consistent structures of relationships,
came under attack. Marxism, with its understanding of society through class and economic structures,
was regarded as equally rigid and simplistic. Above all, postmodernists attacked science and
its goal of obtaining objective knowledge about a reality that exists independently of human
perceptions, which they saw as merely another form of constructed ideology dominated by bourgeois
western assumptions. Decidedly left wing, postmodernism had both a nihilistic and a revolutionary
ethos, which resonated with a post-war, post-empire zeitgeist in the west, as postmodernism continued
to develop and diversify. Its initially stronger nihilistic, deconstructive phase became secondary,
but still fundamental to its revolutionary identity politics phase. It has been a matter of contention
where the postmodernism is a reaction against modernity. The modern era is the period of history
which saw Renaissance humanism, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution and the development of
liberal values and human rights. The period when western societies gradually came to value reason
and science over faith and superstition as roots to knowledge, and developed a concept of the person
as an individual member of the human race deserving of rights and freedoms, rather than as part of
various collectives subject to rigid hierarchical roles in society. The Encyclopedia Britannica says
postmodernism, quote, is largely a reaction against the philosophical assumptions and
values of the modern period of western, specifically European history. Whilst the Stanford Encyclopedia
philosophy denies this and says, rather its differences lie within modernity itself, and
postmodernism is a continuation of modern thinking in another mode. I'd suggest that the difference
lies in whether we see modernity in terms of what was produced or what was destroyed. If we see the
essence of modernity as the development of science and reason, as well as humanism and universal
liberalism, postmodernists are opposed to it. If we see modernity as the tearing down of structures
of power, including feudalism, the church, patriarchy, and empire, postmodernists are
attempting to continue it, but their targets are now science, reason, humanism, and liberalism.
Consequently, the roots of postmodernism are inherently political and revolutionary,
albeit in a destructive, or as they would term it, deconstructive, way.
The term postmodern was coined by Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard in his 1979 book The Postmodern Condition.
He defined the postmodern condition as, quote, an incredulity towards meta-narratives.
A meta-narrative is a wide-ranging and cohesive explanation for large phenomena.
Religions and other totalizing ideologies are meta-narratives in their attempts to explain
the meaning of life or all of society's ills. Lyotard advocated replacing these with, quote,
mini-narratives to get at smaller and more personal truths. He addressed Christianity
and Marxism in this way, but also science. In his view, quote, there is a strict interlinkage
between the kind of language called science and the kind called ethics and politics.
By telling science the knowledge it produces to government and power, he rejects its claim
to objectivity. Lyotard describes this incredulous postmodern condition as a general one and argues
that from the end of the 19th century, quote, an internal erosion of the legitimacy principle
of knowledge began to cause a change in the status of knowledge. By the 1960s, the resulting
doubt and demoralization of scientists in Lyotard's words had, quote, made an impact
on the central problem of legitimization. No number of scientists telling him they are not
demoralized nor any more doubtful than befits the practitioners of method whose results are
always provisional and whose hypotheses are never proven could sway him from this. We see in Lyotard
an explicit epistemic relativism, belief in personal or culturally specific truths or facts,
and the advocacy of privileging, quote, lived experience over empirical evidence. We see,
too, the promotion of a version of pluralism that privileges the views of minority groups over
the general consensus of scientists or liberal democratic ethics, which are presented as authoritarian
and dogmatic. This is consistent in postmodern thought. Michel Foucault's work is also centered
on language and relativism, although he applied this to history and culture. He called this approach
archaeology because he saw himself as, quote, uncovering aspects of historical culture through
recorded discourses, speech that promotes or assumes a particular view. For Foucault, discourses
control what can be known, and in different periods and places, different systems of institutional
power control discourses. Therefore, knowledge is a direct product of power, quote, in any given
culture and at any given moment. There is always only one episteme that defines the conditions
of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in theory or silently invested in a practice.
Furthermore, people themselves were culturally constructed, quote, the individual with his
identity and characteristics is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies,
multiplicities, movements, desires, forces. He leaves almost no room for individual agency
or autonomy. As Christopher Butler says, Foucault, quote, relies on beliefs about the inherent evil
of the individual's class position or professional position seen as discourse, regardless of the
morality of his or her individual conduct. He presents medieval feudalism and modern liberal
democracies equally present and advocates criticizing and attacking institutions to unmask the, quote,
political violence that has always exercised itself obscurely through them. We see in Foucault
the most extreme expression of cultural relativism, read through structures of power in which shared
humanity and individuality are almost entirely absent. Instead, people are constructed by their
position in relation to dominant cultural ideas, either as oppressors or oppressed. Judith Butler
drew on Foucault for her foundational role in queer theory, focusing on the culturally constructed
nature of gender, as did Edward Said in his similar role in postcolonialism and orientalism,
and Kimberly Crenshaw in her development of intersectionality and advocacy of identity
politics. We see too the equation of language with violence and coercion and the equation of
reason and universal liberalism with oppression. Jacques Derrida. It was Jacques Derrida who
introduced the concept of deconstruction, and he too argued for cultural constructivism and
cultural and personal relativism. He focuses even more explicitly on language. Derrida's
best known pronouncement, there is no outside text, relates to his rejection of the idea that
words refer to anything straightforwardly. Rather, quote, there are only contexts without
any center of absolute anchoring. Therefore, the author of a text is not the authority on its
meaning. The reader or listener makes their own equally valid meaning, and every text, quote,
engenders infinitely new contexts in an absolutely non-saturable fashion. Derrida coined the term
which he derived from the verb which means both to defer and to differ. This was to indicate that
not only is meaning never final, but it is constructed by differences, specifically by
oppositions. The word young only makes sense in its relation with the word old, and he argued
following so sewer that meaning is constructed by the conflict of these elemental oppositions,
which to him always form a positive and negative. Man is positive and woman negative,
oxidant is positive and orient negative. He insisted that we are not dealing with a peaceful
coexistence with visa v, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other,
axiologically, logically, etc. Or has the upper hand. To deconstruct the opposition, first of all,
is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. Deconstruction therefore involves inverting
these perceived hierarchies, making woman and orient positive and man and oxidant negative.
This is to be done ironically to reveal the culturally constructed and arbitrary nature
of these perceived oppositions in unequal conflict. We see in Derrida further relativism,
both cultural and epistemic, and further justification for identity politics. There
is an explicit denial that differences can be other than oppositional, and therefore a rejection
of enlightenment liberalism's values of overcoming differences and focusing on universal human
rights and individual freedom and empowerment. We see here the basis of quote, ironic, misundry,
and the mantra, reverse racism isn't real, and the idea that identity dictates what can be understood.
We see too a rejection of the need for clarity in speech and argument, and to understand the
other's point of view and avoid misinterpretation. The intention of the speaker is irrelevant.
What matters is the impact of speech. This, along with Foucaultian ideas, underlies the
current belief in the deeply damaging nature of microaggressions and misuse of terminology
related to gender, race, or sexuality. Liota, Foucault, and Derrida are just three of the
founding fathers of post-modernism, but their ideas share common themes with other influential
theorists, and will taken up later by post-modernists who apply them to an increasingly diverse range
of disciplines within the social sciences and humanities. We've seen that this includes an
intense sensitivity to language on the level of the word, and a feeling that what the speaker means
is less important than how it is received, no matter how radical the interpretation.
Shared humanity and individuality are essentially illusions, and people are propagators or victims
of discourses depending on their social position, a position that is dependent on identity, far
more than on their individual engagement with society. Morality is culturally relative,
as is reality itself. Empirical evidence is suspect, and so are any culturally dominant ideas,
including science, reason, and universal liberalism. Far more important are the lived experience,
narratives, and beliefs of marginalised groups, all of which are equally quote-unquote true,
but must now be privileged over enlightenment values, to reverse an oppressive, unjust and
entirely arbitrary social construction of reality, morality, and knowledge. The desire to smash the
status quo, challenge widely held values in institutions, and champion the marginalised
is absolutely liberal in ethos. Opposing it is resolutely conservative. This is the historical
reality. But we are at a unique point in history, where the status quo is fairly consistently
liberal, with a liberalism that upholds the values of freedom, equal rights, and opportunities for
everyone, regardless of gender, race, or sexuality. The result is confusion, in which lifelong liberals
wishing to conserve this kind of liberal status quo, find themselves considered conservative,
and those wishing to avoid conservatism at all costs, find themselves defending irrationalism
and illiberalism. Whilst the first post-modernists mostly challenge discourse with discourse,
the activists motivated by their ideas are becoming more authoritarian, and following
those ideas to their logical conclusion. Freedom of speech is under threat, because
speech is now dangerous. So dangerous that people considering themselves liberal can now justify
responding to it with violence. The need to argue a case persuasively using reasoned argument is now
often replaced with references to identity and pure rage. Despite all the evidence that racism,
sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia are at an all-time low in western societies,
leftist academics and social justice activists display a fatalistic pessimism enabled by post-modern
interpretative reading practices that valorize confirmation bias. The authoritarian power of
the post-modern academics and activists seems to be invisible to them whilst being apparent to
everyone else, as Andrew Sullivan says of intersectionality. It posits a classic orthodoxy,
through which all of human experience is explained, and through which all speech must be filtered.
Like the puritanism once familiar in New England, intersectionality controls language and the very
terms of discourse. Post-modernism has become a leotardian metanarrative, a Foucaudian system
of discursive power, and a deridian oppressive hierarchy. The logical problem of self-referentiality
has been pointed out to post-modernists by philosophers fairly constantly, but it is
one they have yet to address convincingly, as Christopher Butler points out, quote,
the plausibility of Leotard's claim for the decline of metanarratives in the late 20th century
ultimately depends upon an appeal to the cultural condition of an intellectual minority. In other
words, Leotard's claim comes directly from the discourses surrounding him in his bourgeois
academic bubble, and is in fact a metanarrative, towards which he is not remotely incredulous.
Equally, Foucaud's argument that knowledge is historically contingent must itself be historically
contingent, and one wonders why Derridaugh bothered to explain the infinite malleability
of texts at such length if I could read his entire body of work and claim it to be a story about
bunny rabbits with the same degree of authority. Post-modernism in the academy, this is of course
not the only criticism commonly made of post-modernism. The most glaring problem of epistemic cultural
relativism has been addressed by philosophers and scientists. The philosopher David Detmer,
in challenging post-modernism, says, consider this example provided by Erezim Kohak.
When I try unsuccessfully to squeeze a tennis ball into a wine bottle, I need not try several
wine bottles and several tennis balls before, using Mills' Cannons of Induction. I arrive
inductively at the hypothesis that tennis balls do not fit into wine bottles. We are now in a
position to turn the tables on post-modernist claims of cultural relativism and ask, if I judge
the tennis balls do not fit into wine bottles, can you show precisely how it is that my gender,
historical and spatial location, class, ethnicity, etc. undermine the objectivity of this judgment?
However, he has not found post-modernists committed to explaining their reasoning,
and describes a bewildering conversation with post-modern philosopher Laurie Calhoun.
When I had occasion to ask her whether or not it was a fact that giraffes are taller than ants,
she replied that it was not a fact, but rather an article of religious faith in our culture.
Physicist Alan Sokolow and Jean-Briegmore address the same problem from the perspective of science,
in fashionable nonsense, post-modern intellectuals abuse of science.
Quote, who could now seriously deny the grand narrative of evolution, except someone in the
grip of a far less plausible master narrative such as creationism, and who would wish to deny
the truth of basic physics? The answer was, some post-modernists. And, quote,
there is something very odd indeed in the belief that in looking, say, for causal laws or a unified
theory, or in asking whether atoms really do obey the laws of quantum mechanics,
the activities of scientists are somehow inherently bourgeois, or Eurocentric, or masculinist,
or even militarist. How much of a threat is post-modernism to science? There are certainly
some external attacks. In the 2017 protests against a talk given by Charles Murray at Middlebury,
the protestors chanted as one, quote, science has always been used to legitimize racism, sexism,
classism, transphobia, ableism, and homophobia, all veiled as rational and fact, and supported by
the government and state. In this world today, there is little that is true fact. When the organizers
of the March for Science tweeted, colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism,
ableism, queer, trans, intersexphobia, and econ justice are scientific issues. Many scientists
immediately criticizes politicization of science and derailment of a focus on preservation of
science to intersectional ideology. In South Africa, the hashtag, science must fall, and hashtag,
decolonize science, progressive student movement, announced that science was only one way of knowing
that people have been taught to accept. They suggested witchcraft as one alternative. Despite
this, science as a methodology is not going anywhere. It cannot be adapted to include
epistemic relativism and alternative ways of knowing. It can, however, lose public confidence
and thereby state funding, and this is a threat not to be underestimated. Also, at a time in which
world rulers doubt climate change, parents believe false claims that vaccines cause autism,
and people turn to homeopaths and naturopaths for solutions to serious medical conditions.
It is dangerous to the degree of an existential threat to further damage people's confidence
in the empirical sciences. The social sciences and humanities, however, are in danger of changing
out of all recognition. Some disciplines within the social sciences already have. Cultural anthropology,
sociology, cultural studies, and gender studies, for example, have succumbed almost entirely,
not only to moral relativism, but epistemic relativism. English literature too, in my experience,
is teaching a thoroughly postmodern orthodoxy. Philosophy, as we have seen, is divided,
so is history. Empirical historians are often criticized by the postmodernists among us for
claiming to know what really happened in the past. Christopher Butler recalls Diane Percus' accusation
that Keith Thomas was enabling a myth that grounded men's historical identity in the
powerlessness and speechlessness of women when he provided evidence that accused witches were
usually powerless beggar women. Resumably, he should have claimed, against the evidence,
that they were wealthy women, or better still, men, as Butler says. It seems as though Thomas'
empirical claims here have simply run foul of Percus' rival organizing principle for historical
narrative, that it should be used to support contemporary notions of female empowerment.
I account to the same problem when trying to write about race and gender at the turn of the 17th
century. I'd argue that Shakespeare's audiences would not have found Desdemona's attraction
to Black Othello, who is Christian and a soldier for Venice, so difficult to understand. Because
prejudice against skin colour did not become prevalent until little later in the 17th century,
when the Atlantic slave trade gained steam, and that religious and national differences were
far more profound before that. I was told this was problematic by an eminent professor, and asked
how black communities in contemporary America would feel about my claim. If today's African
Americans felt badly about it, it was implied it either could not have been true in the 17th
century, or it is morally wrong to mention it. As Christopher Butler says, postmodernist thought
sees the culture as containing a number of perpetually competing stories, whose effectiveness
depends not so much on an appeal to an independent standard of judgement, as upon their appeal to
the communities in which they circulate. I fear for the future of the humanities.
Postmodernism beyond the Academy
The dangers of postmodernism are not limited to pockets of society which center on academia
and social justice, however. Relativist ideas, sensitivity to language and focus on identity
over humanity or individuality have gained dominance in wider society. It is much easier
to say what you feel than rigorously examine the evidence. The freedom to interpret reality
according to one's own values feeds into the very human tendency towards confirmation bias
and motivated reasoning. It has become commonplace to note that the far right is now using identity
politics and epistemic relativism in a very similar way to the postmodern left. Of course,
elements of the far right have always been divisive on the grounds of race, gender and sexuality,
and prone to irrational and anti-science views. But postmodernism has produced a culture more
widely receptive to this. Kenan Malik describes this shift. When I suggested earlier that the
idea of alternative facts draws upon, quote, a set of concepts that in recent decades have been
used by radicals, I was not suggesting that Kellyanne Conway or Steve Bannon, still less
Donald Trump, have been reading up on Foucault or Baudrillard. It is rather that sections of
academia on the left have in recent decades helped create a culture in which relativized
views, effects and knowledge seem untroubling and hence made it easier for the reaction right
not just to reappropriate but also to promote reactionary ideas. This set of concepts threatens
to take us back to a time before the Enlightenment when reason was regarded as not only inferior
to faith but as a sin. James K. A. Smith, Reformed Theologian and Professor of Philosophy, has
been quick to see the advantages for Christianity and regards postmodernism as quote, a fresh wind
of the spirit sent to revitalize the dry bones of the church. In Who's Afraid of Postmodernism,
taking Derrida, Leotard and Foucault to church, he says, a thoughtful engagement with postmodernism
will encourage us to look backward. We will see that much that goes under the banner of
postmodern philosophy has one eye on ancient and medieval sources and constitutes a significant
recovery of pre-modern ways of knowing, being and doing and postmodernism can be a catalyst for the
church to reclaim its faith, not as a system of truth dictated by mutual reason but rather as
a story that requires eyes to see and ears to hear. We on the left should be very afraid of what
our side has produced. Of course, not every problem in society today is the fault of postmodern
thinking and it is not helpful to suggest that it is. The rise of populism and nationalism in the
US and across Europe are also due to a strong existing far-right and the fear of Islamism
produced by the refugee crisis. Taking a rigidly anti-SJW stance and blaming everything on this
element of the left is itself rife with motivated reasoning and confirmation bias. The left is not
responsible for the far-right or the religious right or secular nationalism but it is responsible
for not engaging with reasonable concerns reasonably and thereby making itself harder for
reasonable people to support. It is responsible for its own fragmentation, purity demands and
divisiveness which make even the far-right appear comparatively coherent and cohesive.
In order to regain credibility, the left needs to recover a strong, coherent and reasonable
liberalism. To do this, we need to out-discourse the postmodern left. We need to meet their
oppositions, divisions and hierarchies with universal principles of freedom, equality and justice.
There must be a consistency of liberal principles in opposition to all attempts to evaluate or
limit people by race, gender or sexuality. We must address concerns about immigration,
globalism and authoritarian identity politics currently empowering the far-right rather than
calling people who express them racist, sexist or homophobic and accusing them of wanting to
commit verbal violence. We can do this whilst continuing to oppose authoritarian factions the
right who genuinely are racist, sexist and homophobic but can now hide behind a facade of
reasonable opposition to the postmodern left. Our current crisis is not one of left versus right
but of consistency, reason, humility and universal liberalism versus inconsistency, irrationalism,
zealous certainty and tribal authoritarianism. The future of freedom and quality and justice
looks equally bleak whether the postmodern left or the post-truth right wins this current war.
Those of us who value liberal democracy and the fruits of the Enlightenment and scientific
revolution and modernity itself must provide a better option. Thank you for listening.
