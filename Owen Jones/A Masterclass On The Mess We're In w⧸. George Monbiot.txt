How do we describe our prevailing economic system? It's quite interesting this because
one of the facets particularly of British political debate is this kind of eye-rolling
anti-intellectualism, I suppose, that if you try and describe the system in which we live,
how it works, how it operates, you get this particularly within the British media who don't
particularly like talking about ideas, which I would say helps protect the status quo.
If you talk about this word beginning with N, neoliberalism, the eye-rolling starts,
oh, what is neoliberalism? It's not a thing. This is just some pretentious set of jargon
that you devious leftists have come up with. So, given that nonsense, I'm particularly delighted
to be joined by the incredible George Mobio, who is one of our finest living journalists,
and he's written this brilliant book with Peter Hodgson, who we'll talk about this.
They've never met. This is brilliant. It's a book called The Secret History of Neoliberalism
and how it came to control your life. Hello, George. How are you doing?
Yeah, great. It's lovely to talk to you. It's very lovely to talk to you always.
First of all, yeah, I'm just quite amused by the fact that you've never met. Can you just
explain? People might be listening. You've written a book with someone you've never met.
It's fun. That's a fun idea. I like it. So, Peter is a filmmaker. He lives in California
as a lot of filmmakers do. I don't fly. So, the whole collaboration has been done remotely.
It started off with him approaching me saying, could we make a film together about neoliberalism?
Because this is something I've been writing about for lots and lots of years and trying to document,
trying to pin down, trying to show exactly what the great majority of people have been missing
and how we've been so thoroughly stitched up and also what we can do about it.
And he said, look, this will make a great film. It made films like Requiem for
the American Dream with Noam Chomsky, for instance. And it's a film in that sort of mold.
And so, we agreed to do that. And we did all that remotely, where he got a remote camera
operator in Britain to film me and he directed down the line. And then he said, look, this will
make a great book. We should do this together. And so, we just went ahead on the same principles.
And it's been really amazing, collaborating with a filmmaker, because what you've got there is a
very, very tight editor with a very strong visual sense. And so, he really, he sort of gave the
book its structure and its thrust, a lot of its pace, I think. And it's turned into a very short
and terse and size book whose aim really is to be understood by anyone. We're keeping it really
simple, trying to just write it almost as if we were making a film. And with his influence and
his sort of driving force behind this, I think we've succeeded in that and created something
which is really readable and takes this extremely important subject to potentially
a wider audience. I mean, there must have been a hundred books published on neoliberalism and
some really great books, but most of them are this thick and very difficult to get through.
So, we're trying to do the opposite. I think more than succeeded. It really is a riveting
read, very, very pacey. It is like a film. And I think you're right. I think a lot of people,
they're interested maybe in the idea of neoliberalism, but they probably find it a bit
intimidating, particularly if they see a dense tone. But this really explains it very, very
effectively indeed. So, just what the hell is neoliberalism? Because, you know, we've been,
you've been in this game longer than I have, but you know the eye-rolling I'm talking about,
you talk about neoliberalism. And you say, you know, in the Soviet Union, if the idea,
if you couldn't describe the ideology that ruled us, and I suppose it benefits them to pretend
there is no ideology, it's just what works. This is just a dynamic system. So, what is
neoliberalism? It's much of a dominant ideology in our society, as communism was in the Soviet
Union. And as you say, it's just crazy that most people either aren't aware of it at all, or are
incapable of defining it, or as you say, just dismiss it. If there's no such thing, you're just
making this up. This is a boo word. This is a conspiracy fiction, whatever. And they'll throw
anything they want at you to try to prevent people from getting to grips with what we're seeing here.
And neoliberalism is an ideology whose name was given to it by the original ideologues,
people like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, and others who originally met in 1938,
to help capitalism solve its greatest problem. Capitalism's greatest problem, which it is always
seeking to solve, is called democracy. And capitalism was getting along just fine before
most adults led the vote. And when most adults led the vote, they started using it to say, well,
you know, we don't want to be exploited. We don't want our labor captured and all the value
pulled out of it and given to someone else. We don't want to be treated as modern serfs. We
don't want our rivers polluted. We don't want our air polluted. We want to live in decent housing.
In fact, we'd like publicly funded services as well. In fact, we'd also like a welfare state
and economic safety net, all these things which are inimical to raw capitalism. And
ever since then, capitalism has been trying to fix this problem. And it wasn't particularly
good at it. But neoliberalism has given it the solution. And it's now become extremely good
at fixing this problem and indeed at surviving and expanding even within the nominally democratic
era. I mean, before talking about today, because you look through the history of how this develops,
and I really, I found it fascinating back in, if we go back to the aftermath of World War II,
when if you believed in what is now the central tennis of neoliberalism, it was a bleak moment.
It seemed as though laissez-faire capitalism was buried, the experience of the Great Depression
and then a genocide or war which tens of millions killed. And you couldn't really separate the two
because fascism really exploited the despair that emerged, of course, because of the effects of
that system. And they met in a sleepy Swiss town on Pelerin to organise these economists.
But I mean, at the time, they felt defeated. They were like, we're lost. And it's quite
interesting what happens then because Milton Friedman says, the way you get changes through
a crisis, but it depends on the ideas lying around. So they kind of, they had a don't more
unorganised approach, didn't they really? But they didn't have collective power,
as we would appeal to, they had very rich people who could bank from what's exactly right.
Even so, there's a lot to learn from this movement and how it operated. There's a lot
of strategy which we on the left can pick up and use quite effectively.
And we have to understand how they organised, how they got together. So to begin with,
they start to formulate an ideology, a coherent ideology, one which we can reasonably argue with,
but it had the virtue of coherence and clarity. And effectively, as Hayek and von Mises conceived it,
any form of collectivism would lead inevitably towards totalitarianism. It was one great slippery
slump fallacy of that, if you're saying that if you have a welfare state, if you have publicly
funded services, you will end up with Stalin or Hitler. It's a historical inevitability that
that's the way it's going to go. So we have to sweep the enabling state and all other
implements to capital out of the way to prevent us from ending up with totalitarianism. I mean,
it was a hopefully staggeringly mistaken argument. But the sort of theoretical justification that
they created was that there is a natural order of human life. There are the worthy people and
there are the unworthy people. And the worthy people deserve what they get and the unworthy
people deserve what they get as well. And what they get is distributed to them by this godlike
force of the invisible hand of the market. It's a very Calvinist approach. It's basically
Calvinism done by economists. And this godlike force of the invisible hand, if all impediments
are stripped away, we'll point to those who have the grudge of the invisible hand and we'll point
to those who do not. And we can tell who the worthy are because they're going to be rich and we can
tell who the unworthy are because they're going to be poor. And anything which inhibits the discovery
of that natural order, such as taxation and redistribution, such as regulation, such as trade
unions, such as protesters, such as as we later discovered with them political choice itself,
inhibits the progress of humankind because that progress depends upon inequality. It depends upon
the discovery of the natural order. It depends upon some people being as rich as they can ever
become and other people remaining poor. And yet at the heart of it, because it has to try to sell
itself to the public, there's this massive contradiction which says that if some people
are allowed to become tremendously rich, their wealth will trickle down and then everyone will
become tremendously rich. And you say, now hang on a moment, I thought we were meant to have a
distinction here between the very rich who deserve it and the very poor who don't. But it's just the
first of a series of constrictions within neoliberalism. Now, many people at the time
saw this not just as a highly irrational and contradictory ideology, but also as an obscene
one, one which was destined to return us to the worst excesses of capitalism slash feudalism
slash erontia economy. And so while the books sold quite well, because a lot of powerful interest
got behind them and extracted by reader's digest in IX case, put out to every worker at General
Motors by the management, for example, the ideas remained very unpopular, except with one
particular class of people who were the richest people on earth. And it was literally the richest
people and corporations on earth got together and poured billions into this project and created what
has been described as a neoliberal intermissional, a global network of think tanks in particular,
which are the antique dogs of neoliberalism, these dark money lobby groups such as the
Tufton Street junctings, academic institutions, for example, in Chicago, Virginia and many other
places, tame journalists, tame government officials and tame politicians. And by pouring
money into this and by firing some very clever people to sell these outrageous ideas and to
make them sound like common sense, they began to develop momentum. But even so, they knew they
were in it for the long game. As Milton Friedman, who you mentioned, said, you know, we waited.
And when the time came, we were ready, and we could step right in.
Brilliantly put. I mean, I really like firstly the way that discussion of how
neoliberalism helps rationalize and justify inequalities. When I wrote Charles the demonization
working class a long time ago, 12 years ago or 13 years ago, I said demonization is the
ideological backbone of an unequal society because you have to, inequality is so perverse
if you think about it long enough, but if you say this is just desserts, they're at the bottom
because they're lazy, they're at the top because they work hard. In terms of just that neoliberal
international, those think tanks and all the rest, I think it's really fascinating. One thing I'm
really interested in is you talk about, I guess what it does to us. And, you know, often defenders
of these ideas will often try and talk about human nature, other than the fact we're social animals
who depend on cooperation innately. You know, I don't think that's, there's much biological
mileage in that we're infinitely malleable. But we can be changed, there's no question. And Margaret
Thatcher famously said in 1981, economics are the method, the object is to change the heart
and soul. So I'm just interested in what neoliberalism, what you talk about, what it's
done to us as people, and how this is not kind of an innate human nature thing, which is
So at the start of neoliberal ideology is this Hobbesian idea that we are fundamentally selfish
and greedy. But they twist this to say, that's a good thing. We should mobilize this selfishness
and greed. And by mobilizing it, the rich get richer and that trickles down and enriches everyone.
So that the undeserving poor, oh, hang on a moment, they get some money too. Oh, well, never mind
all of that. So, but the idea is that, you know, we are, we are this sort of hollow economist,
this self-maximizing creature, which is entirely motivated by transactional considerations, by
instrumental drivers. But actually, all the evidence across social psychology, across neuroscience,
anthropology, and several other disciplines shows us that that's simply not true.
We all have some selfishness and greed in this, absolutely. But those are not our primary values.
Those are not the dominant values for the great majority of people. The dominant values are empathy,
altruism, family feeling, community feeling, the wish for a better world, not just for yourself,
but also for other people. And yet we've been instilled in this notion that we are these greedy,
selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. And that's reinforced by the fact that those who come
to dominate us, particularly in the neoliberal, you tend to be greedy, selfish, really quite
unpleasant creatures. I need to put it crudely, we are a society of altruists, governed by psychopaths.
And so that's one of the forces which greatly misleads us about who we are and where we stand.
But another one, as you alluded to, and talking about your brilliant book,
Chaps, is this finger of blame. So just as the rich are told by neoliberalism,
you are rich because you're brilliant, regardless of whether you inherited your money,
you stole your money, regardless of your advantages of education, of class, of race,
whatever that you start off with, you know, you might start in your 100 meter race at 90 meters,
90 meters down the track. But it's still all down to you that you've become so rich. This
self-accribution fallacy is at the heart of neoliberalism. But just as the rich are
congratulated for their wealth, the poor are blamed for their poverty. And if you're poor,
it's because you're unenterprising, it's because you're effectless. If your kid is fat, it's not
because corporations are pushing junk food and the school is sold off, it's playing fields,
it's because you're a bad parent. You're constantly sort of urged to internalize this notion of blame.
And structural failure, systemic failure, these things are simply denied. They're simply airbrushed
out of the picture. It's all about the individual. And, you know, another of Thatcher's famous quotes,
of course, was that people talk about society, there is no such thing. There are men and women
and their families, which kind of was a manifesto. That's how she wanted it. The whole thrust of
neoliberalism and the way by which capitalism defeats democracy is to atomize in rule, is to
tell us you're not citizens, you're consumers. And if you want change, just sit at home and
buy a better brand of biscuits, which, of course, as we know, changes decisively nothing.
Back in 2008, there was the grand financial crash. And we still live in the shadow of that
financial crash. And I think a lot of people at the time, not even just on the left, I mean,
the left was very fragmented. I think this is actually maybe partly answers the point with
the Milton Friedman point about when you have a crisis, what it depends on the ideas lying around
in, I suppose, balance of forces. But nonetheless, a lot of people at the time thought, wow, well,
this is it for neoliberalism. There's not going to recover from this. Look at it.
You know, we can see what's happened with untrammeled free markets, you know,
greed markets out of control. It's caused a catastrophe. It hasn't quite panned out, perhaps,
as some of us might have hoped, from that rubble. And in fact, what we saw instead, Britain and
elsewhere was a doubling down on, you know, austerity rolled back the state. So a crisis of
the private sector became a crisis of the public sector. It was state spending, which had caused
the mess, not the fact that the markets were out of control. What the hell's going on there?
How have we ended up just in constant crisis in this economic system? And I'll be honest,
George, looking at it still here. Yeah, no, it is. And it keeps failing. I mean, I mean,
look at Liz Truss. She was the Uber neoliberal. She just did it by the book. Here's what
neoliberalism tells us will create tremendous wealth and success and prosperity. And we all
saw the instant results. You know, it took one day for her mini budget to completely collapse and
bring down many things with it and cause even greater suffering to the people of this country.
So it keeps on failing and failing spectacularly, but it keeps on walking. It is the zombie doctrine.
So why? Why is this? And I think it's because neoliberalism is something that we don't have.
And that's something is a story, the particular kind of story. So it's our contention that
political and religious change across millennia has always been accompanied by
a particular narrative structure, which enables and empowers that change to happen.
And there are many basic plots, or well, some people say there's just a few and some people
say there's a lot. But anyway, one of them is always this basic plot, which is what I call
the restoration story, which goes like this. Disorder reflects the land caused by powerful
and nefarious people working against the interests of humanity. But the hero or heroes will confront
that disorder against the odds overthrow those powerful and nefarious forces and restore harmony
to the land. And that's the story Marx tells. It's a story that Keynes tells. It was a story
the Nazis and the Flushes told. And it's a story which perhaps for the first time ever quite
consciously and deliberately the neoliberals told. We understood the power of that narrative
structure. And of course, you can slot into that narrative structure, whatever you want.
So Keynes would say the powerful and nefarious forces were unsammled
capitalists. And the hero of the story was the enabling state backed by the middle and working
classes. And the neoliberals turned that exactly the other way around. The villain is the enabling
state and the hero is the entrepreneur fighting for freedom against this totalizing elective
state, which is the great demon that has caused so much disorder. But the neoliberals, they were
very clever in saying this is how the human mind works. This is what attracts us. This is what tells
us who we are and where we stand, where we're going and what we're going to find when we get there.
It is a story. And the story overrides everything. It doesn't matter how much
data you've got. It doesn't matter how good your arguments are. It doesn't matter how consistent
and rational they are. They can be completely inconsistent and rational and frankly bonkers
as some of the neoliberal tracks like IX later put the Constitution of Liberty are. But if there's a
simple and coherent story that stitches it all together, that is what counts. Now
when, after the Great Depression, Payne Stam and wrote what is in effect a restoration story
through his general theory and further writings. And he did it sort of instinctively or so it
seems to me. But of course, he did understand narrative. He was connected with a lot of writers
and he did it very well. And then when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the late 1970s, the
neoliberals had been quite consciously and deliberately polishing this restoration story of
their own. And as Friedman said, they could step straight in and tell that story. This is what's
gone wrong. Here is where you stand. This is what we're going to do to get you out of it and get
you to this promised land. And then when neoliberalism collapsed in 2008, we stepped forward with
nothing. We had no new story. We had lots of brilliant ideas, lots of fantastic policies,
lots of amazing schemes for doing this and for doing that and the rest of it. But we
I didn't brought them together into a coherent narrative structure. And so people couldn't
really hear what we were saying. It's a bit like trying to make a tapestry without a loom.
You've got lots of amazing colours in it. But where's the picture? Where is that a great big
hanging where people can say, oh yeah, there's me in the picture. I can see myself there as part of
this criminal. Unless you pull it all together into a coherent story, you can't reach across to people
and you can't say, here is the answer. Before I ask, just in terms of, I like to always end
on an optimistic note, which given the world of which living, we've got ample material there,
haven't we? But it is just before I just lean into, I'll lean into the bleakness first. At the moment
you can see, and you talk about these right-wing authoritarian movements, we can look at the likes
of the Bolsonaro's, obviously defeated, fortunately, but Bolsonaro is a moe, lives on. The Modi's,
the obviously there's entirely plausible Trump could be become president. And to be honest,
if you'd sped 10 years ago about the prospects of civil war in the United States, people think
you're pretty wacky, but you can't rule out. You can't. The threat to democracy, however
caveated US democracy happens to be right now, is real. And we can see across Europe the rise
of, we've got Orban in Hungary, we've got all sorts of very unpleasant, you might look at
this and think the lights are going out. How do you link these movements to neoliberalism and
are these morbid symptoms? How do you analyse them? So one thing neoliberalism does is to
create state failure. It's failure by design. The state is not supposed to work. I mean, the state
is very powerful under neoliberalism because what makes it different from laissez-faire
economics or classical liberalism, as it's sometimes called, is that it uses the state as a
battering room deliberately to push democracy out of the way, to push trade unions, protesters,
political choice, the administrative state out of the way through this often extreme force.
And then it leaves us, as Tony Judd pointed out in his last book, Il Fez the Land,
just with this authoritarian core, which, and all the state benefits to offer us,
is the demand for obedience and punishment if we step out of line. And so as neoliberalism
captures parties across the political spectrum, which unfortunately we've also seen here in the
UK for 45 years, and boy is it continuing, we end with A, a state which is unable to solve our
problems, and B, a lack of political choice, which is kind of ironic because neoliberalism
is supposed to be all about choice, but as Margaret Thatcher kept saying, there is no
alternative. You've got a full and free choice and there is no alternative. And we end up with
a complete disillusionment with politics as usual. And then that creates an opening for the
Orban's and the Trump's and the Netanyahu's and the Modi's and these other killer clowns who then
move into that vacuum and say, we stand apart from politics, we're the anti-politics people.
We're not immersed in all that elite chatter going on above your heads. We are genuinely
connected to you and they prove that connection by speaking in very simplistic and direct terms.
And so they present themselves as the solution to the crises which have been caused by neoliberalism.
But of course, as soon as they get in, they massively ramp up all of those crises, the
crisis of corruption, of nepotism, of the sale of state assets, of the complete failure to meet
the needs of the poor, of the massively escalating inequality which always follows in their wake.
Depressing, but there is always hope. You've been speaking about what you describe here,
again, as private sufficiency, public luxury for a long time. So in terms of you,
this is important too because we can't obviously not give enough talking to you about the climate
emergency as well and the obvious existential threat to humanity and a profit-driven system
which prioritises profit over the futures of our last species, a bigger problem. But how do
you see that way forward? How do you sketch out this hopeful alternative to what we see there which
is, as we discussed, right wing authoritarian movements which exploit the phase of neoliberalism
and then double down on the very problems which they exploited? So most of the time,
to think to most people, despair seems like the rational option. This is the obvious thing to do
in a situation like this is to despair. Where's the hope? How can we possibly get out of this
horrendous mess? But I think despair is the irrational response to this because despair
is what people feel when they wrongly conceive society as a simple system. Now one of the greatest
failings of our education is that we are never, a great majority of people are never taught the
principles of complex systems. Everything important to us is a complex system, the human brain, the
human body, human society, the financial system, the economic system, every ecosystem, the atmosphere,
the oceans, ice caps, the rest of it, they're all complex systems. And complex systems have
very particular ways of operating. And they have these emergent adaptive characteristics and they
have tipping points and they can very rapidly flip from one equilibrium state to another.
And society is no different from those other complex systems. Society has two equilibrium
states. One is called impossible and the other is called inevitable. And from the perspective of
anything you want to see happen, it's always impossible. Votes for women, you have to be
kidding. Independence for India, you're off your rocker. Civil rights, an end to apartheid,
equal marriage legislation, sexual liberation, all of these things. But when you're pressing for them,
it just seems impossible. You've got this massive brick wall in front of you, it can't happen.
And then it happens and everyone says, well that was inevitable, wasn't it?
And what's happened in these cases is that there's been a flip, a tipping point. Now,
the marriage equality legislation, I think it's a very good example of how that change happens.
Because it starts as it always starts. And I think it was brilliantly done, really
fantastic campaigning. It was very hard. It took a very long time. And it started in a position
where it was regarded as an absolutely horrific idea. This is going to be the end of civilisation,
as we know. Everyone was against it. All the religious organisations, nearly all the politicians,
all the newspapers, the whole lot. And you start, as you must always start, by preaching to the
choir. All my life I've been told, don't preach to the choir. Sorry, but I think the fuck else
are we ever going to preach to? You preach to the choir, but you make it a little bit bigger
every time. You just expand the size of the choir. It's about concentric circles. And you push it,
and you push it, and push it. Until eventually you hit that tipping point, which some research
suggests is about 25% of people. This whole sort of Oxford union approach that you win an argument
and you change things by persuading the person in the opposite corner. It's just complete nonsense.
It's never worked that way. That is not how political change has ever happened. But because
people think that's how political change happens, they think it can never happen. I will never persuade
my grumpy neighbour who reads a daily mail. No, sorry, you don't have to. Persuasion is massively
overrated as a political force. You persuade the choir, and you mobilise them, and you equip them,
and they persuade a few people around them, and they persuade a few more, until you reach that
25% or so of society. And then suddenly two things happen. One, the dynamics of the complex
system kick in, and you can push it towards the sort of tipping point between those equilibrium
states. But two, because we are the uber social mammal, and our whiskers are always twitching to
see which way the social wind is blowing, we don't want to be left behind. And so you'll suddenly
then have this flip, where it's not that everybody becomes the campina for your cause, it's just the
opposition just drops away, because people don't want to feel that they're out of line with the
times. And so what you then find is people who you know adamantly opposed to it, say, well, of
course, I've always supported marriage equality. After the war, everyone becomes a member of the
resistance, right? And so you'll see these sort of sudden flips from what seemed to be an impossible
situation to what then looks like an inevitable change. And we can trigger those, we can
casualize those tippings by telling a powerful restoration story that incorporates our values.
And it's very powerfully done in this book. And that's exactly what this book does. It reaches
people who I think find this whole subject quite intimidating. It's written very beautifully, lots
of clarity, but so much information, very educational, including for people who I think have
maybe read lots about neoliberalism. And it's really, even though it's often talking about
very bleak things, it's full of the optimism for the reasons you talk about. It has a very practical
way forward. And that's what we do need to talk about. So make sure you get a copy of The Invisible
Doctrine, The Secret History of Neoliberalism, and How It Came to Control Your Life by George
Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, who is over in California. But they've both done a brilliant
job, even though they've never met at weaving together this wonderful story. So do share this
video, make sure everyone hear George's voice, obviously, press like, subscribe, hit the,
leave your comments, love to read your comments. But George, thank you so much,
as ever, for your brilliant clarity and wisdom. Well, thanks, Owen, and thank you so much for
everything you do.
