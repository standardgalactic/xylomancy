 Plywood played a crucial and unpublicized role in the success of the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II. The production of plywood involved selecting high-quality timbers like Verge, Maple, and Mahogany, which were first processed by boiling for 24 hours to ensure they had a true roundness. This was followed by a machine planing process to create thin veneers that would be layered and glued to form the plywood sheets.

The glue used in the plywood manufacturing process was part of a closely guarded secret, contributing to the material's remarkable strength. Each layer of wood and glue was carefully stacked, resembling pages in a book, and then compressed under high pressure in a machine press to create the finished plywood product.

This versatile material found various applications in the war effort:

1. **Pontoons:** Plywood was used to construct pontoons for floating boats, enabling regiments to cross rivers during the Normandy campaign.
2. **Folding Boats:** Lightweight but durable plywood boats were essential for forward units, withstanding harsh conditions.
3. **Gliders:** Plywood was used in the construction of gliders that transported airborne troops into battle. The lightness and strength of these gliders were crucial for the success of the airborne divisions.
4. **Mosquito Aircraft:** Perhaps the greatest triumph of plywood in wartime was its use in the De Havilland Mosquito, the fastest operational aircraft at the time, which was used as a fighter bomber to attack targets like Berlin.

The design of these plywood applications aimed to reduce weight without compromising strength, a challenge that also promised solutions to various post-war problems. The plywood innovations in warfare set a foundation for future advancements and demonstrated the material's potential beyond its military applications.
