robert green in studio in the flesh you are actually one of our most requested guests
is that right yeah for the who's the most requested uh dr k the gaming psychologist
don't even know who that is wow have you had him on i have not i've i've i've contacted his people
but um what's so amazing about dr k well he's uh he's a psychiatrist who uh targets mental
health for gamers that's a lot of your audience i guess so a lot of youtube yeah a lot of youtubers
i guess so it's the subtle art of not giving a podcast with your host mark manson
so my first question for you is actually quite selfish as a younger author i i find your career
so fascinating because you have this long history of successful books but it really seems like
there's this resurgence of interest especially in the 48 laws of power over the last few years it
seems like gen z is discovering robert green and you're getting this whole second wave of attention
i'm curious what that experience has been like what that what your thoughts on that are and whether you
feel like you have any control over that or if it just happened well um i don't know it's probably
a confluence of things who knows why things happen in this world it's complex and it's mysterious but i
would say um social media has played a huge role in it because um back 10 years ago or so you know
nobody really know who i was i had no instagram i was a little bit on facebook but i hadn't really gotten
into social media at all i was very very scant on on twitter and so i think a lot of it is about
five years ago some some fans said you've got to get on social media and he took over and he did
it himself for me oh wow and we ended up having to fire him because he was kind of a control freak
but he's a nice guy but he just wanted to like kind of run my empire he would call it my empire he
say your legacy i'm going to protect your legacy as if i'm dead or something so i got rid of him
anyway um suddenly you know it started growing i have this guy stanley who's my assistant who
puts clips and he's very good at choosing certain clips and so a lot of it is social media giving me
a presence you know up until recently i could walk down the street nobody knew the hell who the hell i was
yeah and suddenly people started recognizing me because of this it just exploded yeah you know
even in places like london or paris it's like got this international reach was incredible yeah
and so i have to thank social media for that for paying my mortgage and all the other things like
that but then why has it resonated now and i think um young people are dealing with a world that's so
much more chaotic and confusing some of it has to do with the conditions of the world that we're living
in which is which is as i said much more chaotic than it was maybe 10 15 years ago some of it has
to do with the parenting issues how differently they have been raised and the culture that they're
entering and so because of that's feeling kind of very lost and confused the 48 laws of power
kind of gives you sort of a grounding and kind of the the dark harsh aspect of life because i i don't
know i'm not gen z so it's hard for me to generalize of course it's ridiculous to generalize right but a
lot of them feel maybe they've been a little bit sheltered from that kind of harsh aspect of life
i know when i was 21 if i can remember back that far i entered the work world out of college
and i i was a liberal arts major ancient greek and latin you can't get any more irrelevant subject than
that my first job was a real job because i had many different my first real job was at esquire magazine
i was the lowest editor there an editorial assistant it was like mind-blowing i couldn't believe power
games that were gone because nothing in college prepared you for that all the egos of the writers
and the editors the celebrity the weirdness i once edited an article by john irving you know the writer
yeah he turned in a travel article about vienna because i was like the travel editor it was such
a bad article it was like go to this cafe turn right and then go here and then turn left and go
it was like that kind of writing i edited totally i made it like a narrative and i got essentially fired
because of that or got demoted i had outshone the master law number one so it was this rude awakening
into this is what the world is really like i had to school myself very quickly and then with my 50
different jobs i learned over time this is how the world is young people are going through that but times
10 because the world is even more confusing they're not used to dealing with all of these egos to all
the political games so i think i can't say for sure but i think these are some of the components that go
into this revival of the book it's selling five times more than it ever did 20 years ago so it's
insane yeah i feel like cynicism travels on the internet faster than it does in real life and i
think as a generation that grew up on social media and grew up on the internet what i detect from gen z is
just is kind of an an embedded cynicism about the world and and like is that right skepticism and and
i i could see why a book about power appeals to that it's like okay well this book's gonna just cut
through the and actually tell me what's going on um so i the appeal makes sense but i'm not i'm not a
cynical person i know people think of the book as cynical but i don't really think of it as cynical yeah
because cynical is is basically uh you know leaning into all the bad things in life etc and it's not
very realistic because not all life is bad there are bad people out there i just think the book is
realistic yeah for sure because i'm not a cynical person at heart you know i'm actually got unfortunately
more of a romantic naive streak and i think it in some weird way that comes out in the book but yeah
it's interesting you know you and i have met in person a few times now and i imagine the the
image that people get from reading your books versus how they see me how you actually are in
person like i do you get people like assuming that you're like trying to pull puppet strings and
manipulating them yeah like i'm five minutes late for a meeting it's not because of the traffic it's
because i'm playing some kind of weird game on them you know they're like a small 27 or whatever
yeah yeah um i know i've said i've told this story before but when i met 50 cent for the uh first time
before we ever thought of writing a book together he was like he later told me he was kind of a little
bit intimidated by this he expected an older man he looked like henry kissinger to show up when we first
met yeah and then he was kind of surprised maybe even a little bit disappointed that i wasn't like that
of course i had the same impression about him i was expecting someone really kind of mean and
intimidating and thuggish and he was the sweetest gentlest nicest person you could ever imagine yeah
but yeah people expect this that everything i do is a power move it's but it's not true yeah do you
just kind of see that as the cost of the success of the book you know because it's i i get this with
my books like people make assumptions about me that i'm and then they meet me in person they're like oh
you're not like that at all like well you do you do give a don't you of course yeah of course okay
no i'm just kidding um yeah but you're outing me robert you're outing me exactly sorry sorry you can
start being mean to me now show people you know there's a theatrical element to the social world
which i embrace and i think is kind of fun and interesting and it's part of the 48 laws of power so
when you enter the world you're not yourself i think it's something a mistake people make they
have no distance between their inner self and their public self so they enter the work world and people
are different and weird and stuff and they take it personally and i try and instruct people it's not
personal it's a game people are wearing masks it's like something from the 18th century where people are
in costumes and they're in theater and they're performing people are constantly performing well i'm
performing as well and so if people have this image of me as this dark sinister figure sometimes you
know i don't mind i might lean into it a little bit i might give that out that impression because i
kind of enjoy that i kind of enjoy playing that role sort of thing yeah you know i don't have a
problem with it yeah but it's not really who i am right right um tell me about in in your book
mastery you talk about finding your life task and from what i know about you and from the bits and
pieces i've read about you and talked to you you seem to know pretty early on that you wanted to be
an author you seem kind of just built yes to be a writer like what was your process of searching
and discovering and finding what you consider your life you know i my story was was fairly clear
mm-hmm i mean like you there's it goes up and down it's not it's never like a straight path of
course but um when i was very young i loved writing um i wrote i i believe i wrote something like a
novel when i was about nine years old oh wow and it was about um our early early humans first entering
the scene you know walking in the savannas of africa i'm nine years old and it's told from the point of
view of a vulture who's watching them no i'm sure it's terrible but for a nine-year-old that's
impressive that's very impressive yeah i was really obsessed with vultures and i did little sculptures
of vultures yeah so you kind of see the dark side already there when i'm nine years old but um and so
you know i love i love words just the sound of words the sensuality of words the weirdness of you
know i just i never took language at its face value i thought there's something strange that we speak in
words that we have these symbols that we take for granted that we talk so smoothly but they're not
they're weird that these little squiggles that mean something that have a sound attached to them
as a child this is really strange i was obsessed with words i played with words i still do that to
this day i love like palindromes and word games and such so words obsessed me and obviously i wanted
to be a writer i thought when i was 18 in my drug days that i would be a wild novelist you know that
was my real dream i still am kind of a a failed novelist so to speak and so i tried as i've told
people before i tried many different types of writing i tried journalism i hated it i failed at it it
wasn't a good fit i tried writing novels bumming myself around europe with a backpack i failed at that
i came back to la tried to be a screenwriter i failed at that these weren't fits for me because
i have a weird mind and i'm also a control freak and i didn't have any kind of control in hollywood
and so you know i lucked into the 48 laws of power by meeting this man in italy we were there to start a
new media school for benetton some weird project like that it was it was kind of a meaningless
venture it really was about being in italy and having good pasta and espresso and wine it wasn't
about getting anything done if you know the italians yeah this is the land of machiavelli and so he had
jost and i the man who did that we kind of bonded over it one day in venice italy were because it was
near venice and we were walking he said do i have any ideas for a book and the 48 laws of power just
like almost like i vomited out of me i kind of improvised the gist of it actually i told him a
story the story that opens the book i said this is how i'd illustrate it he said that's fantastic
i'll pay you to live while you write the book because i was very poor and so i kind of found my
way in this kind of circuitous way manner to what i was really meant to do but the lesson i think for
people because i get so many emails people telling me i don't know what my life's task is i can't
figure out what my purpose is can you help me can you help me and there are signs i believe everybody
has signs and these signs come out a lot of them are negative signs which you're not paying attention to
things that you hate things that frustrate you so you're in music it isn't quite working you feel a
little bit uncomfortable it's not a fit yeah so you make the wise decision that it's not for you to
get out other people they maybe feel that frustration but they don't go there they go oh i've already
trained as a musician i got to stick with it they go and then they've then they burn out that 30 years
old and it does it's not working for them they go what's my life's purpose i have no idea you've got
to listen to the signs sometimes the signs are physical they're literally in your body you literally
feel frustrated you literally feel like you're swimming against the tide it's not working for
you you get up in the morning you're not interested in this so the negative is very important but also
there's the positive you know so for me the negative was i hate i actually hate office politics which is
very ironic for me yeah you know who wrote that i couldn't i can't stand working for other people
and so i have to work for myself i have to be an entrepreneur i have to write books
i have to have control but then there are the positive signs there's the signs of things that
you love that you're passionate about they generally show up when you're very six seven eight years old
and so i tell people you've got to go through that process you have to reconnect with the child inside
of you because children are dreamers every child thinks i'm going to be president i'm going to write a
great novel i'm going to do this out of the other then those dreams slowly get squeezed out of them
right but you have to return back to that you have to have a little bit of that
expansive quality that a little bit of imagination even a little bit of naivete
and go back to who you were and go back to the things that excite you in a way that you can't even
explain you know the the negative feedback thing one thing i notice in a lot of people you know
there's this narrative around grit persistence uh hustle culture right like what i notice with a
lot of people is when they start running into that resistance and it doesn't feel right it feels
painful the first thing they tell themselves is like oh well i just need to toughen the up and
keep going because this is this is what you know all my heroes did is they just kept fighting through
it and it's i think it's such a it's so much more nuanced than that of like understanding when to
push through and when to to let go well the the subtle art should be actually the title of your
next book because it is subtle it is nuanced life is not so obvious so sometimes grit and persistence is
the right way yeah so for me writing i failed at all these different aspects i didn't give up i didn't
say all right my parents wanted me to go to law school wanted me to settle down wanted me to
take these awful television jobs that i had you know and i can i've had the worst television job
you can imagine i won't even say that um they want me to settle down you know i had to have the
persistence to go no i'm going to do this i'm going to stick with it i have faith in myself even
though i got very depressed but also sometimes persistence can be exactly the wrong thing right
and the key is the key to everything in life is knowing what you really truly love what you were
meant to do why you were born why you're a different individual you know i i know it sounds
like a cliche but everybody your dna is unique there's never going to be another mark manson
the way your brain is wired the way your parents raised you your early experiences you are unique
and so that is where your power lies and connecting to that is is is the source of everything in this world
so if you connect to it if you know who you are you know what you love you know what you were meant
to do and it's not a cliche it's actually very real then that persistence will become an actual
positive thing in your life because you'll know i can't keep kicking against a wall here it's not
what i was meant to do i got to get out yeah you know so i was 25 26 years old i was in new york
working in journalism i had a meeting with an editor after i wrote an article and i didn't know what the
meeting was for and he was kind of an alcoholic he was like on his second or third martini at lunch
and he was said basically said robert you're not a good writer you're not going to make it in this
world you need to go to business school you're not disciplined you're all over the place you don't
understand your audience right and so i could have like said you i could like stayed in journalism i'd
probably be dead by now i'd probably be an alcoholic because it wasn't right but i listened to it and i
go you know there's something true there it isn't right it isn't a good fit i'm hitting against a wall
i got to get out and i got to try something else yeah but if you don't know who you are if you don't
know what marked you as a weird person when you were a child then you're lost in life you have no
radar one thing that i tell people all the time is is i ask them uh what's the form of pain that you
enjoy that most people can't tolerate right like it's and you don't mean like in a kinky way no not
in a kinky way no no yeah well you know we don't judge here at the solar podcast but but um
um just wanted to clear that up yeah keep it a pg-13 robert sorry uh um what is the the challenge
or struggle that that you kind of relish like you kind of you know like i know for me and i imagine
it's similar for you like when i'm in the hole with a book when i'm like just deep deep deep in a
mess of a draft and i'm like agonizing through it i'm laying awake at night yeah you know what i'm talking
right now you know what i'm talking about there's still kind of a sick part of me that like likes
it yeah like there's something thrilling about it yeah and and and i think most people they can't
stomach it whereas like in music school like i remember the moment i i decided to drop out of
music school i remember i was practicing four to six hours a day what did you play uh guitar uh so i was
practicing four to six hours a day on top of all my classes and i remember i went into one of my
private tutors and tried to play a song for him and he just looked at me and he's like you know
what your problem is you don't practice enough and like that was the moment i was like i'm done
i i like i can't and and was the practice painful but not in a good way correct yeah it was it was
drudgery yeah um and it to me that was a very profound lesson you know because i loved performing
and i loved getting attention because i could play some song or some solo but i didn't like practicing
and musicianship is actually practice it's all practice it's the 99 practice one performance right
so um it was a very painful lesson of like you think you like this but you don't actually like it
wow that's very interesting yeah well um you know when when you love something when you really are
when you have that connection like i'm talking about then the practice you you enjoy it you enjoy
learning yes because you enjoy the process of getting better and you can feel your brain kind
of tingling and things are happening inside and i tell people if you have found the right path if you
are like an artist or creative and you feel frustrated and you feel blocked that's a good thing
right that little bit of pain a little bit of frustration it's often a signal that you're
actually on the verge of turning into the right direction you know it's a signal that things aren't
quite working out and you're listening to it but if you get anxious and you don't listen to the
frustration and you can't be creative you can't go into it yeah but you'll learn at a much higher rate
and you'll enjoy because anything as i said in mastery everything involves a degree of pain
a degree of practice a degree of drudgery yeah there's nothing that's going to come easy in life
so anything skill that you're going to learn it's going to involve that and if you're not connected
to it in a deep late way like you weren't with music you're never going to get you're never going
to learn fast enough you know and and you're just going to drive you're going to burn out too early so
yeah what about robert what about reconnecting with that that life task and going back and finding
that because i think um you talk about a lot of the negative signs yeah i think people can get stuck
everything is just a negative sign they're like and they completely forget mark you you said that
you got disconnected from that at one point and you kind of by chance stumbled back into it robert it
sounds like you kind of always knew you wanted to be a writer of some kind there are a lot of people
who just they feel like i they don't even know what that is to begin with so can you talk a little
bit more about like uncovering that that connection to your life task well it's a good back you know
to childhood or whatever it is it's a good question because a lot of people they only know the negative
they only know and then you kind of beat up on yourself and then you start doubting yourself and
you think well maybe there's nothing that i'm really good at maybe i just need to go make a lot of money
which i'm not against making money i mean i'm not telling people to say oh i meant to be a poet which can't
make a living off of you have to be able to put food on the table if you're supporting a family
etc so being able to make a living is important right but you don't have to compromise completely
in that so finding that positive element well the first thing you have to do is it's a process
and people are so impatient they are so unused to being to introspecting and being able to
introspect is a very very powerful tool and what that means is you have to be able to examine yourself
and in our culture we're so outer directed we're so directed towards what other people are doing
to the social world that the idea of who am i what was i like as a child what do i really love
is alien to people i can't understand it because i've always i'm a very introspective person but a lot
of people have a hard time with that concept and i encounter that when i try and counsel them
so i tell people you have to be patient it's not going to come in a light and a flash of wow i was
meant to be a sculptor here where i go right okay so you've got to be patient you got to take a book
and you have to make a journal if that you know i think it works for a lot of people and you have to
start going through this process and yeah and i tell people look for the signs of things that excited
you that excite you in a way that you can't even really control because we live in a culture that is
so damn rational everything is an algorithm everything is generated by data but this is a feel this is not
data this is a feel this is an intuition this is something that excites you in an intuitive way
and there's no algorithm in the world that i could invent or any genius could invent to help you find
that it's a feel it's subtle it's inside of you but if you can't go inside of yourself if you're so
not into looking into who you are all the advice in the world will be will be useless and i and i tell
people that i can't help you unless you're willing to go through that process and some of that examining
is tough some of it is yeah i had a rough childhood yeah i i had these fantasies but they weren't
necessarily positive you're going to come upon negative things you know and i you know i had a
lot of negative things in my childhood too so you have to be willing to go through that that digging
you're like an archaeologist with your own past you're digging in there looking for the signs and
they're there when you were five years old four years old you were naturally excited by certain
things the other thing i tell people is we've got to get away from this idea of intelligence as just
being intellectual there's a book i recommend a lot of people i probably over recommended it
by howard gardner called the frames of the five frames of intelligence i'm probably i'm always misquoting
but it's something like that you'll find it and he's basically a a neuroscientist he's a scientist
of some sort and he said there are five forms of intelligence there's kind of a mathematical
intelligence that's due with patterns often related to music there's a social intelligence that has to
deal with dealing with people there is kinetic intelligence which is moving the body right sports
or dance or whatever there's word intelligence there's that kind there's another one i can't
remember what it is imagery or something like that every brain has that natural inclination towards one
of these intelligences right and you have that as well i compare it to like a grain that's inside of you
and that you have to move with that green you have to find it and it's one of these forms of intelligence
you have it yes you can have two but if you have two or three it starts i don't know you're gonna
get a little bit lost you're a polymath and that maybe you're a genius or maybe you're just confused
but um you've got to find that one thing right and if it's sports if it's dance that's intelligence
kobe bryant my my idol because i love basketball he's as intelligent as as he's a michelangelo on the
basketball court you know it's intelligence parents like to say well no you've got to go to law school
you've got to be this you got to be an academic blah blah blah no it's whatever is that grain of
your brain that is natural you've got to find that and so don't think in terms of i want to be this
specific job or whatever think in terms of what is that natural form that my brain is veers towards and
now if you know that you're somebody who has a mathematical abstract mechanical like brain
all right let's go into that let's go deeper now let's find if you're an engineer or if you're a
musician or okay but you got to go back and you got to dig i could go on for hours about some of the
process that i go through people that should give you an idea of some of the positive things that you
can do yeah but it is a process that's what i like about it yeah it's not the lightning bolt like you
said it's not no and it also never completely ends it's not like no for sure you don't just
like find the thing and you're like cool i'm set like there's every five ten years something happens
in your life or you evolve or you change a little bit or definitely your preferences change you know
so it's it is it's a perpetual thing for sure um you know some people like they get tired of the
thing they've been doing for 10 15 20 years and then they go try something different and i often
counsel you don't want to go like you know you're a writer and now oh no i'm going to be like uh i
don't know choose something totally irrelevant from that whatever programmer or something yeah okay
that's not you should you should go off in a different direction within writing or something
right um and so you get bored and the boredom either means i've got to change my job or means
i have to change something within my job and i prefer the something within my job so how i personally
deal with it is every book that i write is on a completely different subject i never repeat the same
book twice i'm onto something that is not the book i'm writing now people are going to be shocked
because it's completely different from anything i've ever written so i don't get bored i'm
constantly challenging myself yeah yeah cool we will be right back
you've probably heard of seen or read this book i'm mark manson the author of said book
after it became a new york times bestseller i wanted to do something else that wasn't just
writing another book so i launched your next breakthrough it's a free email newsletter with no gimmicks
and no just a five minute read each week with one idea one question and one exercise that could spark
your next breakthrough over a million people are already signed up so just click below to get in on
the action for free all right we're back so robert we do a segment uh that drew and i love called
brilliant or which is we take recent scientific research surveys new theories things that have kind of
become popular or become talked about and we discuss whether we think it's brilliant or whether
it's so we want to we want to include you on this round we want to hear your opinion we have something
selected yes for this brilliant or robert we're talking about peter pan syndrome um now there's a lot
of talk about how men are checking out um they're not getting jobs not getting educated not committing
uh to long-term relationships sitting at home playing video games watching video games vaping
watching porn yeah there's a female version of it too called the cinderella syndrome but it's the
the peter pan syndrome is really the uh in the zeitgeist more and more and actually there are some
recent studies that are trying to quantify this and and and label it a a i wouldn't say diagnosable
syndrome but they do call it a syndrome and um they suggest therapy for it what i would like to ask
you first of all do you think it calling it a syndrome is brilliant or bullshit i think i know what you
would think about that but um what do you think the main drivers really are is there a problem of
prolonged adolescence what are the drivers of that prolonged adolescence should we be um therapizing it
so much too well you know um syndrome yeah that's a bit of bullshit it's a bit like people like to talk
about things these days because everybody's an individual everybody has their own childhood their own
background their own reasons for wanting to stay in adolescence and there are plenty of people in my
generation particularly in my generation who got stuck in adolescence and are still stuck there so
it's not necessarily endemic just to gen z it's a phenomenon that has existed i'm not saying forever
certainly not but since the reign of popular culture probably since the 1950s the peter pan phenomena has
become more and more pronounced and um what was the second part of the question uh what do you think
is driving it oh yeah right yeah well i mean as i said everybody's going to be different i know that's
not a good answer for you but i think a lot of it is it's a very strange time to be a male to be a boy to
be a man it's a very confusing time and so i think that's a lot of the source of it because when i was
growing up i'm sounding like i'm 100 years old when i was 30 i hated hearing that stupid ass expression
when i walked 12 miles to school in the snow yeah um anyway uh you know there was there was this being a
male was a obviously positive because it was a very male-oriented culture but you know it was
there was no sense of confusion about it really although some people were confused um and there's
nothing wrong with that but you know there were icons in sports in in movies you know the kind of
the rugged masculine hero but in all aspects of life you know i remember as a kid i was i'm so old that
as a three-year-old i can remember john f kennedy on the television you know that that got that i
was fascinated by him i thought this was it was a man who was very commanding he was a president but
there was also a weird kind of softness to him like a strange poetic side to it i drew me in there
were these icons and so you didn't feel you wanted to grow out of adolescence you wanted to become
a man you wanted to enter the world and be and kind of follow in the footsteps of some of these
people that you admired but now it's like being man being a male being masculine is almost ugly it's
dirty it's almost like something you have to wipe off your skin oh you know toxic masculinity but you
know there's something you have to say about testosterone it can turn ugly but it drives you it makes
you do things it's got a positive element it gives you ambition it makes you go out and do things
12 000 years ago it made you go hunt mastodons and kill them with your club with your other members
right there should be positive things about being a man and so then i don't want to stay in adolescence
i want to don't stay in this little cocoon with my mommy and my daddy in my home playing games i want
to go out in the world i want to conquer i want to have ambition i think the root of the problem is
that there's no kind of positive masculinity out there and so it doesn't give people an incentive to
get out of that little kind of adolescent cocoon right i agree a hundred percent it's funny we were
joking around about dr k at the beginning of the show oh yeah i think one of the reasons why he's become
so popular is there's this whole demographic of young men who are kind of checked out and they're
playing video games all day and he's one of the only popular mental health voices that's speaking
directly to them saying hey you're playing too many video games let's talk about it how can like how can
we get you back out in the world i definitely see you know a big portion of my audience is younger men
i definitely have noticed this over recent years and and i'm becoming a little alarmed by it i agree
that there's there's a lack of clear role models there's a lack of there's there's not a road map
right like it's not obvious to a a 17 year old male who to be who they want to grow into right and
that's that's difficult and confusing and then i think the ease of checking out today is exactly is so
much i mean i struggle i mean i'll download a game on my phone and and i'll be lost for two hours
right like yeah it's it's tough man it's so it's like and i've got a fully developed prefrontal cortex
like imagine an 18 year old like he's so it's it's um i i really really sympathize um with a lot
of the young guys today and and it's i definitely see it as a problem it does seem to be a growing
problem the syndrome thing makes me uncomfortable and i'm curious what your thoughts are on on kind
of this there seems to be a little bit of a recent tendency to like medicalize everything yeah and uh
especially things that were just kind of not normal behavior but not necessarily abnormal behavior say
20 or 30 years ago either like what like a peter pan syndrome like like when i was i remember when i
was in college we used me and my friends we used to go out with this guy who was around he was a
divorced guy around 50. a ton of fun awesome dude and we used to go out in the parties and clubs with
him and uh and we used to joke like oh yeah it's peter pan over there you know like um but he was you
know he was in this phase of his life he had just gotten out of a marriage and you know he was well you
can be a functional peter pan totally there are a lot of there are a lot of people out there who are you
know people like bill clinton was a functional peter pan yeah i see them all the time it's the
boomer generation i'm a little bit younger than that yeah it's full of very functional peter pans
i'm a functional peter pan very true it's very true i've been accused of the same as well yeah
so i mean well this is exactly my point right is that that until i guess a few years ago this was
just kind of like something that you would casually talk about in conversation or like oh yeah he's a bit
of a peter pan you know he still goes up to clubs but now yeah there's researchers now there's a
syndrome have a syndrome social problem making recommendations to therapists are they actually
like medicating people for this no no not not that i know of yet this the paper that kind of
operationalized this as an actual psychological phenomenon you know is in 2021 um and they don't
give any recommendations for like uh medications or anything like that but they do say therapists who
are seeing this all around the world should be aware of it and uh-huh to me that just i'm not
sure about that yeah i mean we can't send all of our kids to therapists you know and um also
you know it's like there's too much talking going on in this culture and not enough acting
i love that i just want to like take that clip
that's the episode there's too much talking
it's i know where you're going with it it's so true it's sorry continue no no no but sometimes
you just got to get off your ass and you got to act you got to do things in this world and that's
the best therapy in the world yeah yeah you know so i make the analogy in in my book and in some of my
talks that i see how the power and and the life out there in in our in our work world as a game it is
a power game and i frame it that way and you're maneuvering you're constantly maneuvering it's this
fluid game that you're playing where the parameters nobody really sets the rules aren't that aren't
very clear cut but there are certain laws laws of power that you can operate to to get ahead it's the
most amazing game you could ever play and you should enjoy and you should have fun well you
know let's start talking about things like that that like life is a game get out there and be active
you know when it comes to dating stop all this with your phone go out to bars go to supermarkets
pick up learn how to pick up on women learn how to get over your fears and actually interact with them
so start acting and stop talking and stop over analyzing things but actually act in the world
that's to me the greatest therapy in the world i i i as someone who for better or worse kind of
operates within the self-help industry this is this is my personal pet peeve it's the thing that drives
me insane is is there's seems to be there's so much emphasis put on awareness like let's be aware
of our problems let's be aware of our emotional issues let's be aware of our mental health problem you
know and it and it's it's people treat that as an end of it in itself like well the fact that we're
sitting around talking about our trauma and our baggage uh you know we're doing the work they even
call it that doing the work and i'm with you i'm like okay that's great we can talk until we're blue in
the face but until you actually go and behave differently until your behavior has shifted in some
tangible way what is it what what does it matter what are we doing well uh i don't know if i can
remember it exactly right because it's about a chapter i was writing uh just a few months ago and
i've already forgotten it um but there was a psychologist professor at ucla named schwartz i
forget his first name his study was ocd right this is back in the 80s when people were first calling it
a syndrome and so much of the therapy was a talking therapy right and giving them these these certain
ideas about let's talk about let's figure it out he came up with these action strategies he literally
had you go out and do things that were your biggest fear because ocd is all about fear right so if you're
afraid of germs go out and rub your hand in some dirt or whatever he had them do this over time
he took brain scans and their brains were literally changing the brain was rewiring itself through these
action strategies so when you take action your brain changes it adapts that's how the human brain is
but if you're always internal if you're just talking about things none of that stuff is going on because
it's not it's not how our brains are wired yeah and it's i feel like the danger in it is that it can
like let's say you and i have a very profound conversation it gives you the illusion that
something has changed yeah even though we're still sitting yeah on the same damn couch yeah
doing the exact same thing we were doing 30 minutes ago right and so i i see that all the time that that
so much of of this industry is just built around giving people the sensation of having a change happen
without any necessary behavior shifting i'm going through something similar to you like um questioning
and wondering about the self-help thing and whether i'm just part of that problem as well whether i'm
just a bunch of words but i think that at least i know that my approach is to give people maps on how to
act yeah and i'm very much against over analyzing and talking things to death yeah and it's talking
is is necessary but not sufficient no definitely not yeah for sure great all right we solve peter pan
syndrome we'll be right back hey everybody mark here quick little favorite ask if you're watching

why not leave a review and let us know how we're doing and in case it needs to be said thank you for
listening and watching wherever you are it does mean a lot to us namaste motherfuckers
and we're back all right we've got we've got questions for robert we do but we do we have some
some listener questions this one actually came in from spotify and mark and i recently did an episode
on um behavioral change and there was this big study where um some psychologists came up with
all these interventions to get people to go to the gym more and it turns out they were terrible at it
uh it came up who's terrible at it the psychologists were terrible at coming up with these interventions
that would work and we got a question in response to this that i think was a really good one for you
robert um it comes from ian uh who says as as bad as modern psychology is at helping people
uh is our current best bet given uh that it's at least based on science or is this the wrong
approach given that science doesn't tell us what's right and wrong and we should instead turn to things
like timeless philosophy basically the question is is like what's the value of science and behavioral
intervention specifically in our lives you mentioned a little bit already that you were skeptical of oh we
need all this data to make a decision or we need we need some sort of guidance from above to help us
make these decisions what's your what's your take on this well i mean it is it related to like something
like going to the gym or exercising or what is in relation to that was what the question was but i
think the larger question is how much should we lean on science uh or you know the behavioral science
academia in general i think for uh improving our lives well i'm old school you know i'm an old guy
let's let's not you know call spade a spade here and um i think it's i mean look what happens with big
data and with algorithms and we've seen it with facebook early on is you think that you're accumulating
big data about how people actually are but what you're actually doing is you're changing who people
are you're changing their behavior because now you're feeding them the very algorithms that you
think that they are that involve their behavior and then you're turning them into lemmings everyone a
herd everyone's now going to be responding the same way but you're an individual it all starts with who you
are as as a as a human being as an individual born into your body with your parents with your
background with your genetics okay big data doesn't have anything to do with it doesn't know what that
is ai can't possibly see into that so i'm more of the timeless wisdom type person but i really think
you have to know who you are in a gut way and you know we're talking about awareness and talking and
talking has has has its value as we were saying as we were talking but there's also this very
important gut element of knowing what you know what makes you different what motivates you what what
you were meant to accomplish what you hate what you love and if you're constantly looking for science
and big data and algorithms to solve all your problems well you're not because you're running away
from the only source of your of your salvation which is you as an individual i'm going to sound
like a a nutty preacher we do not have enough individuals in this world we do not have enough
weirdos we do not have enough people who are happy to be unique and different and no amount of ai
in fact all of that stuff is turning you into just a glob a big social glob on social media where
everybody is the same everybody is told to respond like little mice to this algorithm to this
algorithm and that we're turning into something that's not human yeah so um i'll shut up but that's
sort of my answer we'll take we'll take your soapbox away now no i i i sympathize with this a
lot it's interesting early in my career my career kind of began around the confluence of positive
psychology there was this whole movement in the 2000s of positive psychology where a lot of
psychologists felt like they were able to quantify happiness and and deduce exactly which practices
led you to to to be happier and feel more fulfilled in your life and you know i was young
i was naive i bought fully into it hook line and sinker i wrote tons of articles around
positive psychology research and everything and it's been interesting because over the past
10 years or so something like 80 of those studies don't replicate like they don't like they're
they're insufficient sample sizes they they can't be reproduced in other studies and so it we're we're
kind of back to square one of like oh actually we don't know what makes us happy and we don't know
how much willpower we have and we don't know uh how much motivation is external versus internal and like
it's it's given me a much deeper more profound uh appreciation for the timeless things yeah you
know the that the simple principles whether it's the stoics or the buddhists uh or the christians like
if it's been around for 2000 years there's probably something to it and so we should maybe put a little
bit more well i mean if you think about i tell people this all the time if you think about 2000 if you
only go back 200 years ago um i like to go back to the world of the writer jane austen in like the
1810s you have no internet you have no television you have no radio you have no your only form of
entertainment is people so you're constantly interacting with people day in and day out that's
your only salvation it's the only thing you have to distract you from the misery of your life
right so people become these incredible observers right and then they write about it i'm not saying
everybody but the the great philosophers the thinkers the writers the novelists they're so keyed into
people and who they are that they see things that we're no longer capable of seeing because we're so
disoriented right yeah we're not human as i said we're not so human anymore so that's why someone like
plato or socrates could have this timeless wisdom because they're wandering around within their sandals
and togas just constantly interacting with other people thinking about issues that we don't think
about anymore because we take everything for granted we've lost our sense of wonder so yeah i'm
look i studied classics greek and ancient greek and latin that's my world i find when i read something
from that time i feel like i'm traveling to another planet i'm so amazed i'm so astounded by what
their insights what they're saying what they're talking about humans about our senses about what
it just means to be alive so god i'm losing track of what our question is science versus philosophy
science versus wisdom data versus wisdom it sounds like we're all team wisdom yeah but going back to
what you said about we need more individuals i think i found this in myself when i was i studied
psychology i studied i was in academia for a little while too and so i got very much i was like
yes everything should be data driven and for the longest time you know for instance mark
mentioned willpower how much willpower do we have well we thought this was this little finite
resource that we had to like parcel out and distribute throughout our lives in strategic ways well
it turns out if you believe that you don't have a lot of willpower you probably don't and i see this
over and over and over again i'm going down the laundry list of things that i've believed for so
long you know extrinsic and intrinsic motivation that could be complete too i'm externally motivated
by a lot of things is that such a bad thing no it's not it reminds me there's so much like
recursive stuff in psychology it reminds me of a there's a great one-liner from the comedian emo
phillips where he said uh he said uh i used to think the brain was the most amazing thing in the
universe then i then i remembered who was telling me that yeah yeah yeah oh but i mean 100 years ago
there was this more than 100 years this man named william james a psychologist oh yes big fans he wrote
things about willpower that blow all this in our culture now out of the water he nailed it perfectly
if you want to understand will and the power that you have through your willpower go read william
james and throw all those studies out yeah yeah i would agree with that here here what else do we
got yes we do have some more questions so these came in uh we asked asked people to ask you questions
yeah um one of them will kind of get back to the true self one what is your recommended process to
get back to one's true self after getting lost exhausted and cynical and mid-life 40 laws came out
when you were like 38 or nine right you were 39 yeah so you were older we have a lot of people like
i'm 35 my life is over what do i do i felt that way pretty much too when i was 35. well um you know
as i said everyone's different and i don't know where this person comes from but hopefully in that
period up until your age of 35 you have done something with your life you have learned some skills
you have followed some kind of career path it just wasn't the right one okay but you can't just junk
all of that and suddenly start over you have to build from what you already have right it's kind of
an organic process you can't just suddenly start with from a blank slate and say i'm going to go
completely redraw the course of my life you're setting yourself up for misery because it's not how
world works you have a brain it has developed certain things it has functioned in a certain
way and it has accumulated some level of skill so where can we apply that skill that fits you better
so when you're 22 23 that process that you we went through earlier on it fits more but now you're 35
you're 36 it's a it's a different process and if you're 50 it's even more different process if you're
70 i don't think there is any process anymore i think it's over but um i try to see in the in the
seeds of who you are at the 35 year old where it went wrong and so i like to go back to people and
sort of go back where they felt like they made a wrong turn and often where they made a wrong turn was
they decided on a career either because it was money and they needed the money or because people told
them that this is what they should go into right like your parents yeah a lot of people who end
up becoming lawyers i don't mean to pick on lawyers because we need lawyers obviously but they go into
law school for that purpose to make money and then they kind of burn out because law uh certain kinds
of law just just are so repetitive and there's no and after you turn 35 i'm trapped in this thing it's
so bored so turned out so we got to go back and figure out where you made your wrong turn and
often it's because you listen to someone else or you grab for money all right so you grab for money
because you're anxious you feel like you you don't know if you're going to make it in this world you
need that you need to eat and you're worried about your future and your career okay so if you're 35 and you
made a wrong turn and you still have that anxiety about making money we have to prescribe something
that fits you i don't like telling people to do things that are going to ruin they're going to make
them miserable or that can potentially really screw up their future i'm very sensitive to that so if
money is very important to you we have to take that path that you're on we have to deviate it a
little bit in a slightly different direction and i talk to people about that and we've we go back into
their childhood we go back into things that indicate more of where they would like to be
and even if you're like flipping burgers at in and out there's going to be some other path slightly
different from that that will still be better than where you are right now okay so if the money thing
isn't so important if you're not so anxious then we have a little bit more latitude to explore and go
into something that deviation does have to be like this it could be maybe more like that but it can't
be like this yeah okay so um everything depends on who you are your psychology and your level of anxiety
plays a very important role in this because making these changes can be very frightening
i once had some some guy who was in his mid-20s who was basically trapped at a terrible job kind of
like a a fast food type job and i was very sensitive he had a fan he had a wife and some kids
and i said all right um we figured out what he really wanted what he was really excited about which
was great because otherwise you never do figure that out and i said don't quit your job but i want you to
start studying this new field on the internet absorbing it at night in the one or two hours
that you have free and then i want you to go to night school and spend maybe work four days a week
and spend some time there you still can pay your bills and go to night school he said just the thought
of doing that made him feel a thousand times better that there was some kind of hope that there was a
path yeah right so you've got to be i've got to work with the individual and what where they are
you know and and and deal with the anxiety about making a living yeah totally i i one thing for
sure is i think people definitely underestimate how much a small shift i think it's when they feel
emotionally overwhelmed because the emotion is so all-encompassing they assume that they just have to
throw everything out and start over from scratch whereas it's like if you just shift a couple things
in the right direction it's like dominoes it knocks it it has like a reverberating effect across your life
it was really interesting though we ran a survey maybe three or four months ago on our audience and
one of the questions we asked purely out of curiosity was just what are you struggling with right now like
what is your the biggest struggle in your life and it was very interesting among the middle-aged cohort
uh say people in their 40s and 50s one of the most common responses was people saying uh i have a great
career i've got a great family great spouse is this it i kind of want to just disappear and go to tahiti and
start over like they they they kind of had a little bit of this midlife this can't be it right like there
has to be more and uh almost like a little bit of a panic that that went on and i'm curious what you
what your thoughts with somebody like that would be well my thought is for those of you out there who
are in your 20s do not get to that point damn it don't ever let that happen to you because it will
happen to you and it's terrible yeah it's tragic yeah right so don't let that happen yeah figure it
out before then but some of it is like unrealistic yeah i mean if you're in your mid 40s and you've got
all these things that you said maybe you have to find maybe you have to kind of accept it and find
some beauty in it now this will sound completely irrelevant and off track here but six years ago
i suffered a stroke right and prior to that stroke i was somebody that swam every third day rode a
mountain bike up into the hills and hiked and other things i was just very active because it was my main
main way of detressing overnight all of that is taken away from me right i can't walk i can't hike
i can't swim i can't take even a simple walk i'm not trying to get pity but i'm saying you know it's
it i had to go through i had to adapt yeah and what i had to do is i meditate every day and i had to go
through this process and i'm writing a book right now and i had to find what is beautiful without
being cliched or or pollyannish about it what is beautiful about my life as it is these are my
circumstances this is you know what if i was punished or whatever happened it happened it's just who i am
now i am this person who can't walk that's who i am but i'm still able to think i'm still able to write
books i'm still able to find beauty in my limited world yes i wish i was an athlete yes i wish i could
do the things i did before but that doesn't help me at all yeah so my advice to someone maybe in that
area is become a little more zen and find a little bit more of the beauty in your life as it is and
don't be thinking there's some golden ring out there that at 45 48 some hot model that you can run off
to with to tahiti and start over and you know have new you know also the peter pan syndrome
there's definitely there's a connection there for sure uh you you could almost say i like a
to a certain degree maturity is the the acceptance of your own limitedness i think yeah you know i
mean you can get too accepting yeah that's true you know complacent which is different yeah yeah um
no we've talked about a lot about that though i think there's a gratitude piece in that where
acknowledging just your existence is a miracle first of all yeah and i've leaned the older i get
the more this the simple things around me are very much like this is amazing there there's literally
that's gonna sound like i'm gloating but there are literally days where i'm like i'm one of the
luckiest people on the planet if you are the luckiest person on the planet you are yeah so that's the
subject of my new book by the way oh it is okay oh we outed you okay yeah good luck or gratitude no
neither um it's about drew bernie yes exactly that would be shocking the biography the unauthorized
biography of drew everybody everybody would be shocked by that no uh it's it's a book about the
sublime ah yeah that's it that's the word i want nice yeah so um you know i'm trying to say
i have a chapter called um awaken to the strangeness of being alive
and so like being alive is a very strange thing that's so weird you know it's so weird
to think that in this vast universe there's life here on this one tiny little
little tiny little thing in this vast ocean of darkness and we're here and do you know the chances
of your parents ever coming together and reproducing each room you can never calculate it it's impossible
because you know your parents met on some quirk of fate right and they may have never met multiply
that by 70 80 000 all the generations that went prior to them meeting yes maybe a tiny little part of
you might have been born if that had gone off 70 000 years ago differently but it wouldn't be you at
all who you are is is the strangest thing you could possibly think of so it's a book about triggering
those kinds of thoughts and people about everything around them because for me writing that book is
like live or die if i don't start thinking like that i'm just going to get so goddamn depressed i'll
kill myself i have to think about these things you know well there were there were several questions
uh people asking when is the next book coming out so when is that book coming out
every author's favorite question the worst question ever you know you know
like people want to know though
sounds like you're in the midst of the throes of writing it so yeah there are 12 chapters i'm on
chapter 10. okay okay okay and uh i was hoping it would be out next year but i won't i'm not getting
my act together so 2026. okay it'll be out in two years okay if i don't die before then but if i die
they'll still be able to get the book out because i have enough of it out finished so
well we'll look forward to it we'll have to have you back we'll uh sit and bask in the miracle of
life together yeah i'm really looking forward to that one yeah yeah yeah it's it's um it's a weird
book it's like uh my wife says it's kind of like taking drugs without drugs yes it's funny because when
we were sitting here talking about how weird life was i was like man we sound like a bunch of stone kids
in a college dorm isn't it so weird we're alive that's the kind of thing that you yeah i know i
remember seeing that totally smoking some pot yeah yeah we did not drop any acid for this episode
yeah there was this was a sober episode yeah maybe we should maybe next time that's the next one
all right thank you so much robert thank you mark i really enjoyed it it was a ton of great time thank
