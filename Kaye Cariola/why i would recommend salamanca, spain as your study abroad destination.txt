Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. My name is Kay, and today I'm going to be talking
to you about the seven reasons why I would recommend Salamanca, Spain, as your study
abroad destination. So I studied abroad in Salamanca the summer of 2018, and I went with
ISA, otherwise known as International Studies Abroad, and through them I took a five-week
summer intensive course in which I was able to study at the University of Salamanca. I
took four courses and was able to transfer the credit that I earned from there back to
my home university towards my degree. And overall, my study abroad experience highly exceeded
my expectations. If you're thinking about studying abroad anywhere in the world, I would
just highly recommend it because it's just a positive experience where you learn a lot,
you have fun, you meet new people, and it's just an entirely different experience that's
outside of your comfort zone and that if you give it a chance that you can learn a lot
from and grow a lot from. So I'm going to get into the reasons why I would recommend Salamanca
as your destination. Salamanca is an ideal place to practice speaking Spanish, and Salamanca
is often referred to as La Ciudad del Espa√±ol, which is the city for learning Spanish. And
a lot of international students come to Salamanca to learn Spanish and along with their other
studies. And from what I gather, El Castellano Castilian Spanish is the kind of standard
Spanish that's most widely spoken and that has spread around the world. So the Spanish
that you hear in other countries, it most resembles Castilian Spanish, is what I gathered
from that. And during my time there, I tried to speak as much Spanish as possible with
my host family, with my university professors, and just when you're out in the street in
your daily life. And in my experience, the majority of people are really helpful and
encouraging when you want to practice speaking Spanish for them. I haven't had any instances
where someone will speak English to me when I'm trying to speak Spanish to them, which
I know can happen a lot in different places around the world. But yeah, usually people
are really patient and if you try to speak whatever you know, then they'll usually just
be really understanding and respond back to you nicely. And I think what's most important
is that you try and be sincere about it and people will generally respond positively.
And you don't have to be a completely fluent Spanish speaker to come study in Salamanca
because there are different universities that offer various levels of courses from beginning
to superior. So whether you know a little bit of Spanish or you know a lot of Spanish
or if you're fluent, then you can come and just continue your studies here. The second
reason is that Universidad de Salamanca, the University of Salamanca, is one of the top
universities in the world. It is the oldest in Spain and one of the most prestigious
universities in the world. And overall, I'd say the education that I got there was really
good. For my Spanish language and culture curriculum, I took four courses. So I took
Spanish language, Spanish history, Spanish literature, and Spanish art. I found that
all my professors were just very interested and passionate about what they were teaching.
I feel like my Spanish language course was the one that I learned the most in because
we were taught practical information that you could use outside in the real world. So
our professor taught us stuff like how to order a pinto at a bar or to ask how much
something costs to the grocery store or ask where the bus station is and just stuff like
that. I would say overall that the courses aren't extremely difficult. I feel like as
long as you put effort in, you participate and you listen, then you're going to pass
with a high grade. And the third reason why I would recommend Salamanca is because it's
beautiful there. It has so many incredibly picturesque places. So many of the major sites
are really beautiful, but there are also some, I feel like lesser known, hidden places that
are also equally as beautiful. Whenever I would go out and explore the city, whether
it was alone or with my friends, we just found these really beautiful places. And a lot of
them were free to go to and just visit. And living there for a time just really made me
inspired and appreciative of the scenery that I was able to see every day. And the fourth
reason why I would recommend Salamanca to study abroad in is because it's a student-friendly
city. Because of the Universidad de Salamanca and other universities in the city, there's
a lot of young people there. There's a lot of people studying abroad as well. So you
find a lot of young people. The city has a really young vibe. There's lots of bars, cafes,
like just lots of places to hang out and where you see a lot of people just hanging out together.
And one thing you'll always hear about Salamanca from your advisors or your professors is that
the city is completely walkable. And it is. Also, the city is student-budget-friendly.
It's really cheap to go out for a pinchot or a tapa or get a drink either in between
your classes or during the afternoon when you want to hang out with some friends or grab
a snack or anything. Usually for a small plate of food or a pastry or something, it's usually
less than five euros. And if you get a drink that's usually like three or four. In between
my morning classes, I had a 30-minute break, so I would always stop at the same cafe and
get a fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little pastry just for a little something before
the rest of my classes during the day. And it was always cheap too. And another good
reason to study abroad in Salamanca is because Salamanca is safe. I was constantly reassured
by my professors and my ISA directors that it's a very safe city, especially for young
people to be in. You always see people walking out in the streets. The main areas are always
well lit. You see a lot of people going out either to eat or going out to the club or
the bar. And people are generally just friendly or if you mind your own business, then you're
not bothered. Whenever I went out to explore the city, I was usually out during the daytime
or I was with a group of friends. And if I went out at night, then I wasn't alone. And
there are taxis that are always available to take you home if you feel like you need
it. And in my experience, I never had any encounters where I felt unsafe. But with that
being said, it's always a smart idea to be aware of your surroundings, to be with your
friends or other people when you can. Trust your gut feeling if something doesn't feel
right. And if you can, just have a backup plan. So just in case you're in a situation
you don't want to be in, then you're taken care of.
Salamanca has lots of activities, things to do, and events that are usually really inexpensive
or they are free. When I was there, there were a couple of different events that were
being held like the feast day of San Juan de Sao Un, which is Salamanca's patron saint.
And they have a fireworks show that's over the Rio Tormes, the Tormes River. Yeah, just
a really special occasion to go out and celebrate something local. And another really cool exhibition
was the Festival de Luz y Van Guardias, which was an art festival featuring lights, projections,
and installations that were exhibited on some of Salamanca's most famous buildings. It was
just really cool. There are plenty of places to sightsee. There's lots of historical buildings,
museums, cultural places, places of religious significance, and lots of places to learn about
Salamanca's history and culture. I will leave a link in the description below to my blog post
that has a list of recommendations for free things to do, things to go see that you can go to for
like a small fee. And these places usually have student discounts, so that's even cheaper. Yeah,
just a list of recommendations I would suggest to people going to go visit. And the last reason
I would recommend Salamanca as your study abroad destination is because it's a great place to
make friends and meet new people. The city has a very young vibe and there are lots of events
and activities and opportunities to meet new people and to find others to share your study
abroad experience with. If you're going with a study abroad program like ISA, then you already
have a group of people that you can connect with even before you get to the city. Obviously,
you'll meet people through your classes. There are organized events that the university will hold
or your study abroad program will hold to either meet with locals or just like cultural classes
that you can take together. And I think like experiences like these are really important to
just put yourself out there and to like just participate in because it'll make your experience
that much more enjoyable and language exchange programs are fantastic because you get the opportunity
to practice speaking Spanish usually with locals. You can meet people that are from the city or
from Spain or from like even like different places around the world and just practice speaking
your Spanish together. And you also get to know each other and make friends and that's also a good
thing too. And most of the people I met usually is just really nice and just fun to be around and
always up for an adventure or chilling or just spending some time together. And those are my
top reasons why I would recommend Salamanca Spain as your study abroad destination. Let me know in
