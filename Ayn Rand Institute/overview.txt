Checking Ayn Rand Institute/David Hume： Causality, Induction, and the Subjectivity of Ethics by Leonard Peikoff, part 40 of 50.txt
1. **Causality and Instinct**: David Hume, despite his skepticism about causality, relies on instinct and natural tendencies in his own behavior, such as avoiding placing his hand in fire repeatedly based on past experience. This inconsistency arises because Hume, like all humans, cannot entirely escape the instinctual belief in causality that he criticizes.

2. **Innate Ideas**: Hume's position shifts slightly from his initial claim that there are no innate ideas. He acknowledges that certain feelings and emotions are part of our empirical equipment and are directly given to us, much like simple ideas. These emotions are not explained by Hume as deriving from reason or intellect but are accepted as irreducible elements of human experience.

3. **Sensation vs. Conception**: Some philosophers favored sensations and perceptions over concepts because they were tangible and directly experienced, whereas concepts, being abstract and non-perceivable in the same way, were considered less real or meaningful. This preference reflects a nominalist perspective where direct perception of reality is privileged over abstract conceptualization.

4. **Philosophy of Concepts**: The challenge with concepts lies in their intangible nature, which makes them more difficult to grasp than percepts. Philosophers who emphasized sensations and perceptions may have done so because they were easier to understand and seemed more directly connected to reality. However, this preference does not necessarily validate the conclusions drawn by these philosophers, as it reflects a deeper issue with the theory of concepts at the heart of philosophy.

In summary, Hume's skepticism about causality and his denial of innate ideas are complicated by his acceptance of natural instincts. The philosophical preference for sensation and perception over conceptualization is rooted in the belief that sensory experiences are more directly connected to reality, but this preference does not resolve the philosophical complexities surrounding concepts.

Checking Ayn Rand Institute/The Student Rebellion at Columbia： Ayn Rand's Full Broadcast.txt
 Ayn Rand discusses the student rebellion at Colombia University in 1965, which she views as an attempt by a minority of violent students to impose their will through force, rather than through reasoned debate or democratic processes. She expresses concern that the situation could lead to the acceptance of force as a legitimate means of political action and the undermining of individual rights and freedom. In her analysis, published in her newsletter and later in "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal," she warns that the student rebellion is not just an isolated incident but a trial balloon for statist and collectivist groups aiming to destroy the remaining elements of freedom and capitalism in America.

Rand points out that the universities, as centers of knowledge and reason, should be upholding these values but are instead being used to test the waters for a potential takeover by force. She emphasizes the importance of the American public recognizing this trend and standing against it to preserve individual rights and prevent the country from succumbing to the same fate as those in Europe under totalitarian regimes.

She also reflects on her earlier analysis of the Berkeley student rebellion in 1965, drawing parallels between the two events and emphasizing her prediction that such incidents were the precursors to a larger campaign against freedom and capitalism. Rand calls upon intellectuals and the general public to take note of these developments and act to prevent the erosion of individual rights and the potential for violence and dictatorship in America.

Checking Ayn Rand Institute/Why Do Philosophers Keep Getting Ayn Rand Wrong？.txt
 In this episode, the hosts discuss the common phenomenon where individuals, particularly those introduced to philosophy through Ayn Rand's works, might engage with her ideas without delving into the original texts of the philosophers she references or criticizes. This can lead to a superficial understanding that mirrors the same error critics make when they misrepresent Rand's philosophy.

To illustrate, one host shares how INRAND (Ayn Rand's works) often serves as an introduction to philosophy for many, including herself. While INRAND provides a gateway to the subject, it can also lead some to discuss or critique philosophers like Kant without having read their work firsthand. This is comparable to the irritation that Kant scholars might feel when their work is misrepresented by those who have only engaged with INRAND's take on Kant.

The hosts suggest a self-check for anyone making arguments or critiques: consider how you would react if someone presented their understanding of your position based solely on a secondary source, and strive to avoid that pitfall. The goal is to engage with philosophy directly and critically, not just through the lens of INRAND.

The episode also mentions resources for those interested in delving deeper into Ayn Rand's philosophy, including an article by Mike Munger titled "Why can't professional philosophers get RAND right?" and another article by Massimo Pigliucci on similar topics. Additionally, a companion to INRAND edited by Gregory Salmieri is recommended, with chapter one by the same author being particularly relevant for understanding how to approach Rand's work as an outsider.

Listeners are encouraged to engage with the content by subscribing to the podcast, following on social media, and sending questions or comments to experts at RAND.org. The hosts invite feedback and suggestions for future episodes and remind viewers that direct engagement with primary texts is key to a deeper understanding of philosophy.
