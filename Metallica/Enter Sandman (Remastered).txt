See your prayers, it's a long don't forget my son to include everyone
I'll tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin till the sanity comes
Sling with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
Exit light, enter night, take my hand, rock to never never land
Something's wrong, shut the light, have you thought through the night and the honest are white
Dreams of war, dreams of lies, dreams of dragons, fire and the things that will bang
Sling with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
Exit light, enter night, take my hand, rock to never never land
Sling with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
Now I'm leaving down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to take a still baby
Don't say a word, it never my land or you heard, it's just the peace under your bed in your closet in your hair
Exit light, enter night, great of sin, Exit light, enter night, take my hand, rock to never never land
Today, yeah, oh, oh
Sling with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight
Exit light, enter night, take my hand, rock to never never land
Thank you for watching!
