Checking Andrew M. Davis/Axiological Asymmetry and the Reason for Being ï½œ Andrew M. Davis.txt
1. The cosmos is not centered around humans; rather, humans are part of a cosmic whole (anthropocosmic perspective).
   
2. The cosmos communicates value through human experiences, suggesting that value is intrinsic to the universe.

3. Within the spectrum or hierarchy of values, certain higher values dominate and include others, while lower values are exclusive and do not hold as much weight.

4. The hierarchy of values implies an asymmetrical relationship where higher values encompass and give meaning to lower values.

5. The purpose or meaning of the world and life itself is to respond to and realize the positive value that inherently exists, which grounds our being.

6. There is a challenge to move beyond merely understanding these ideas propositionally to adopting a dispositional orientation towards the world, one that is transparent to transcendent values and reflects an awareness of the deeper purpose and meaning of existence.

7. By developing this attitudinal axiology, humans can align themselves with the values that ground their being and find a deeper sense of identity and purpose.

In essence, the discussion invites us to consider the possibility that the universe has evolved for life because it is inherently valuable, and that our role as conscious beings is to recognize, respond to, and actualize this value, thereby fulfilling the meaning and purpose of existence. This perspective shifts our understanding of why there is something rather than nothing, from a purely material or empirical explanation to one that includes intrinsic value and ethical requirements as fundamental aspects of reality.
