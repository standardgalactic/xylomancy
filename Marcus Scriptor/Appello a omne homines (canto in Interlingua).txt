We have different opinions, we have different religions,
If you want to survive, you have to learn
Learn how to tolerate, to surround and to love
Not only the environment must be and now, now to love them
The entire humanity is a single family
Every nationality, every heart, every daughter
Join us, travel, look for them
I believe they will create a world without wars
The entire humanity is a single family
Every nationality, every heart, every daughter
Join us, travel, look for them
I believe they will create a world without wars
The entire humanity is a single family
Now we live in America, now we live in Australia, Europe and Asia
We have different opinions, we have different religions,
If you want to survive, you have to learn
Learn how to tolerate, to surround and to love
Not only the environment must be and now, now to love them
