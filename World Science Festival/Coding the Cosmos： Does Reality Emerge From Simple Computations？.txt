Hi, everyone. Welcome to this live discussion brought to you by the World Science Festival.
I'm Brian Green. I am coming to you live from my office in the physics department at Columbia
University, the Center for Theoretical Physics. And our discussion today will be with Stephen
Wolfram, a name that many of you are quite familiar with from so many contributions from
Mathematica, which has had such a profound influence on the kinds of science that
we are able to undertake, Wolfram Alpha, the Wolfram Language. Of course, Stephen is a physicist
at heart. That's where his initial training began. And our conversation will focus on some of the
work that he's been doing recently in trying to give us a perhaps different way of thinking about
the fundamental laws. And before I bring Stephen on, I just want to quickly say, look, you know,
those of you who have followed physics and science more generally, perhaps through World
Science Festival events or books, your own studying, look, you know that our goal, which really was
articulated perhaps most succinctly by Albert Einstein, is trying to figure out the fundamental
laws of the universe. As Einstein said, did God have any choice in the creation of the universe?
And he wasn't talking about God in any conventional sense. What Einstein meant was,
is there any freedom in the way the laws of the universe are constructed in the form that they
take? Or is there some principle that we're still struggling to find that would lead us
ineluctably, inevitably, to a unique description of physical reality? And that's an important
question because look, we have developed over the course of the 20th century, the 21st century,
general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, far more speculative,
of course, but I can't help but throw it into the mix. And as we go ever deeper toward grasping the
fundamental laws of fundamental mathematical equations in the way that we typically frame those
laws, there are two questions that come to the fore. Number one, have we got the fundamental
laws? Of course, that's vital. And we all agree that that's an ongoing search, an ongoing process.
No one would say that today's laws are the laws. But even if sometime in the future we do have those
fundamental laws, a key question will be why those laws are not some other laws? And if we can show
that there's a unique set of laws that meets some very basic set of criteria, and that would
certainly help answer that question, or perhaps we'll be forced to go the other direction and say,
well, it's not why this law instead of that law, perhaps all possible laws in some sense
are out there. And we as particular observers of the world only have access to or only are aware
of a certain slice of reality that's well described by the particular laws that we have
developed. That's a possible direction that this all will go. And Stephen Wolfram has been developing
ideas, which perhaps is fair to say, intertwine and thread through all of those interesting
scientific and philosophical ideas. And our goal today will be to tease out exactly where
Stephen Wolfram's program is at the moment and where it might be heading. So with that,
let me bring in Stephen Wolfram. Hey, Stephen, how are you doing?
Just fine. Great to see you. Nice to see you too.
And where are you at the moment physically? Concord, Massachusetts.
Are you home? Yeah. Excellent. I've been a work from home guy for
three years, long before it was fashionable. Speaking of that, I just do have a quick question,
completely irrelevant for our conversation, but somebody asked me the other day, and I did not
know the answer to it, across all of your endeavors, Wolfram Research, Mathematica, and
how many people work with you? I mean, what's your grand total employee base?
Yeah, it's about 800 people. It's a fairly small operation. And my basic principle has been
automate as much as possible. So over the years, what we can do with just 800 people
is lots of leverage from lots of automation. I built the tools we've been developing for so
long, partly because I wanted to use them myself. And turns out, I've managed to alternate between
doing basic science and building technology out five times in my life so far. And it's pretty
neat because you build a bunch of science, you see what tools can be built, you build the tools,
then that lets you build another level of science and example of things. Things I've been doing
recently in physics, they are the result of multiple rounds of this kind of science, technology,
iteration, so to speak. Would it be fair to say when it comes to early on in your career, and again,
maybe I'm not framing it in the way that you was? So please feel free to correct. But would you say
that your goal at some point was to drill down in computation and find the fundamental
ingredients that underlie all computation in some universal manner that would allow you to
create a system like Mathematica that would be widely applicable because it wasn't stuck on any
particular computational framework, but rather was the the ur, the basis of all computation.
Yeah, I mean, what I thought I was doing at the time when I did it is not what I've understood I
was doing decades later, but projecting backwards. When I had done physics, when I was a teenager and
so on, and particle physics and cosmology and things like that. And one of the things that is
always a challenge there is doing the calculations and I had wanted to automate that. And then
sometimes around the end of 1979, so ancient times, I kind of was like, I want to make it as
automatic as possible to do the kinds of computations that I and other people want to do. And the
question was how do you do that? And I guess from my life in natural science, kind of the obvious
thing to do was try and find the primitives, the underlying sort of atomic elements of computation.
But what I mean, projecting backwards, so to speak, one of the things that's a challenge is
what is computationally possible is vastly broader than what we humans care about.
So what, you know, first step is how do you represent what is computationally possible?
That's actually rather easy. Much more challenging is to build the bridge from the way that we think
about things to the what's computationally possible. And that's been kind of my lifetime
activity of sort of building a computational language, a notation for computation that is
convenient for us humans, and that can tap into this kind of reservoir of power in the
computational universe. And that's been so that will be my kind of way in modern times of explaining
what what I've been doing for the last 40 something years. Yeah, for sure. You know, I think many
people who are watching this or will watch this subsequently, they have made use of the tools
that you have built, but perhaps for the one or two in the audience that perhaps have not. Let me
just note, you know, from a personal perspective, it's not just that the tools that you have provided,
I'm speaking of Mathematica in particular, allows us to do things more easily. It allows us to do
computations that we would not have the boldness to even contemplate doing without having the tool
in place. And I'm thinking specifically years ago, when I was doing work in string theory that was
trying to use something that I thankfully played a role in developing called mirror symmetry to
calculate what were known as a number of rational curves on certain Calabi al manifolds, right?
The calculations, we could set them up, but without a tool like Mathematica, it would be
virtually impossible to actually carry forward with them. But you know, with what you had,
we could set it up and hit a button and sit back and the machine would just spit out number after
number after number, calculating exactly what we were seeking. So yeah, yeah. But the beautiful thing
is what you're willing to attempt to undertake can be profoundly impacted by the tools at your
disposal. It's a very nonlinear process between the two. Yeah. I mean, the way I see what I'm
trying to do is to give people a way to think computationally about things. It's kind of like
the analog in mathematics was before kind of 500 years ago or something, when you wanted to talk
about mathematics, you just be using words and natural language. And then people started inventing
mathematical notation and plus signs and equal signs and things. And then it all got very streamlined.
And you could start to actually, you could have a mathematical language in which to think
mathematically. And that's, you know, got algebra and calculus and then all the mathematical
sciences and so on. And, you know, kind of what I see as our mission is to provide that kind of
computational notation, that kind of computational language, the thinking about things computationally.
And I think the thing that when we say, what does it mean to think computationally about things?
It's kind of like we define rules for how things work. And then we see the consequences of those
rules. And that's a very general kind of activity. And the question of sort of what types of rules
are ones that, for example, relate to the kinds of things that we humans care about.
That's kind of the art of designing a computational language is to be able to represent those kinds
of things. But do you imagine, and we'll get into this when we turn to physics in just a moment,
but just speaking more generally, you know, at some point, we have some conversation with some
extraterrestrial civilization. And we ask them about, you know, how do you go about trying to
quantify or to think more deeply about the nature of the challenges that reality presents you? Will
they do you think have the same computational basis as we do? Or is it just a quirk of our
evolutionary process that we think about the world in a particular way? And that gives us one
slice through the computational universe? Yeah, I mean, this is a this is a bigger conversation.
But I think this this whole kind of idea about, you know, can you think about the world being
built from rules? I think that's a very general idea. I think that the way in which you package
those rules and the way that you kind of perceive and think in terms of those rules, that's pretty
specific. And so my my tendency is to say, for example, you say, well, we talk about the extraterrestrials,
you know, the alien intelligences and so on. My feeling is, there are alien intelligences all
around us, you know, the weather famously is supposed to have a mind of its own. And I think
in many real senses, it does. It's just that that mind is not well aligned with the kind of mind
that we have. If we look at, you know, the neuron firings in our brains, they're following physical
laws, they're doing what they do. If you look at the fluid dynamics in the atmosphere, it's
following physical laws, it's doing what it does. And the question is, can we say that the stuff going
on in our brains is in some fundamental sense more sophisticated than what's going on in the
atmosphere? I don't think so. I think the issue is that what's going on in our brains is kind of
our perception of kind of this this notion of intelligence, it's aligned in a particular
direction. It's different from the alignment of, you know, the fluid dynamics in the atmosphere
or whatever else. So I tend to think that this question of you ask, sort of, will the aliens,
so to speak, have the same view of computation? I think at the lowest level, it's kind of things
are operating according to rules. If you ask kind of how would what is the internal narrative of the
aliens, the internal narrative of the weather, the internal narrative for our brains, those are
different. And, you know, this is the sort of the essence of what we do when we do science,
is we try and take the natural world as it is out there, and we try and kind of
put it into a narrative that we humans can understand. I mean, that's what when we say
we're making a theory for something, you know, the thing out there is just doing what it does.
The question is, do we have a way with it within our minds, within our way of thinking about things
to kind of talk about what it's doing, so to speak? Along those lines, I can't help. And I hope
that you're willing to sit for a little while, because I'd like to pursue this just for a moment
and then get to the real topic of our conversation here, because I don't think they're separate,
actually. I think there's a deep connection between it all. But you talk about the internal
representation or the internal experience. And I think that is, for most people, what distinguishes
our kind of computation from the computation of the weather, right? I don't think most people,
I mean, Thomas Nagel had this famous dictum that if you're wanting to describe consciousness,
you should ask the question, what is it like to be that thing? You know, what is it like to be a
human? We have a reasonable good understanding of that, because we are of that category. What is
it like to be a bat, right? Does a bat have an inner world of consciousness? And we can certainly
imagine that the answer to that question is yes, even though it's very difficult to put ourselves
into the mind of a bat. But when it comes to the weather, I think most people would resist
the idea that there is a what it is like to be the weather. Do you think there is a what it is
like to be the weather? Yes. I mean, I think that, you know, if we look at all any of us ever know
is our own personal internal experiences, even the extrapolation to, you know, another human's
experiences, very tough, is just an, you know, empathetic extrapolation. And by the way, when
you are imagining what a human with a different coming from a different time in history or with
a different kind of set of educational cultural backgrounds and so on is, it's not completely
trivial to take your inner thinking patterns and project them. And, you know, if you start thinking
about, you know, what's it like to be a computer, you know, you start thinking about what is the
experience of a computer from the time it's booted up to the time it crashes, kind of like a human
lifespan. It remembers certain things, it has certain experiences, maybe somebody, you know,
plugs a peripheral into some portnet has some horrible trauma, all kinds of all kinds of things
like this. It is as you trace it through, it is surprisingly and bizarrely similar in external
description, the kind of thing that that we feel. And I think it's it's one of these things where
this question of, for example, you talk about laws of physics, and there's this question of
we are projecting what is actually happening out there in the world into our particular kind of
internal representation of what's going on. And, you know, you were talking about sort of the
inevitability or not of the laws of physics. One of the things that's been a huge surprise to me in
the last couple of years, is that from what I can tell, there is in some sense, a complete
inevitability of the core laws of 20th century physics for observers like us. In other words,
if if we were not as we are, if we had different characteristics, we would believe that the world
has laws different from the ones that we believe that it has. But the thing that's been a big
surprise to me is that it turns out that the you know, you might say, well, does it depend on the
fact that we have two eyes? Does it depend on this? Does it depend on that? It depends on
sort of two very big things and one subsidiary thing. It depends on the fact that we are
computationally bounded observers of the universe. That is, there's all this computation going on
in the universe, but to stuff it into our finite minds, we need to sort of simplify it a lot.
That's one thing. The other thing that is, is that we believe we are persistent in time. That is,
even in, you know, we'll talk about in actual models of physics, we are in, you know, our models
were made of different atoms of space at every moment in time. Yet, we believe that we have the
single thread of experience going through time. And there's a third thing, actually,
which is we're a certain size relative to the underlying stuff in the universe.
For sure.
You know, we're not and the fact that, for example, to give an example sort of close to the kinds of
things I think you've thought about a long time, you know, our notion of time and space depends a
lot on how big we are. That is, the fact that, you know, we look around and we see, you know,
10, 100 meters away. And light comes to us from that distance. Speed of light is pretty fast.
And that means that, you know, in a microsecond, a millionth of a second, we'll have seen what's
around us. Our brains process things on more like thousandth of a second time scales. So,
for us, we see the world as a series of kind of frames of this is what space is like.
We say it's out there because we see it sort of all at the same time.
Right. If we were, for example, if we thought a million times faster, replace our brain hardware
with digital electronics, we'll think a million times faster, we would have a different point of
view. Because then, you know, the scene that we're in, if we were in the same size scene,
it would be coming to us in time short compared to the time it takes us to process it.
We think of space more like time, presumably.
Yes. Yeah. Yes. I mean, it's a, so I mean, there are these aspects of kind of the way we are as
observers that cause us to perceive the world the way we perceive the world. The big surprise to me
has been the very technical fact that the big laws of 20th century physics, statistical mechanics,
technical thermodynamics, you know, general relativity and quantum mechanics,
seem so far as we can tell to be not optional. They are inevitable features of observers like us.
This is what observers like us will have to see as they sort of try to understand what's out there
in the world, which is to me remarkable. I mean, we'll talk about this maybe more, but you know,
this idea that it is conceivable to not just wheel in the laws of physics as a, oh, it happens to
be that way, but to be able to say that at least for observers like us, the laws of physics as we
have discovered them are inevitable. Along those lines though, and again, we will get into some
of the details, but to characterize the phrase observers like us, you've made reference to a
few qualities. Yes. You've made reference to computationally bounded. You've made reference
to the time scales over which we process information, say being very slow compared to, say, the speed of
light. That, those feel very general to me. It's almost hard for me to imagine a non-computationally
bounded observer. I'm not sure what that observer, now you'd say this of course is a limitation of
the fact that I am a computationally bounded observer, I presume, but do you envision what
a non-computationally bounded observer would be? Well, I mean, it's the universe.
No, I'll give you an example. So, you know, in this room, there's air. There's a bunch of gas
molecules, a large number of gas molecules. They're all bouncing around. They're all essentially
computing what they're going to do next. They have these collisions. There's a little computation
going on. For us, there's no way we can imagine following all those gas molecules. Of course.
Because we are computationally bounded. If we were not computationally bounded, we would say,
I've got all those gas molecules. I know what they're going to do. I know that in, you know,
five seconds, all this particular collection of gas molecules that were over here are going to
wind up over there. I'm able to, and so then I wouldn't, for example, say, oh, it's just a gas
with a certain pressure and so on. I would say, I know my friend, this gas molecule is going to do
this particular thing. Right. But we could be computationally bounded and still be able to do
that. It's just the bound on our computational processing would have to be much larger than
what it currently is. That was the distinction, right? I mean, you don't need to be computationally
unbounded to do that. You just need to be able to take in a kind of data set that's beyond our
capacity. Well, no, but, you know, you can, and this is where it kind of gets mathy. But, you know,
if you start thinking about, as you increase the size of the thing you're looking at, as you
increase the amount of time that is elapsing and so on, you very quickly get into the situation
where if you are of any bounded size, you will blow out your abilities. So this is the question
of whether, so for example, if we look at the long future of the universe, you know, one thing
people are sometimes kind of disappointed about is, oh, you know, there'll be a heat death in the
universe. Eventually, you know, all these processes, all these organized things that are happening in
the universe, it's all going to just grind down into random heat, random, you know, sort of motion
of molecules that are just completely random. And people say, that's terrible. That's the end of
everything that one might care about in this kind of random soup in the universe. But if you were
not computationally bounded, you wouldn't think that. Of course, you would say, every molecule,
I know where it's going to go. It's got its whole history that you can sort of read out from it.
Right. So that's an example of what it would be like to be not computationally bounded. You would
have a very different view. Now, you know, a thing that I find very challenging is to think about
what it's like to not be like us, so to speak. And, you know, I've tried, for example, these days
with, you know, we have AIs that are well aligned with the way we humans think about things.
So, you know, I did an experiment recently, you take an AI that's been trained on a few billion
images that we humans have put out on the web, and it can generate images. So you say, you know,
show me a picture of a cat and a party hat. Yeah. And it will generate something which is sort of
typical of what we humans would think of us being a cat and a party hat. Say, okay, that's what
that's a concept that we humans understand. Now let's move in kind of concept space,
which we can do inside this AI. We can say let's move in concept space away from the concept of
cat and a party hat. Let's move into what I was calling inter-concept space, the space between
the concepts that we humans have named. What's out there? Well, you can have the AI just generate
a picture of what's out there. What's out there is something that looks like it's a picture.
What does it mean to us? Right now, pretty much nothing. It's just some elaborate pattern,
some complicated picture. What is it? Well, we can kind of yak about it for a bit, but it doesn't
really have a resonance for us. And if we even go beyond that, and we say, let's modify the AI,
let's change its mind, so to speak, change the way its mind is built, and say, what does it then
think a cat and a party hat looks like? You get these weird pictures, which are very non-human.
They kind of begin to show us a little bit what it's like to be a mind that is not quite like a
human mind. And for me, it's a great exercise in imagination, which I don't think I've
sort of succeeded in mastering. I will say one thing, though, about the sort of inter-concept
space. One of the things that's really, really interesting about that is even the most basic
way of sort of exploring inter-concept space. The concepts that we humans have come up with
represent one part in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
I have to go on with a bunch of trillions there of what's possible. And then we ask ourselves,
well, will we ever get there? And what we realize is that's what the progress of science
and the sort of arc of intellectual history is all about. We are gradually expanding our domain
in kind of the space of concepts. We're gradually sort of expanding the paradigms that we think in
terms of and so on. It's a slow process, but that's kind of the journey that we can think of
as being kind of the journey of science and mathematics and these other kinds of areas.
Yeah, for sure. Now, look, when I began as a physicist and I have since changed or shifted
or matured, I don't know what the right word is, but when I began life as a physicist, I thought
that what I was engaging in was a search for the abstract and objective laws that were kind of out
there governing, you know, formation of stars, the big bang, black holes and things of that sort.
And many of my colleagues still speak that way and they feel deeply that is what the charge of
being a physicist or a scientist or generally is all about. I have shifted to a place where
it feels much closer to what you're saying. I've shifted to a place where I view what I do
and my colleagues and you do as trying to describe in concept space in the language that
makes sense to us as human beings what's happening out there. I no longer feel like the equations
that we write down for general relativity and quantum mechanics are kind of operating out
there, which is certainly the prejudice that I had as a younger person. If I understand correctly,
you are saying something quite similar that the goal of what we do as scientists is to find the
description that makes sense to us as, say, these computationally bounded observers with brains that
operate on time scales much shorter than the speed of light and so on and so forth to describe what's
out there. But do you think that there is an out there that is operating according to some laws,
rules, whatever we want to describe it that is at work? Of course, we're part of the out there,
so I don't mean to sort of juxtapose the two in that way. But is there some fundamental set of
rules that's really operating or is it all about finding the set of rules that do a good job at
describing your perceptions? Well, so I think there is a thing that's out there. We call it the
Ruliad and it's a weird, very abstract thing. It's not surprising that it's an abstract thing
because it's sort of a very conceptually big thing. What is it? It's essentially this object
that is the entangled limit of all possible computations. That's a very weird kind of concept
because usually you say, what is a computation? Well, you set up these rules, there might be the
rules for the way that the microprocessor in your computer works, you feed in some input,
you let the thing go crunch, crunch, crunch for a while, and then you get the output. That's
essentially the process of a single computation. One of the things that we can then ask is, well,
let's say we change the rules for the computation and we do the same thing. We feed in some input,
we get some output, we get different things going on. Let's imagine that we could look at what happens
with all possible rules, all possible inputs. One of the things is you say, well, how could you
ever conclude anything from that? Turns out that thing has a rich structure, not least because
two very different inputs and maybe even two very different ways of computing, rules for
computation, can wind up producing the same thing. You get this complicated entangled object that is
represents kind of all possible computations running, let's say, even for an infinite time
and looking at the sort of entangled structure of all these possible computations. It's a very
big abstract thing. One thing about it is there's only one of it. It's unique. It is the case that,
in a sense, once you have this idea of describing things according to rules, you inevitably get
this object. It is the limit of sort of describing everything in terms of rules. And so it's not
like you get to say, oh, I'll have really add number one. No, actually, I'll pick really add
number seven instead. There's only one of it. And it's kind of as inevitable as once you've defined
what two and two are and pluses and so on, it's inevitable at two plus two equals four. It's not
a thing where you get to say, might it be that way? Might it be a different way? It has to be the
way it is. So, Jessica, I understand that space well enough and perhaps how it relates to things
that have been articulated previously. When I was a student of Robert Nozick's philosopher at Harvard,
he had this idea that he was developing at the time called the principle of fecundity,
you know, sort of like all realities are out there in some way. I don't know if he framed it
precisely enough to draw a relationship, but Max Tegmark, you must know from MIT, had this idea of
the larger reality being all possible mathematical structures. They are just out there and we are
cognizant of a small slice of it. Is your Ruliad commensurate with those ideas?
No. I mean, I know what the Ruliad is and it's a very nice, precise thing. I have to say,
it's interesting because one of the things that's happened is we got to this place by doing
computation and physics and science and so on. And we've ended up with these constructs and concepts
that are sort of deeply philosophical, almost theological in some ways. And in many cases,
they sort of, they peel back, you know, the last 300 or so years, it's been kind of science has been
out ahead. But some of the things that we end up talking about are things which, you know, theologians
have talked about for centuries, but have been kind of submerged in modern science. So, you know,
the thing about sort of the thing we built with the Ruliad is it's a nice, precise, very well
defined thing. So how it relates to, I mean, people have asked me the particular, let's see,
I mean, I should keep the inventory of all the things that people ask, is it related to XYZ?
Because by the time you have this object that purports to be the underlying thing of all possible
reality, so to speak, it better be related to a lot of stuff. But so the answer is I don't really
have a great way to address that. I think that the concept, I mean, the thing that you're asking
what is it out there? And one of the things to realize is, and this is kind of a brain-twisting
kind of thing, as you were alluding to, there's no out there, we're in it. It is everything,
and we are part of it. So the question is really, how does an observer within the Ruliad made from
the same stuff that makes the Ruliad, what does that observer perceive about the Ruliad?
And the answer to the fact that there's anything reasonable one can say about that,
I consider remarkable. And the point is that for an arbitrary observer, there's not much you can say,
but for an observer with these limitations that we seem to have being the way that we are,
there are a bunch of things you can say. And what's really exciting is the things you can say
seem to align almost perfectly with the big things that we were able to say in 20th century physics,
which is super surprising. I mean, it's not what I thought was going to happen at all.
And I think this question about how do you perceive a thing when you're in that thing
is a, that's something where we've sort of been lucky that thanks to mathematics and physics,
basically, we have some of the tools necessary to actually talk about that. We understand things
like reference frames from relativity. We understand various things about measurement from quantum
mechanics. These are the things which are sort of the raw material that gives us a hope of sort of
turning what would otherwise be some kind of vague sort of philosophical concept into something that
we can actually sort of do hard science with. So I'd love to jump in to some of the details,
but I'm wondering if at the outset we could set expectations, really my expectations,
perhaps more than anything. I mean, the reason I believe, that's not even the right word. The
reason I have confidence in quantum mechanics, of course, is I know how to sit down with the basic
mathematics and given enough time and computational power, I know how to calculate things like a
scattering amplitude or the anomalous dipole moment of the electron. So I can
calculate things and I know that when those calculations are done correctly,
they agree to fantastic precision with things that we actually observe in the world. I know
how to sit down with general relativity and calculate the bending of starlight by the sun,
just to go all the way back to 1919. So where does your program stand before we get into the
details? Can you calculate like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron?
No, not that. But what we, you know, so here's where we're at. We can, in the case of, okay,
so we've got these three areas, statistical mechanics, general relativity, quantum mechanics.
Statistical mechanics is actually the easiest to talk about. Maybe we'll talk about it later.
Which one is?
Statistical mechanics is actually the easiest to talk about. It has just, but in general
relativity, for example, we can calculate, so for example, we have a nice calculation now of
the merging of two black holes. And it seems to agree well with the predictions of general
relativity. In fact, it seems to agree well enough that the method that we have of computing,
so normally, as you well know, when you're computing something like merging of two black
holes, you're studying kind of the, all these differential equations that represent the kind
of curvature of spacetime and so on. And when you actually do it on a computer, after you probably
pre-processed it a bunch with Mathematica, but eventually you try and discretize the spacetime
so that you can put it on a digital computer.
Yes.
In our methods, and we'll talk about this in more detail, we're starting from the discrete
underlying structure of spacetime. And we're then aggregating up to see what consequences that has on
a large scale. And it turns out that the thing we've built seems to be a very good way of just
computing what happens in general relativity.
So, Francis, could you calculate, you know, the gravitational waves that say LIGO observed,
say, from the first black hole?
Yeah, looks like it. It's very convenient that black holes, oh yeah, we've got a nice little
video there that, yeah, we can show you this video.
Yeah, what are we seeing here?
Yeah, that's what we're seeing. We're seeing two little very, very tiny black holes close
in size to the elementary length in the universe, and there they merged. And if you sort of analyze
this a bit, you'll find there are gravitational waves that came out of that merger. And, you know,
it's looking good in terms of agreeing with what is predicted from general relativity and observed.
Do you mean like the surface area is non-decreasing of the merged black hole, that sort of agreement?
Yes, but also you can look at the actual ring down and you can look at, and it seems right.
And it's, you know, I think this is something that is now getting much more precisely validated
because people actually want to use our models as a scheme for doing the numerical relativity.
I mean, it's kind of funny because the people who say this is a good scheme for doing the
numerical relativity. And for them, if it disagrees with standard relativity, it's like,
oh, that's a really bad thing. For us, that's really exciting because it gives us a kind of a
sort of a crack through which to see kind of things like the discreteness of space.
So in the case of general relativity, we're in, I think, pretty good shape. We have
good agreement with what you would expect from in the domains where you expect agreement
with general relativity. And we have a lot of weird effects, which we haven't yet been able to
compute quite what their magnitude should be, quite how they work. They depend on one parameter
whose value we don't know, but we have a bunch of funky things. We'll talk about it, things like
dimension fluctuations in the universe. But before we go there, just so on that, on the image that
you showed, you mentioned that the size of the black holes was on par with the elementary size of,
so these are tiny black holes. So what sets the scale? And just again, for the audience,
in general relativity, we have various numbers that come in, Newton's constant, if we're
including the speed of light, that's a useful number to come in. If we're doing something that
has quantum aspects to it, we bring an H bar from quantum mechanics, we put those together,
we can get a fundamental length scale called the Planck length, about 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,
a fundamental energy scale, the Planck mass, about 10 to the 19 times the mass of a proton,
a fundamental time scale, about 10 to minus 43 seconds of Planck time. So where does any of that
come in? Well, I mean, that all comes in. Let me give a little bit of the status report,
because you asked for that. And then let's get into explaining how the model actually works,
because I think it's, so general relativity, nice checkmark, we really have, we can really
see how things align with general relativity. But with those tiny black holes, like do they
hawking radiate? That's a good question. We are just working on that. It's looking very promising.
But now you're asking, and again, I have to explain a bunch more, because what we saw there
was a classical picture. We actually have the sort of full quantum version, but it is, for the
universe, that's the computation the universe does. For us, it's very difficult to do that
computation. It's a lot of computation. But yes, in our models, there absolutely is the,
I mean, we can't yet say we get the hawking temperature and all that kind of thing. It
is pretty promising that we get ER equals EPR, which we can explain what that all is.
It's very clear kind of how the ADS-CFT correspondence works in our models, things
like that. Again, technical stuff, we can get to it. How about the singularity? How about the
black hole singularity? Do you get any insight into that? Yes. I mean, well, we should, we're
coming into the space, because I mean, because we have discrete spacetime, the world of singularity
is a bit different than it is in continuous spacetime. And so, for example, topology change is
very easy in a discrete spacetime, and we absolutely see that. But let's, just in terms of
where we're at, they're so sort of generativity, pretty good shape. Quantum mechanics, we can
do a good job of reproducing sort of standard quantum information, quantum circuits type
quantum mechanics. And in fact, you can even take a quantum circuit and you can compile it
into our models, do computations at that level, and actually you get somewhat better,
more efficient ways to optimize quantum circuits than we've had before. So that's, that works okay.
Quantum field theory. Wait, can you do particle in a box? I'm just wondering, I mean, can you
do the basic? Well, okay, so the one thing I kind of elided there, particles are tough for us. We
don't yet know, and we'll explain how this works, but, but kind of particles for us are like, if you
had a fluid like water or something, you know, a little eddy on the surface of the water. And
those are kind of like what we think particles are in our models, and figuring out what the
spectrum of particles like electrons and photons and quarks and so on is in our models. No, we
have not been able to do that yet. We know the path to do that, but it is technically complicated,
and we're just working up to it. I think that the, I mean, one of the things that's amazing about
these models is usually you make a model for something, you kind of compare it with experimental
data, say, oh, whoops, that piece of the model doesn't quite work. Let me tweak the model to fix
that and so on. We're now at, you know, three and a half years out, and we are zero tweaks.
That is, there's not a single thing where we've said, oops, you know, model doesn't agree with
this, let's change the model. It is very hard work to go from the underlying model to the actual
observable characteristics of physics. But the thing that's just amazing, as far as I'm concerned,
is that, as I say, we're at zero tweaks. Yeah. You know, there's no, oh, whoops, you know, the
thing predicts we have different number of dimensions than we do, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
There's no, I mean, having said that, we don't know why the universe has, appears to us right now
to have three dimensions. We can't derive the number three. Three or three large dimensions,
perhaps. What's that? Yeah, three large dimensions, right. And we, you know, we can talk about what
the question of, so one of the things that has happened is a lot of different approaches in
mathematical physics, like, you know, causal set theory, spin networks, higher...
Dynamical triangulations, I presume. Yes, dynamical triangulations. These are all
things that we can see are limits of our models. The one that's still out there, a string theory,
which I'm pretty sure is also a limit of our models, but that just, that mathematical physics
hasn't been done. It'll be very nice when it is done. And what's really cool about seeing
this correspondence with existing work in mathematical physics is that, you know, there's
a lot that's been achieved there. And so we can just sort of plug in the things that have been
achieved and learn more about our models and also provide interesting foundations for what's
been done in other areas of mathematical physics. I mean, like for example, in causal set theory,
for example, people just say, oh, there are events that happen in different places in
spacetime. And it's always been kind of confusing, why would relativity work,
given that there's sort of these random events at different places in spacetime? In our models,
there are events at different places in spacetime, but they are kind of algorithmically
generated. And the way in which they're generated inevitably gives relativity.
So you get to kind of talk about things using the sort of machinery of causal set theory.
But now you've got a foundation that says there isn't this big problem that there used to be,
and you can kind of work from there. But briefly, you were about to say something
about quantum field theory. So could you finish that?
So I mean, the thing that, as I say, the next challenge we're working on right now
is doing the same kind of thing for quantum field theory that we've been able to do for
general relativity. That is starting from the underlying model and just doing a bunch of computation
and being able to reproduce features of quantum field theory. And it's pretty clear what the
roadmap for doing that is. It's just technically difficult.
Can I say a quick question on that? And again, we're going a little nonlinear
here, but that's fine. Our audience is used to that. To me, quantum mechanics is quantum
field theory in zero plus one dimensions. And quantum field theory, as you normally describe it,
is therefore just quantum mechanics in, say, a signature n comma one reality, an n plus one
dimensions. Why would it be, for what I understand that you're going to describe, dimensionality
is so fluid in your approach. I would have thought they'd gone from quantum mechanics
to quantum field theory as like no problem at all. Okay. So here's what happens. And now we are
definitely jumping around here. When we think about quantum mechanics, we're thinking about
these many possible paths of history. And that's kind of the defining feature of quantum mechanics
is it's not that definite things happen. It's that there are many paths of history,
and we just get to observe certain aggregates of those paths of history.
So in our models, the simplest case that corresponds to sort of minimal sort of quantum
information style quantum mechanics, looks at those different paths of history and just says,
take the whole universe, and say there's this path of history for the whole universe,
take the whole universe, these kinds of things. That that is a very wasteful way to represent
things. And it doesn't deal with the spatial degrees of freedom of what's going on. If you try
and do that sort of more less wastefully, and you say, no, I don't just want to say there's a whole,
complete state of the universe, and it branches to another complete state of the universe,
but you want to get inside there and say, well, actually, it's just this little tiny piece of
the universe that's different between these two branches. And you're dealing with space,
which is the thing that, so what's happening is most of space is unchanged. There's just this
tiny part of space that's changed. It's just technically more difficult to do that. And so
that's why there's a distinction between kind of quantum mechanics in the sort of quantum
information style of doing quantum mechanics and this quantum field theory, where there is a
spatial extent that one has to deal with, and one actually is talking about
scattering processes and particles that are moving. I mean, for example, in our models,
we maybe come to this, the idea that motion is possible is non-travel. In other words,
the fact that you can take a thing and move it to somewhere else, and it's still the same thing,
is not obvious. I mean, in traditional general relativity, if you're close to a spacetime
singularity, any material thing that you try and move there is going to get shredded,
and it's probably not the same thing. But in our models, the possibility of motion is something
you have to derive. And so we can derive it for things like black holes. We need to find out
for what other things we can define it. And those other things for which we can define it,
those are particles, basically, because particles are the carriers of identity
that survive under through time and through space. But finding what those are is just
technically difficult. So can you take us back now more to the beginning? And this is sort of a
good summary chaotic, though it may have been because of my random questions, and I apologize
for that. But if we take a step back now, where does it begin? I've done a little bit of reading,
but no doubt I am incompletely read in on the subject, but presumably it begins with
just some collection of nodes. Yeah, what's the universe made of? And that's been the thing
people have discussed since antiquity. And is it made of discrete atoms? Is it a continuous thing?
That was something much debated. What is matter made of? We discovered 100 and something years ago,
it's made of discrete molecules. We definitively know that. Light, same way. We can think of
it as made of photons. Space, on the other hand, we have tended to assume is continuous. We've
assumed that space is just this background thing, and we can put stuff anywhere we want in space.
Kind of the starting point for our models is space is not just this background thing.
Space is actually made of stuff. And in fact, everything in the universe we can think of
as being features of space. And so, in fact, the way that there are many equivalent ways to think
about this, because it's a deeply abstract thing. But the way that I think is most kind of we talked
about sort of what is the role of science about sort of, you know, converting what's out there in
the world to human understandable narratives. The best one I know for explaining this is the
following. To just say what space is made of is kind of these discrete atoms of space, which are
things where the only thing you can say about them is they have an identity. They are distinct
from each other. And then the other thing you can say is how those atoms of space are related to
each other. So in other words, we can say this atom of space is related to these two other atoms
of space. What do we get when we have this whole big collection of relations? We can represent that
as a kind as a graph, but we're saying it's kind of like a friend network. What's the friend
network of the atoms of space, so to speak. And maybe in our universe today, there might be 10 to
the 400 atoms of space. We're not sure. But but it's a very large number.
In the observable in the observable universe presumably in the observable universe and that
the full rule yard is much bigger than that. Yeah. The universe says we've sliced it and so on.
But but then this so so we've got this giant network that has, you know, these these atoms of
space related in these ways. And so then the and that's kind of what we think everything in the
universe is made of. And so, for example, particles are these black holes, for example, are particular
regions that have certain characteristics that correspond to the way that black holes work.
Particles are these things that are kind of like topologically knotted up pieces of that network,
we think, that have some kind of, you know, continued identity. So that's kind of the idea of
that's what's that's what the universe is made of. It's kind of interesting to me as a historical
matter that back, you know, beginning of the 20th century, many people had the belief that space
was discreet. In fact, I keep on discovering that many of those famous physicists that we
both know about, you know, I keep on discovering, you know, Heisenberg thought that space was
discreet, Bohr thought that space was discreet, Einstein thought that space was discreet. It was
1916, Einstein has this nice letter where he says, in the end, it will turn out that space is discreet.
Really? But we don't yet have the tools necessary to see how that works.
Huh. I mean, I would understand it well for all the other luminaries that you made reference to
because the discreteness of reality was emerging with the vengeance through the studies in quantum
mechanics. Einstein too, photoelectric effect, you know, the discreteness, but I had no idea
that he actually thought that when it came to space time. I'd love to see that. So offline,
I'll get the right. No, it's a but but so, you know, and what happened at the time was
nobody could get kind of their discreet models of space to agree with relativity. Yeah. And
it was, you know, and I'm not surprised, given what we now know, it required another few layers
of kind of paradigmatic thinking, so to speak, to be able to get something where that was not
difficult to achieve. But but so okay, so in our models, sort of what's there in the universe is
this giant network that represents kind of the state of the universe, the state of space,
everything in the in the universe is a feature of space. So then the question is, what about time?
And, you know, one of the things that was sort of the, you know, people have tended to say is,
oh, space and time are the same kind of thing. I don't think Einstein actually thought that so
much. Minkowski was the was the he bought into Minkowski's view pretty, pretty quickly and pretty
fully. Right, right. Minkowski, though, was the one who was like, we can make this spacetime object
and it has very nice mathematical properties and so on. But but so I don't think space and time
are anything like the same kind of thing. I think they're very different kinds of things. I think
time, we can think of as sort of the inexorable progress of computation. So time is this thing
where we're applying the rules, and we keep on applying and we keep on applying them,
that successive application of rules, that is the progress of time. And so in the case of these
models, what happens is you've got this giant network, and you have these rules that say if you
have a little piece of network that looks like this, rewrite it to a piece of network that looks
like that, you just keep doing that over and over again. And time is defined by those progressive
rewritings. So then the question is, when you do that for a very big network, and you do that for
a very long period of time, many, many rewritings, what is the aggregate, what do you see in aggregate?
It's kind of like asking, you know, these molecules are bouncing around at a microscopic scale, what
will be the large scale sort of behavior of the system? And we know in the case of molecules
bouncing around, oh, it's fluids like water and so on, that's what you get from this sort of large
scale structure. So the question is, what do you get from this graph? It's actually a hypergraph
we tend to use. And, you know, these rewrite rules and so on, what do you get? What's the large
scale limit? Well, with various footnotes that we can talk about, the answer is the large scale
limit is Einstein's equations for spacetime. And are you talking about the vacuum equations?
No, no, it's the full equations, but you have to say what, so okay, so just to fill that in.
So, I mean, remember, I'm saying everything in the universe is made of space. So when we get
energy, for example, a matter, they are just features of space. And we have to characterize
what it means to have a piece of space that is representing matter and energy and mass and so on.
And turns out, and this is something really surprised me, that energy turns out to be basically
the density of updates happening in this network. And there's a slightly more formal definition
that's a flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces. But basically, it's the amount of
updating that's happening in the network that characterizes the density of energy associated
with that part of the network. And so then we ask questions like, okay, here's an example of
something that you could ask, as you say, let's talk about gravity. How does gravity work? Well,
so, you know, we can talk about if in the absence of gravity, you know, things move on shortest paths.
So, you know, we have gd6 shortest paths from here to there. In a graph, it's pretty easy to define
what a shortest path is, because it's just from every node, you just have an edge, you follow that
until you get to some other edge. So you have this the shortest path. Now you ask, in this model,
what happens when there's a bunch of activity in the network? And it turns out that that
deflects shortest paths, the gd6 have changed by this activity in the network. And the way they're
changed is exactly according to the Einstein equations, according to standard laws of gravity.
And that's so, so can you just abuse me of a couple of worries that immediately
come to mind? So worry number one is, again, you know, we'll talk at various levels of
sophistication. So I hope the audience will bear with us. But you know, in general activity,
as many in the audience know, we describe space time continuously as some manifold on which there's
a distance function, so-called a metric. And usually, as we describe it, we try to solve the
Einstein equations to figure out what the metric is, the distance function of that space. But of
course, we could always say that any metric is a solution to the Einstein's equation, simply by
defining the right hand side to be what comes out of the Einstein tensor for the given metric that
you put in. So trivially, any metric has a solution to the Einstein's equation from that
perspective. The only time it becomes non-trivial is if you have an independent definition of the
left hand side and the right hand side. But if everything for you is a feature of space time,
do you have an independent definition on the left and the right hand side? Or is it just
a tautology? Right. So the fact that I'm describing what energy is, is that independent, so to speak.
And also, the fact that, for example, in that black hole simulation, those are vacuum solutions to
the Einstein equations. There is no separate kind of, you know, separate place where we're
identifying, I mean, where we're- But subject to particular boundary conditions.
Exactly. Yes. Yes, that had to be set up with very particular boundary conditions.
But I mean, just to give some kind of sketch of how things emerge. So we've got this giant
network. And the question is, how do you extract from that something that seems like continuous
space? Okay. So first thing you have to do is this network, it just says how all the atoms of
space are related. It doesn't, for example, tell you like where the atoms of space are. There's no
where yet. And so first thing you have to do is start defining, you know, what is the effective
dimension of the space that this represents. So you can do that by saying, start at a particular
position in this network. Go to all the nodes that are distance one from that in terms of just
following one edge in the graph. Oh, and calculate the volume or something of this here.
Calculate the volume of the GDC ball, the volume of what you get to if you go r steps.
And as that grows, if the leading term is r to the power d, then you can identify d as the
dimension. Okay, then you look at the subleading term, and there's a correction to the r to the
d growth. And that correction is proportional to the Richie scalar curvature. So that's telling you
that that correction tells you the, you know, a measure of the curvature of space. And so by
doing things like that, you can kind of see how to tease out from this ultimately very discrete
structure, you can kind of tease out kind of the standard continuum things. And you get to the,
you know, the Richie tensor, for example, comes out in a nice way. It's again a little bit more
tricky because you're dealing with the space time Richie tensor, you're dealing with these
light cones that you have to construct in this kind of space as a function of time and so on.
So it's, you know, there's some technical now, just to explain the technical complexity of this
is when you talk about a manifold, a manifold is kind of a representation of geometry,
where you look microscopically, microscopically, microscopically, it's just geometry in the
way that Euclid defined geometry, it's Euclidean space. In our case, we look microscopically,
microscopically, there's just a hypergraph down there, there's no underlying Euclidean like space.
And so we kind of have to build our own new version of geometry, we're calling it for now
infra geometry, where we start from this, this underlying structure, and we have to build up
the features of differential geometry from that. And we're sort of midway through doing a fairly
rigorous kind of development of kind of what is, you know, what is geometry like when it
isn't based on a manifold based on Euclidean space. And by the way, that answers questions like,
what does the curvature tensor like in three and a half dimensional space?
Nobody, there is no literature, I'd be thrilled if you tell me there's literature on this,
we found no literature on the subject. I mean, this is this is not a thing people have ever,
you know, had had reason or ability to explore. Yeah, we can analytically continue, you know,
sometimes you need to do that when the integrals are not well defined, but I don't think we've ever
really grappled. No, I mean, in quantum field theory, you know, we do a little bit of dimensional,
you know, four minus epsilon dimensions and so on. But but in the in the case of differential
geometry, that's not what's been explored. Here's worry number two, if you don't, if you don't,
please go ahead. So, Einstein famously spent 10 years writing down or figuring out what ultimately
are the Einstein field equations that he famously gave the world in November of 1915.
When we look back on what Einstein wrote down, with hindsight, of course, it's kind of pretty
obvious that it had to be once once you're dealing with curvature, and once you're dealing with energy
momentum is described by this particular symmetric two tensor, there aren't that many things that you
can put on the left hand side. So in fact, you could put them all there and just label them by
the number of derivatives that they have, keep the ones with the lowest number of derivatives,
then just impose some conservation equation and pretty much that gets you to the Einstein equation.
So what worries me is getting those equations out, perhaps is less impressive to me than it
should be. And maybe you can get me to the point of being really impressed, because there's not
much that it could have been, because presumably, you're going for the lowest order piece, we could
talk about higher order corrections as well. Absolutely. There's not much that it could have
been besides arm you new mind to have G mu new R on the left hand side. Yeah, you're right. The thing
that we didn't know is how to go from something lower level to that. In other words, it's just like
saying, you look at the fluid equations for how a bunch of gas molecules or liquid molecules or
something, what the aggregate behavior of those things is. In that case, also, there's not much
else it could be the Navier-Stokes equations are sort of inevitable, given certain characteristics.
But in that case, it was a non-trivial thing, even given the Navier-Stokes equations, they were
known long before we knew that molecules existed. But knowing that what's underneath there is a
bunch of molecules bouncing around, that's the thing that's worth knowing. And you're right,
that for me also, the Einstein equations seem obvious. And in fact, the same is true of quantum
mechanics. In our models, quantum mechanics seems obvious as well. But the fact is that
it's been possible to derive this from something, first of all, lower level, just this kind of
discrete machine code. And more extremely than that, this Roulillard object, that is kind of a
necessary thing, the fact that it's possible to derive these things from that, that to me is rather
remarkable. And let me just to fill in a little bit about sort of how to think about this. Let's
talk about the thing that I said was going to be the easiest one of the three big theories of 20th
century physics, namely statistical mechanics. So the big result of statistical mechanics is the
second rule of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase, the rule that says, the law that says,
if you start systems off in a kind of orderly state, they will tend to degrade to disorder,
or they will, if you have a bunch of molecules and they're all going in the same direction and
kind of doing mechanical work pushing in the same direction, chances are things will randomize and
it will turn into heat. And so that's the second law. And people have wondered, could you derive
the second law? In fact, Einstein, interestingly, something I just learned, you may have known
this for a long time. In 1905, Einstein wrote these three amazing papers that established
relativity, quantum mechanics, and Brownian motion. And the size of Adam's model. So it's
really four, I'd like to count the fourth one. But anyway, go ahead. Okay, that's interesting.
Okay, the question is, what were the papers that Einstein wrote in the three years leading up to
that time in 1905? The answer is, Einstein wrote papers trying to prove the second law of thermodynamics.
And the papers were wrong. They were philosophically interesting. They very much followed Boltzmann,
who had been kind of the person who was originally pushing the idea of sort of molecular theory of
gases, early derivations of the second law and so on. And Einstein sort of thought he could derive
the second law. He didn't succeed. He used the same kind of almost philosophical approaches to
science and applied them in these other areas and, you know, amazing results, so to speak.
That's just a footnote to history. But you know, people believe that the second law
will be derivable. That is, if you knew the mechanics of the molecules, it would be inevitable
that you would get this tendency towards randomization. It's very confusing, like Boltzmann,
for example, had his H theorem that said, oh, well, if you have these molecules bouncing around
this quantity H, which is, well, basically, the entropy will increase with time, well,
H will decrease with time, the entropy will increase with time. But the problem is-
But he put in the input, the output, if you look at it more closely.
Yes. Yeah, right, exactly. I mean, the thing that's mysterious about this is that if you
look at the individual collisions of molecules, they are reversible in time. There's nothing,
you know, you look at the little movie of the billiard balls bouncing, you could run backwards,
you would know the difference. But in aggregate, when you look at all those gas molecules, you
absolutely can tell things go from orderly initial states to disordered final states.
And the question is, why do we believe that? And the answer is, because we are observers of the
kind we are. And here's how to think about it, I think. That is, because we are computationally
bounded observers, even though there is, in principle, we can think of it as sort of an
encryption process. We start off with a simple initial condition, then we're doing all this
computation, and that's grinding up that initial condition into something that looks to us
encrypted and random. If we were sufficiently computationally sophisticated, we'd be able
to say, hey, I understand what that is, I can just reverse it and see that it came from that
simple initial condition. But because we're computationally bounded, we don't get to do that.
And so, in fact, the phenomenon of the second law is a consequence of a very computational
kind of thing. It's a consequence, okay, so there's one more piece that I have to explain.
But before you get to that detail, and I hope I'm not throwing you off track, but there is
something that's confusing about what you just said, maybe you can clarify it in half a second.
So I agree with you that this being that did not suffer from the limitations that we have
would see all the molecules and all the trajectories and be able to immediately reverse it and
recognize where it came from and so on and so forth. But that being would also have the capacity
to say, hey, there's a more useful way to think about this too. I'm not going to erase my capacity
to see all the molecules and their trajectories, but coarse-graining seems to be a useful tool for
me to use so that I can have a language that talks about the molecules just filling the room,
as opposed to the trajectory of each individual molecule. And for some discourse, it's useful
to have that approximation, that coarse-graining. The being would still be able to do that. They
would not necessarily be wedded to the level of detail that would put the second law of thermodynamic
business. That's true. But the issue, and this relates to the march of paradigms, so to speak.
There are things that we would now say, oh, it's obvious you described this aspect of the world
this way, but looked at with different instruments, looked at without a telescope, looked at without
whatever, we would just describe the world differently. And I think that the saying that,
oh, yes, you could aggregate this and say, oh, well, it's just roughly this going on. The
computationally unbounded being might say, why would you want to do that? I can figure out everything.
Why would I need to look at this aggregate thing? That's irrelevant. I mean, it's kind of like
there are plenty of situations where, as we've, in the practical world, where we get more and
more data about things, one might have said, oh, I don't know, take some medical finding. You might
have said, oh, you look pale today. Well, okay, we can convert that in modern times to, this is the
precise metabolomics that we can measure of this and that and the other. And then the, oh, you look
pale today, it doesn't seem like the most relevant thing to say, so to speak. And so I think it's
hard to project. You're absolutely right. There's nothing that would prevent sort of an entity that
can do this unbounded computation from deciding to aggregate things in that way. On the other hand,
it's, you know, it's a, it's a, the fact that we are led to aggregate things in the way that we do
is a consequence of the way that we are. For sure. But, but, you know, I should explain one,
one other very important piece, which is this phenomenon I call computational irreducibility,
which is something that I, I mean, I started figuring out in the early 1980s, actually,
and it's the following thing. So, so one of the kind of sort of ideas that one gets from
mathematical physics is once you've got the equation, you've solved the problem more or less.
I mean, that is that the equation, it's like, I've got it now, and I can work out every consequence
from that. When you're in the computational world, that's no longer true in the same sense.
You've got some rules, you start running the rules. You say because you run the rules will take so
long that you can't do it any faster than running the rules. Right. Right. And so this, this,
this fact that you can't jump ahead and say, and the answer is going to be X,
you have to just run every step and see what happens. That's kind of a new feature of the
computational world, a little different than we'd ever understood in the mathematical world.
I mean, by the way, it's not like people hadn't intuitively understood this. I mean, you know,
Newton, for example, famously said, you know, the, the, when you're talking about many planets
in the solar system, you know, he says, it's now got the equations, but to work out the
motion of all these planets is, I think he said, if I'm not mistaken, beyond the capability of any
human mind, you thought God could do it, but no human mind could do it. So he already had this
idea of kind of the sort of irreducible computational difficulty of working out the
consequences of things. But we see that much more extremely in these computational settings.
And that's, by the way, that sort of the, that's what time, that's the sort of hard aspect of
time, so to speak, that time, the passage of time means something because it is an irreducible
computation. You know, we, we get to live our lives and do all the things we do. And we can't
just jump ahead and say, and the answer is going to be 47 or something. We have to kind of live
the time to, it means something to live the time, so to speak. So we can lack free will,
but we can never predict what we're going to do. So it all works out. Yes, exactly so. Right.
I think, but so, so the, the, you know, in this case of, of, of the second law, the thing that's
very critical is this underlying computational irreducibility. If it wasn't for the fact that it
is difficult to do that decryption of what happened, if that was still easy, then there
wouldn't be any, we wouldn't say, oh, it looks random. We would just say, oh, it's obvious,
you know, I can, I can see it's this. So it's this interplay between the computational irreducibility
of what's going on underneath and our computational limitations in our ability to observe things.
And that's what, that's what kind of gives us, in this case, the second law. Now, you know,
once you've understood those principles, it's kind of obvious the second law has to work.
But before you understand those things, I mean, if you read, I spent a bunch of effort really
untangling the history of the second law and, and the incredible confusions that, that developed
because people didn't understand these kind of essentially computational principles,
because they were 100 years too early to understand those things. And yes, you know,
the thing that's great and, and always, you know, very encouraging when you have some model and you
figure things out and so on, if you can go back at the end and say that was obvious, that's a huge
win. You know, if you say, no, you know, you have to, you know, pile all these stones up in just
exactly this way. And then eventually, we'll get this big tower, that's much less satisfying than
if you say, well, I should have been able to see that long ago. And that's kind of more the situation
we're in now. Now, having said that, the, you know, when you ask about like, what are the
experimental implications and so on, figuring out, you know, what is the dimension flag,
do the consequence of dimension fluctuations, that's a bunch of just difficult physics work.
So let me give you an example of how that works. So in our models, probably the universe started
infinite dimensional. And gradually, it kind of cooled down to be effectively three dimensional.
So if we had this initial network where everything was connected to everything,
and then gradually it got to be more like three dimensions where, you know, there's, it's, things
can be far apart, so to speak. But when you say early, just kind of get a feel here. Do you envision
early on, there's like a primordial node? Or is there some primordial configuration? How does it
begin? Oh, yes. Well, that's a, that's a fun thing in the, in the life of the Ruliad. Because,
um, it's, okay, so if we, okay, there's a, the Ruliad in a sense has no beginning. But in a sense,
it is, you have to talk about it. The object itself is just, what can I say, it's kind of like a
circle. Where's the beginning of the circle? It's like, well, if we are actually going to
draw the circle on a piece of paper, then there's a beginning to it. But conceptually,
there's no beginning to it. Yeah. It's, it's just is. And it's the same thing here. And when we,
a thing to understand about this is that, that we're, as, as we are observers in embedded in this
Ruliad, we can be at different positions in the Ruliad. So let's talk about that in terms of ordinary
space. So we have physical space, and we have a certain view about what's happening in the
universe. Our view of what's happening in the universe depends on where we are. You know,
we're on this planet and this galaxy, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. If we were somewhere else,
we have it, it would have a different view of what's going on. Now, more abstractly in the Ruliad,
we, a mind, so to speak, is at some place in the Ruliad. Different minds are in effect at
different places in the Ruliad. Different minds attribute, in a sense, different sets of rules
to what happened in the universe. There is a notion of motion in the Ruliad, just like there's
motion in physical space, just like as we move to a different place, we're still the same us.
There is a similar kind of concept of motion in the Ruliad that we can say there is this
entity, and there's another entity nearby, and these two entities will have sort of corresponding
views of what's happening. You know, when we talk about sort of alien intelligences, we can think
about that as more distant things than the Ruliad. It's like all humans are clumped in this little,
little, just as we are clumped on this little planet, so to speak. We're also clumped in a small
region of the Ruliad. All our minds are concentrated in this small region of the Ruliad. As we go to,
your cat or dog or something, it's a little bit further away. As we go to the weather, for example,
it's much further away. Communicating across the Ruliad, translating from one place
in Rulial space to another, is not so easy. That's why there's not good alignment between
these different things. But I think in, let's see, you were asking about sort of the beginning
of things. Yeah, so if we stick to physical space for a moment, can you describe to us
how in your approach a space resembling ours can be built up? And I saw some animation that you
had that may assist in giving people... Yeah, right. We can look at, let's see, what was this? This was
number one there. So tell us what we're seeing here. Okay, so this is just a possible beginning
of our universe. So if we start it again at the very beginning, it'll start off from just one
node and it'll keep on being rewritten and building up new nodes and new nodes and so on.
And this is a ridiculously small amount of effectively time at the beginning of the universe.
And there's a very simple rule for starting with a node and what to do next.
Exactly. And you keep going long enough and you will get, even with this particular rule,
you'll get something which has kind of the, an aggregate seems like continuous space,
just like if we had enough molecules bouncing around, it would seem like a continuous fluid.
And in here, you can apply your technique for working out the dimensionality of the space.
Like you're saying, you started to give a node, consider all the one edge motions or two edge
motions, look at the volume of the space that you fill out, and in that way get some notion
of dimensionality. And so in this particular case, the answer is about 2.6. And so do you,
do you imagine, you know, I don't even know if this is the right language in the approach you're
taking, but if we think about the Big Bang, does it start with a node? I mean, like, what?
You can, okay, so you can, this is why I was starting to explain about different places
in rural space and so on. There is in standard relativity, we're talking about different
reference frames, different ways to slice what counts as space, what counts as time and so on.
Same story in rural space. So you can, it's the same kind of thing. There is a view of the
universe in which it starts with one node. And that view of the universe may be a useful view
of the universe for a mind of a particular kind. It's not the only possible view of the
universe. But that's a possible, that is one reference frame, essentially, one rural reference
frame that is the coordination of the universe in that particular way of sort of foliating
rural space, that particular way of picking reference frames. And so that's a reasonable,
I think it's a reasonable way to start talking about things. It's not the only possible way,
just like in relativity, you could pick a different coordinate system and so on and
you would have a different kind of narrative description of what's going on, even though
in an underlying sense, it's the same stuff going on. So it's a little bit slippery that way.
Now it seems, again, I have to admit I'm fairly naive on the questions I'm asking. So if you
want to even correct my questions, I'm perfectly fine with that. But it would seem from the picture
that you showed us, the animation that you showed us, that the notion of expanding space seems
fairly visible and intuitive. Is that a reasonable way of articulating in some gross
continuous geometry sense, what we're seeing happening?
I think so. I think so. I mean, I've been wondering about that sort of the expansion of space
and how to think about that. And it certainly echoes for me, Einstein famously had written down
his equations and said, oh my gosh, these equations imply that the universe expands,
I better add this cosmological term as a correction to prevent that happening.
But actually, the universe does expand. And I have to say, in what we've got,
the obvious conclusion is the universe expands because there are more nodes getting made.
But there's a more bizarre possible thing that's going on, which is that as time goes on,
you're generating more and more nodes, and the universe is in a sense getting finer and finer.
Our length scale is fixed, but the universe is getting finer and finer. And in fact, one of the
more bizarre possibilities when you ask, is the universe discrete or continuous, for example,
one of the more bizarre possibilities, which we can't yet exclude, is that if you say, okay,
I'm going to measure, I'm going to measure the elementary length. And I'm going to take a certain
amount of time to measure the elementary length. It could be that by the time you've done that
measurement, the universe has subdivided itself to the point where that measurement no longer makes
sense. So we don't, I don't think we fully understand yet what the notion of the expansion of
space and so on. So just to be a little bit more technical, one of the things we've been very
interested in, you know, in standard relativity and cosmology and so on, there's, you know,
the Roberts and Walker, Friedman, Roberts and Walker, whatever, the more names have been added
to that since I, since I first started studying. Lemaitre deserves a place in that list.
I know he has a good history, right? But anyway, so the, in any case, that's kind of an aggregate
description of the universe, which just says the universe is roughly this big. And we're not going
to, we're going to assume that everything about the universe is otherwise homogeneous.
We would really like to extend that to include dimension as a dynamical parameter. In addition
to curvature, size of the universe, we want to include dimension. And I think we will understand
a lot more about how this works when we have that kind of aggregate dimension changing equation for
the sort of aggregate evolution of the universe. So I'm, but presumably your, your, your dimension
changing quality settles down pretty quickly. Otherwise it's hard to imagine how we get stars
and galaxies, at least in our little corner of this picture, right? Yes. Yeah. Well, I mean,
okay. So one of the things that I am suspecting right now is that the universe is only three
dimensional for observers like us. And that, and I don't yet know what attribute, you know, observers
like us have all kinds of weird attributes. You know, we assume that we're, you know, we're
persistent in time. We assume that we are in a sense localized in space. We assume things about
free will, for example, we assume all kinds of stuff, which seems so obvious to us that we
don't even identify it as an assumption. But it is my guess that some aspect of the way that we
exist as observers causes us to parse the universe as three dimensional. But I mean,
I think I understand what you're saying. But of course, we have all these very
precise experimental results in terms of, you know, how the gravitational field falls off with
distance. And, you know, and these are all consistent with, you know, a three dimensional
space. You would want me to interpret those as something which an observer like me would
necessarily measure because of my own constitutional. Yeah, because you're measuring,
you know, in what are those measurements, those measurements assume things like,
okay, let me, let me start taking apart those measurements. Okay, you're right. You've got
material objects, distinct objects. You think you can put those objects at arbitrary positions
from each other. That is an assumption about free will. It's, you know, there's a whole raft of
assumptions are being made. And, you know, the experiment you're doing is a highly worthwhile
experiment to do. But it's an experiment with all kinds of stuff that's been put into it.
And, you know, so in terms of what we expect for the universe, the, the, you know, we expect that
there will be dimension fluctuations. That is, that, you know, in aggregate, the universe,
we don't know why it's three, but the universe will appear to observers like us to be three
dimensional. But we would expect that there will be fluctuations, places left over from the early
universe where the universe was about 3.01 dimensional, let's say, and gradually kind of
calm down to being three dimensional. We don't know why it's three, as I say. But so big question
is how long did the dimension fluctuations last? And we're starting to do simulations to try and
figure that out. The obvious thing from a practical physics point of view is that they last until
the cosmic microwave background was formed. And could we detect them in aspects of the cosmic
microwave background? Of course, we don't know the answer to that yet. But it's certainly an,
and we don't even know what would a dimension fluctuation look like in the cosmic microwave
background. I mean, the, the most extreme thing that would be, yeah, this is a good physics
question, right? It's, it's, this is where, you know, there's sort of an underlying model, but
there's a whole, you know, big tower of actual physics that has to be done to connect it to
experimental observations. And I, you know, one of the things that's cautionary tale again from
history, you know, if, if the bending of light around the sun from general relativity had been
measured in 1616, in 1916, as, as it was originally sort of might have been, Einstein had the wrong
results at that point. And it was only later. Before then, so, you know, 1914, I guess, probably,
right? When the teams went out to measure the prediction of 1911 or something, that he had
the wrong equations that had the measurement. In fact, those astronomers, they got arrested as
they went into Russia, right? And that's why they had their equipment, you know, confiscated.
But you're right. Had they done the measurement, Einstein would have been in the uncomfortable
position of crying wolf in 19, a little bit later, because this first predict would have been false.
Right. But, but, but so it's always, you know, the, going from an underlying theory to a
measurable prediction, it was a challenge. And I, you know, one of the things that,
that is sort of a bizarre possibility is, you know, the phenomenon of gravitational lensing,
where, you know, you have a massive thing and you've got, you know, light being bent on either side,
and you can see, you know, you can, in, you know, you get these two different images of the same
galaxy from different sides of gravitational lens. Now, the possibility is if there was a fractional
dimensional gravitational lens, what might happen is, we don't know if this happens, but it would
be cool if it did, that the image of the galaxy is shattered, so to speak, into lots of little,
sort of, fractal pieces, and that if we could get the right transform, we'd just say to, you know,
our space telescope friends, take this image of the sky, apply this transform to it, and
you'll reconstruct those pixels and you'll get images of galaxies. That would be, that's kind
of the fantasy version of, of, of what, you know, how you would detect a dimension fluctuation,
and, you know, it'll be more difficult than that, but that's the type of thing that we like to be
able to figure out. Now, you know, one of the questions that comes up in all of this is, okay,
are there lots of parameters, are there lots of knobs and switches and so on in these models?
For our models, there's just one, which is the elementary length. What is that? What is,
we have two atoms of space and they have a relation between them. What is the translation
between that distance defined by that relation and the thing we measure with meter rules and so on?
I mean, it sounds very, it sounds very string theoretic in that way. I mean, I mean, the one
parameter that we have, of course, is the, you can frame it in many ways, the string tension,
the string length, or the square root of alpha prime, however you want to frame it, but it really
is this one parameter that you put into the story. And for your particular case, I gather,
you just leave it as a free parameter. We've tried to estimate it, okay, so I don't know,
have a very hokey estimate. Is that how you got your 10 to the 400 that you mentioned early on?
Because that felt to me like I would have said more like 10 to the 200 if I was thinking about
plank lengths and plank volumes in the observable universe. Yeah, so our elementary length is
certainly significantly smaller than the plank length. Right. So it's, you know, more like 10 to
the minus 90 meters, rather than 10 to the minus 34 meters. But why? Where in the world do you even
get that notion that it's smaller than the same range from? So roughly, that roughly what happens
is in our models, there's a factor that occurs, which is the number of essentially parallel threads
of history that exist in the universe. And that number is pretty big, you know, maybe it's 10 to
the 120 or something. And essentially, that number is you end up dividing the plank, plank,
you know, units by that kind of number. And so, for example, one of the mysteries in plank units
is why the plank energy is so big. The plank energy is the energy of a lightning bolt or something,
which seems very non, you know, elementary. I like the thing that is a mass of a dust
moat. But yes, I'm sure they're similar in some way. Right. But, but so the, you know, in our
models, the elementary energy is actually very small. And it's, you know, this question of how
big is the elementary length, the elementary length, the elementary time, the elementary energy,
they're all related by standard plank units. So there's really only one parameter. Now, you know,
that parameter, it's a question of are we going to be in luck in having that parameter be something
that can be measured in our lifetime, so to speak. You know, when people were talking about molecules,
it might have been that theoretically atoms and molecules exist. But, you know, it might not have
been the case that there was a phenomenon like Brownian motion that allowed people to say, yes,
we can actually see the effect under a microscope of those individual molecules. By the way Brownian
motion was discovered, I think in the 1830s, long before its interpretation as revealing
the fact that it was showing individual molecules was not hanging into things. Sure. Right. And so,
so the real question is right now, for example, can we detect an analog of Brownian motion in space?
Right. Now, what, what is the sign of Brownian motion of space? That will be a,
this sort of the analog of discreteness of space. And I have a guess, which actually is a very new
guess. So it's a, it's still very fresh from them. And it's, it leads me to a rather bizarre
aphorism, which is back in the 1800s, when people were studying heat. Nobody knew what heat was.
And so people invented this idea of caloric fluid, which was, you know, heat must be this
fluid. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That would be that would flow from this, this place to that. Okay.
So now we have a phenomenon, you know, in, in, in gravity, which is things like dark matter,
we have this, you know, something that causes gravity, but isn't matter that we can see,
see what it is, so to speak. And so my, my aphorism is, you know, dark matter is the caloric of our
time. And what I mean by that is people say, what could dark matter be? Well, what is matter?
Matter is made of particles. Let's go look for particles that make up this dark matter.
Just like back in the 1800s, people said, what could heat be? It must be a fluid. Let's go
study the properties of this fluid. My guess, my current guess, and this is a,
this very new guess. So this is like a, this is the first time I mentioned this guess anywhere
other than, you know, sort of to myself, so to speak, is my current, my guess, not yet worked out,
is that dark matter is the kind of space time analog of heat. And what do I mean by that? I mean
that the structure of space, just like heat is really the microscopic motion of molecules,
that in a sense, this thing that produces gravity, but does not, does not have the,
the characteristics of, of, of standard matter is a feature of the structure of space. And in
particular, when you look at, for example, that simulation of black holes, what you could see
in the background there was the knitting together of the structure of space. That was a bunch of
spacetime heat. The space wouldn't exist were it not for the fact that the atoms of space are all
interacting in these ways and so on. That is what makes space. The question is, is there a,
is there a, an effective temperature, so to speak, to that, you know, is there, is there a sort of
an activity level and so on to that. And I think, you know, this is the question of what are the,
the effective equations for the, the, you know, for the structure of that kind of spacetime heat.
So this is a, this is, you're hearing this for the, this is a very uncooked, even though uncooked
idea. It's an interesting idea. I mean, obviously the one thing I would stress to the audience is
that there are indirect signatures that the dark matter plays by the rules of matter,
just that it doesn't reflect light or emit light, but I agree. We've been searching
for dark matter particles for a long time and we haven't actually been able to find one that we can
class or manage. What you say plays by the rules of matter. What you're saying is that
its gravitational effects are, you know, it has gravitational effects. I mean,
and it has inertia and things like that. And the way that it exerts or doesn't exert pressure
seems to comport with our understanding of how ordinary matter exerts or does not exert
pressure for instance. So it's a little bit more than, than just that. But, but yes, I can't sit
here and nobody can say what the dark matter is, but how would you distinguish dark matter and dark
energy? Then is dark energy also a feature of the structure of space? Probably. I mean, you know,
again, this is, these are what we have as a, as a kind of a, you know, we have a paradigmatically
different way of thinking about space. And knowing what the consequences of that are is not trivial.
And, you know, I think that one of the things that given, for example, that we had a paradigmatic
way, a different way of thinking about matter, namely that's made of molecules, then one had
ideas like that heat could be microscopic feature of the motion of molecules and so on.
And so similarly, now that we have a different paradigmatic idea about the structure of space,
we get to ask all these questions. And, and for instance, and, you know, the questions that I
suppose are the most pressing as far as I'm concerned are, you know, how do we actually know,
how do we know that we know what we're talking about? You know, how do we get sort of, for example,
sort of bizarre, completely unexpected phenomena that we go out and look for and they're actually
there. And that that's, you know, that that's what that's when you feel really good about theories
is when I mean, to me, what's made me feel really good about this theory is that everything just
seems to line up, it seems to fall into place. It's like, I didn't understand how this worked.
And now I do. Actually, one thing we should talk about is quantum mechanics.
Yeah, I'd love to get to that. But before we do, just kind of press you on that point a little bit.
So you showed us an animation a little while ago, starting with, you know, a very simple
structure like a node. And presumably behind the scenes, there was some rule for updating and
take this node and replace it by two nodes that are connected in some way and so forth.
So do you have a very specific rule for updating a graph, which is the rule that gives rise to,
you know, features like general relativity on some aggregate scale?
No. And that's the that's the whole point, in a sense. This is what I wondered about. It's like,
okay, we're looking for the rule. And then one day we might say, gosh, we got the rule and we
hold it up and we say, this is the rule for our universe. And then the next question is, well,
why did we get this rule and not some other rule? And that really confused me for quite a long time.
Until I understood this idea of the Ruliad, which is the idea that all possible rules are
being used, and that we are merely seeing a slice of that.
Right. But I'm saying we beings, we computationally bounded beings whose processing is so slow compared
to the speed of, is there a rule that we beings are somehow focused upon from the language that
you're using? Yeah, I mean, there'll be some, my guess is there's a class of such rules. So for
example, let's do the analogy in fluid dynamics. Yeah, equations of fluid dynamics work for water
as well as for air, even though the structure of water molecules and air molecules is completely
different. And that's, it's the same thing here that there are, we already know this. I mean,
there are many different underlying rules that inevitably for observers like us have these
characteristics. So now if you ask, you know, depending on what kind of question you ask,
if you're asking questions about air and water, there's certain detailed questions you might ask,
which will distinguish molecular structure of those two materials. And so similarly here,
there's something where presumably, as we become more precise about what kind of observer we are,
we will home in on saying, oh, it's this rule that we're attributing the behavior of the
universe to rather than that one. But that's, you know, I think what we've, what we've observed is
that there are, you know, there are at least wide classes of rules that have this characteristic,
just like there are statistical mechanics of, of leading to sort of the, the kind of behavior
that we, that we expect to see, so to speak. So for example, the rule for that picture of the,
of the merging black holes is not the same rule as they used for the other picture.
Slightly different rule, but it's a, they're both incredibly simple rules. And, you know,
the one for the black hole merger could have been that same rule, but then we would have had to just
it, as you correctly observed, setting up the initial conditions for that is not trivial,
as it isn't trivial for the Einstein equations either. And it's just, you know, the technical
difficulty of doing that was made easier by choosing a particular rule to look at rather than,
rather than that other rule. But again, not to get too far in the weeds. Are there
particular rules that say give you Einstein's equations plus say a higher order derivative
expansion where you maybe have curvature squared or curvature to the fourth terms where other set
of rules don't do that? I mean, is it, is it that level of precision between?
Eventually, yeah, eventually you will get that just as if you look at fluid flow and you look at,
for example, hypersonic flow, eventually you see down to the molecules and then it matters
what the molecules are like. And so we can't distinguish. So you give, you know, at the
level of general relativity, we can't distinguish when we're looking at the higher order corrections
and that, you know, by the way, the, the, the downer about the higher order corrections is
the scale that determines the importance is the elementary length. So when we're looking at
or the elementary energy or whatever else. So if we're looking at something that's 100
orders of magnitude bigger than the elementary length, those effects are pretty small.
We have a something of a hope that in critical black holes, black holes, you know, whether,
whether the, the, the effective sort of, I hate to call it angular momentum because it's, it's all,
it's all such a fake in black holes, the spinning of black holes, but you probably have a better
way to explain this. But, but the, you know, the parameter that determines essentially the
rotation rate of black holes, yes, the, you know, at the critical, you know, at the
J equals M critical black hole point, what happens in our models, which is pretty cute,
is the essentially a piece of the universe is hanging by a causal thread to other parts of
the universe. So if you were to increase above that, you would essentially break off a piece of
the universe. And so what happens right at that point is that the sort of the piece of
the universe that might break off is attached by only a small number of causal edges. And so
there's the possibility that there will be sort of the effect of discreteness will show up in
that case. And for example, sort of lumpiness in the gravitational radiation emitted by black
holes in that state, things like this, because one is sort of, it's like having a gravitational
microscope where you've, you've pulled things apart right to the point where you're kind of
seeing down to the underlying structure of space. But again, that these are, these are all, you
know, the question of when, and when it comes to effects like that, yes, they absolutely depend
on the specific rule that you're using. But when you're looking at the overall black hole,
you know, the merger of two big black holes, it doesn't make any difference just as it doesn't
make difference in the case of flow dynamics. Right. So let's turn then having beaten
a way at Einstein's equations in general relativity for a while here. If we turn to
quantum mechanics, you know, quantum mechanics is of course, in many ways, a sloppy or messy
subject compared to the pristine beauty of the general theory of relativity. It certainly took
a lot of hands over many years to put together what ultimately we're going to be celebrating,
I guess, 100th anniversary in 2025, 2026, you know, Schrodinger's equation, Heisenberg's matrix
mechanics, wherever you wanted data. But there's a lot in quantum mechanics today that many of us,
well, I should say some of us are not particularly comfortable with. We have the issues of the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. We have the question of the interpretation of
quantum mechanics. So when we talk about quantum mechanics, obviously, I'm so deeply interested
to hear your approach. But also, maybe at the outset, you can tell us, will it give us any
insight into the questions that are still furring the brows of quantum mechanisms who think about
the foundations of quantum mechanics worldwide? Yeah, I think so. I mean, you know, I feel more
comfortable with quantum mechanics. I almost think that I understand quantum mechanics.
My friend Dick Feynman, who'd worked on quantum mechanics his whole life, was very fond of saying
nobody understands quantum mechanics. And I think I am getting closer to the point where I can say
I actually understand quantum mechanics. So let me explain what I think I understand. I mean,
so, you know, we talked about, you know, what's the universe made of? It's made of this giant
network. And this network is getting updated. And these little rewrites are happening.
One of the things that you can ask is there's a rule that says how to do these rewrites.
The question is, is there a unique way that these rewrites can happen,
given a particular state of the universe? And the answer is no. There are many possible
orderings, many possible different, you can say, I'm going to do this update now, and then I'm going
to do this update, I'm going to do that update first and so on. There are many different
orderings for those updating. And each of those different orderings defines a different
microscopic history of the universe. So in a sense, what you have is you can have a state of
the universe, you can have two different possibilities for how you update it, they lead to two different
branches of history, somewhat less obviously, they can also be something where you have two
different states of the universe. And when you rewrite them, they end up being in the same state.
You can have this branching, merging structure that you get. And we call these things multi-way
graphs. And actually, it's turned out that after we sort of discovered that they're relevant for
physics, we've been finding multi-way graphs everywhere. And in fact, the very fact that
they seem to describe some aspects of physics, we've been able to export ideas from physics
to a whole bunch of other fields, like mathematics, like distributed computing,
maybe like biology, all kinds of areas. So it's been really interesting to see that this structure
of so many things can happen, many things can happen, you have branching and merging.
Give it a very simple example. You play a game like tic-tac-toe and you start with a
board in a particular state. Now you can make one move or you can make another move. And you
can build up this graph, this game graph of all the possible moves that you can make in tic-tac-toe
and eventually somebody wins, somebody loses. But there's this graph and sometimes there can be
different moves you make, which end up with the same state of the board, even though the moves
were different. So it's kind of this picture of many branches of time that are happening
in the universe. And so then the question, the idea of quantum mechanics ends up being
kind of you're looking at those many branches of history. And when you ask a question like,
well, okay, so let's speak and we can go in different directions in quantum mechanics. But
one question is, what is the observer of quantum mechanics? What does the observer do? Well, the
thing you have to realize is the observer is embedded in the system. So the observer's mind
is also branching and merging. So quantum mechanics becomes this bizarre story of what
does a branching and merging mind believe is happening in a branching and merging universe?
And this is where this idea that we are persistent in time becomes critical. Because if we were just
flowing through all those branchings and mergings, we wouldn't have a view that we are, we wouldn't
have this idea that we have a definite experience through time. But as soon as we assert ourselves,
we're having a definite experience in time, we have to kind of conflate many of these branches
of history. And the fact that it is consistent to do that as a non-trivial thing you have to show
is the case. And the extent to which we see the effects of there being many branches is essentially
the essence of seeing that there are quantum effects. That's kind of a very rough picture.
I mean, I can't help but jump in as I suspect many who are watching this would think as well and
again, disabuse me. It feels like Everett, it feels like the many worlds of quantum mechanics.
Is it just that or is there something different?
I don't think so. I think the big thing that those guys didn't have was merging. And I think
merging is really important. No, no, no, you can definitely have merging. I mean, if you do, you
know, double slit experiments and you're superposing the distinct trajectories, I think merging
is definitely part of that story too. Well, no, I think the, well, I don't know, this is,
I'm always really bad about, you know, okay, so my way of talking about other people's theories
tends to be this. I either really do the history and try and understand in great detail what actually
happened or I think I have nothing to say. And this is a case where I really have not done the
history. So I don't really know. Sure. Okay. But my impression is the kind of the popular version
of many worlds tends to be kind of our consciousness could flow on one of these possible branches.
And it is sort of arbitrary which branch we're on. And that's kind of why we see things probabilistically.
That's kind of not a picture in again, it may not be fruitful to go down this, but I think
many Everettians would say that our consciousness itself divides and flows along distinct trajectories.
And in some sense, the probabilities, which is a very subtle question, emerge because
somehow there's a greater measure, a greater weight placed on our consciousness observing
one outcome versus another. And this is a great deal of controversy and how you define that measure
and, you know, how to really operationally make sense of probabilities in a universe where everything
happens. But yes, I think that would be closer to the spirit of an Everettian. Yeah, but so I think
maybe the difference here is that we're talking about sort of a, you know, the observer as an
extended object in what we call branchial space. The observer spans the individual mind spans
many different branches of history. And so it's not that, and the individual mind, which believes
that it has a single thread of experience, spans many branches of history, and is having to make,
you know, is having to enforce consistency conditions to say, yes, it's really true that
there's just one thread of experience. And it's not, it's non trivial to establish all those
consistency conditions and make sure that they work out, so to speak. And how do you do that?
I mean, how do you impose those consistency? Is that just from a rule from the outside,
where you say I need to impose? Interesting question. Okay, so this is,
we don't know all of this. In fact, I'm just a thing that I'm just writing right now is about
what I call observer theory, which is an attempt to have sort of an idealized version of what an
observer does, just as things like Turing machines are idealized versions of what computers do.
And the fundamental thing that observers do is the equivalence things. You know,
there's all the complexity of the world. And the observer is taking some sort of digest of all
that complexity in the world and stuffing it into a finite mind. That's basically what you
look at all kinds of different observers. And it's, it's non trivial. So for example,
in the case of gases, you can say an observer could be a piston that's measuring the pressure
in the gas. And there are lots of different particular molecular impacts that could happen.
But to the piston, all it cares about is the aggregate of all those impacts and how the piston
is going to be pushed. And it's a matter of physics that the piston has a, you know,
there's a, it's a much more rigid object. And so even though every time a molecule hits it,
it deforms a bit as kind of, so, so you can kind of, but, but the big idea of observers is the
equivalence things. And it's a little bit confusing because in quantum mechanics, the, the big, oh,
I measured that, that bit, that qubit or whatever, it's very much more like a, it's the different
kinds of measurement. And really, I think about two kinds. One is things that aggregate stuff.
And the other is things like weighing balances, where it's either heavier on one side or heavier
on the other side. And a lot of what's done in kind of the quantum information style of quantum
mechanics is more like weighing balances than it is like the kind of the aggregate thing. What,
what people do when they extract chemistry out of quantum mechanics and say, yes, we really have a
water molecule that really has this shape, even though quantum mechanics is talking about lots
of different shapes, that's more of the aggregation kind of kind of measurement. Yeah. This, this
question of, of what kind of, okay, so what is the dynamics of measurement? In our models,
there certainly is an underlying dynamics to measurement, the cost of measurement, so to
speak. We don't really know how that works yet. In fact, I'm literally just the, the section right
up on my computer is called the cost of observation. So it's, it's the, the, but what we can roughly
see is this, there are, let's say you're trying to make a quantum computer, and you're trying to use
the fact that there are many threads of history, that's kind of what the big idea of a quantum
computer is, you get to sort of run lots of computations in parallel. Yes. The, the, the thing
that's difficult with a quantum computer is reading out the answer and getting, and getting it to fit
in that single thread of experience that we humans have. Yes. Now normally in quantum mechanics,
we just say it's a measurement and it's just sort of a, you know, an instantaneous thing. We don't
talk about how it works. It's just a mathematical construct. In our models, we do get to actually
talk about how do these equivalences get established. We don't have a great model for that yet. We can
say sort of how many elementary operations have to happen to make these equivalences occur. We
can kind of try and count those. And so, for example, if we do start counting those, it's not,
doesn't look good with kind of the formal success of quantum computing. It seems like what you gain
in those many threads of history, you lose in knitting together the threads of history
so that we as humans can conclude that a definite thing happened. So that, that's a,
but, but kind of this, this idea, you know, can we, can we look inside the measurement process?
The answer is a bit, but I'm not happy with how far we've got on that. Presumably you can say with,
with certainty, or correct me if I'm wrong, that you do not have anything like collapse of the
wave function. That is not the way. Yeah. Gosh, it's so hard to say because, because, you know, the
when our observers aggregate sort of different parts of history, I, I don't know how does,
I don't know how to relate that necessarily. Well, do you have unitary, do you have global
unitary? Yes, yes, yes. Then, then it's pretty clear. Yeah. So I suspect that, you know, the,
the old ideas of collapse of the wave function probably are not going to be going to be singled
out in the. Right. So by the way, just to give another piece of what, what's going on. So
we have this multiway graph of all these different parts of history. And one of the things you can
do is say, let's look at what state things got to at a particular time. Let's make a particular
sort of cut through this multiway graph. And then we ask, well, what's, you make that cut,
what's the kind of spatial direction of that cut? We know time is going down. Let's say,
what's across, we call that branch shield space, the space of quantum branches.
And we say it again, what is branch shield space, former times? It's the, it's the, it's,
you make this multiway graph. So imagine you're playing tic-tac-toe, you've got all these different
possible, possible moves you can make. Now you say at a particular time, let's just slice across
all those possibilities. And we've got a bunch of those little ends. This is the move that got
made. Now, what is the coordination of branch shield space? What we tend to do is to say,
what is the common ancestry of those? So we've got two little, you know, states here. We say,
states that were, had a common ancestor one step back, we say those are connected by an edge in
a branch shield graph. And then we look at that large scale branch shield graph. And that gives
us a space, just like we're constructing physical space out of this hypergraph, we construct this
branch shield space. And so then the question is, what's the interpretation of branch shield space?
And okay, our, in certain approximations, our guess is that branch shield that position in
branch shield space is quantum phase. So in other words, what, what in standard quantum mechanics,
one of the things that, you know, one sets up in the mathematics.
You literally mean the phase of a wave function?
I mean the phase of a wave function, the phase of a quantum amplitude. So that, in other words,
that, that what, you know, standard quantum mechanics, you know, complex numbers are a big
thing. And, you know, there's this idea that we don't describe things in terms of probabilities,
we describe in terms of quantum amplitudes, quantum amplitudes are complex numbers.
My guess is that the packaging of sort of magnitude of the, of the, of the quantum amplitude and
phase of the quantum amplitude into a single complex number is the same mistake that Mankowski
made packaging space and time into a single space time object. So my guess is that, that the, the
magnitude is associated with the counting of paths in the multi-way graph and the phase is
associated with the position and branchial space that you end up. So now his work, his work gets
really wild. So now the question is, how do you think about GD6 in these, essentially in the
multi-way graph? You're thinking about kind of shortest paths and you're thinking about,
how do the shortest paths get formed and what deflects the shortest paths? So what, and again,
I'm eliding a bunch of sort of technical detail, not all of which I would say we're,
I consider we've completely nailed down, but the qualitative picture is the presence of energy
momentum deflects these paths in this multi-way graph or effectively in branchial space. And so
what we're saying is that, that energy momentum is sort of moving around where we end up in
branchial space. So in other words, energy momentum is, is changing our quantum phase. And so that,
you know, what, what, and in quantum mechanics, the path integral is precisely saying that the
presence of relativistically invariant, you know, energy momentum, the action is what changes the
quantum phase. And so what we're saying is that, which I find very amazing, is that what in physical
space, gravity is the effect of energy momentum on deflecting GD6 in physical space in the, in
branchial space, the energy momentum deflects, also deflects GD6, but it deflects effectively GD6,
which are associated with position in branchial space. So in other words, what, what in physical
space is gravity deflecting things in, in branchial space is the path integral associated with the
way that energy momentum changes quantum phase? Is it, is it just a technical detail? I mean,
the action is not quite energy, right? Indeed. So indeed. Is that, is that an, that's a technical
detail. I mean, you can, you can, you know, it seems to work out correctly. I mean, it's, it's
this, you know, you get the right sign, you get the right sign, you get the right sign between
yes and potential and yes, I think so. I mean, you know, I will say that, that
the, you know, let me, let me rank the kind of ways in which these derivations have been done.
Physicists have a way of doing derivations, which mathematicians say are hopelessly
un-rigorous. Okay. And, and for example, the derivation of, you know, the gas laws or something
from molecular dynamics, that is hopelessly mathematically un-rigorous. It, it, I think
can be made more rigorous by thinking about computational reducibility and so on. But it's,
it's in the traditional way of doing it. It's, so the thing, the derivations that we have are,
I would say on the slightly more risque end of physicist derivations. Okay. And we are working
hard to fill those in with things that are more mathematician, you know, style derivations. But
that particular thing, I, that particular thing is not an issue because Lagrangian density is what,
why is that? That's because I'd have to think about this. I haven't thought about this for a
while, but, but that particular thing is not an issue. So let me turn to maybe a more conceptual
issue that I'm clear on. Where would something like the Born rule come from? Yeah, good question.
You know, just again for the audience that, you know, Max Born famously 1926 gave us the, what we
believe is the right interpretation of a quantum wave function in terms of what it means for our
observations. You take the norm squared of the wave function or the amplitude, as Steve was saying,
and, and from that you get the probability of getting this or that result. But that sort of
comes from the outside. You know, it's not in the basic equations that, you know, they're the
dynamics of the system. So how does it show up or does it show up? We have arguments, right. We
have arguments for it. I do not think they're mathematically adequate. And actually, we're
just, that's something just one person has been working on. This has just been working on that
and seems to have made some progress in that, that area of being able to sort of rigorously
derive the Born rule. I mean, you can, we can argue for it. But I would say that, that, you know,
we should be able to just outright derive it. And we haven't been able to do that yet.
But let me give an indication of something like the double slit experiment, a typical quantum
experiment of roughly how one thinks about that in these models, because it's a little weird.
So, you know, what happens, you've got this photon, it can go through either one slit or the other.
One of the mysteries is that it can have interference where destructive interference where,
you know, you'd say, well, the photon must have gone through this slit or that slit.
How can it be the case that at some particular place on the screen behind,
there are just no photons arriving? Yeah. Okay. So in our models, what seems to happen is that
these two photons wind up, they, you know, they go through these slits and they wind up at some
place in physical space. They also wind up at some place in branchial space. And both photons go
through slits and they wind up in a particular place in physical space, particular place in
branchial space. And what seems to happen is the following. But I'm sorry, why two photons? I don't
mean to get the, but I mean, I would love you to explain this with one photon. Okay, okay, okay.
We could say one photon that let's, you know, this question of, okay, we could say one photon,
and its, you know, its amplitude, to use the traditional way of thinking about it,
winds up partly in one place in physical space, partly in one place in branchial space. Okay.
So this question of what qualitatively is destructive interference? I think the picture is
this. The observer is an extended but localized sort of thing in branchial space. So it is, it is
observing a piece of branchial space that's, that's extended, but it's finite. But now what ends up
happening, I think, is that these two sort of possibilities for the photon wind up at two
different ends of branchial space. And so an observer who is a bounded observer in branchial
space just says, I don't know what happened to the photon, because I can't, I can't construct a
reality in which I, I see both pieces, so to speak. So, and that's kind of where did the photon go?
Well, it got lost in branchial space. And I mean, that's a very qualitative way to put it.
But can you give me some feel for where I get the interference fringes in the double slit
from, from that description? Yeah, yeah, I mean, okay, so, so you have to dig much deeper into
kind of this mapping between quantum phase and position in branchial space. And as I say,
I mean, this is another one of these things where the mathematics, we have a kind of a hokey
derivation of this, which I'm not satisfied with, in which one does get interference fringes,
but I'm not convinced by it. It's, it's, it's really, it's this question of
the understanding of what branchial space is and how it works is complicated. It's a different kind
of space than people have seen before, kind of understanding how it relates to the Hilbert space
that one sees in quantum mechanics is not, you know, those pieces are not put together.
Right. So, you know, I can give, you know, it is interesting to see in our models,
what I find one of the interesting things is that there are phenomena in physics,
where we can give kind of logical arguments for why they are that way, but we've not been able
to give mechanistic arguments for why they are that way. So for example, another one is time
dilation and relativity. So here's a, here's a way to think about that in our models. So, you know,
the, it's, it's for other people's benefit, I mean, it's more or less the, you know,
things that are going faster, time seems to run slower for them. So in our models, what is, you
know, the running of time is this computational process. So a thing stays in one place and it
computes its next state, next state, next state. Now let's say the thing is moving. In order to move,
it has to reconstruct itself in different places in space. That reconstruction process costs
computational effort. There are computations needed to do that reconstruction of the thing at
different places in space. So what happens is you're using up computation, your computation
budget, repositioning yourself, reconstructing yourself at a different place in space. So you
have less computation budget left over, so to speak, to update yourself in time. And that's the sort
of, in our models, that's the mechanistic explanation of time dilation, which is, to me, I mean, you
know, it's, we can derive time dilation easily by sort of logical arguments, so to speak, but
you get like the right, the right factor. I mean, you get gamma, gamma over the square,
one minus v squared over, absolutely. So you must put in the speed of light, right? I mean,
that certainly is not something that your model gives you from the outset. That's just a ratio,
but there is some ratio that naturally is the speed of the object to the speed of light.
Yes. Yes. And the reason that happens, okay, is when you, in, in space, there's this big network,
but the thing that really matters in space-time is the causal graph that says, this update happened
here, how is it related to some other update that happened? So some updates are time-like related,
in the sense that the next update can't have happened until the previous one has already
happened. Some updates can be space-like, separated, in the sense that they're, you know,
they could happen simultaneously. And so what's happening is, in this causal graph,
effectively, all the causal edges are, in some sense, going at the speed of light.
And these causal edges are, by definition, kind of light-like edges. And so what you're, what
you're looking at is then, then the derivation is actually rather straightforward.
I see. It's just like a geometrical factor, then, at that point between how you slice the,
yes, yes, that's right.
If you don't, can we go back to quantum mechanics?
Yes.
Because there was a question there. Do you have any means by which you take the classical limit of,
I mean, because, you know, the, if I understood correctly, the starting point for getting to a
quantum description was this fact that you could have these different branches from applying your
rules, say, in different orders. I don't see how you sort of continuously get rid of that,
which is normally how we think of getting to the classical limit. You know, we have this
idea of h bar goes to zero, which is a weird idea since h bar is actually dimensionful,
but we can make sense of it. So, how do you take that limit?
Right. So, I mean, it's the same thing as in space. So, you know, getting to, in space,
there's this, it's a question of how big is the observer relative to the elementary length in
space? And so, similarly here, how big is the observer in branchial space relative to kind of
these elementary sort of distances between branches? And so, h bar is roughly, I mean,
qualitatively, not some, is roughly just as the speed of light is associated with, you know, given,
okay, so given a certain amount of time, given one elementary time, how far did the causal
edge go in one elementary time? Answer, it went the speed of light times the elementary time.
High definition. Right. And so, roughly, it's the same kind of thing that after one elementary time,
the branchial edges are roughly h bar away from each other in branchial space.
Okay. So, by the way, that means that in the way our model is set up, just as there's a speed of
light that governs the maximum rate of information, which information can propagate in physical space,
there is an analogous quantity, the maximum entanglement speed, that is the maximum speed
that information can propagate in branchial space. And that's a new thing that hasn't been
a story in quantum mechanics before. And that's a thing which we are kind of wondering whether,
when, for example, black holes merge, whether there is a sort of the rate of merging is partly
limited by the speed of light and partly limited by the maximum entanglement speed.
And so, we don't know. Again, as I said, there's this one parameter in our model,
so elementary length, elementary time, or maximum entanglement speed. You can pick any of these.
We don't know the maximum entanglement speed. But that's another thing that, for example,
limits the rate at which black holes can merge, that quantum black holes can merge.
But does it also, again, maybe I'm again interpreting it too much at face value,
but if we have a typical case of an entangled pair, are you saying that if I measure the spin of
particle 2, say, would have the opposite spin in the canonical setup, but somehow there's a
propagation speed, which is to do with this entanglement speed? Yes, but it's not in physical
space. Sure, I understand that, yeah. Yeah, right. So there's a, I mean, these are good questions,
and this is sort of stuff we're actively trying to figure out. I mean, in other words, there's a
bunch of these kind of quantum constructions of CH, SH, whatever it is, these sort of
quantum correlation constructions. The question is, how do those work in our models,
and can we find a sort of a physical way in which in some quantum many-body system or something,
we can actually measure a maximum entanglement speed? We haven't figured that out yet.
And so where would you put the goal? I mean, for instance, back in the 80s, the goal of a string
theorist like me and many of my colleagues back then, we envision that we have this approach to
physics that really only has one parameter in it, the string tension, the string length,
and we envision one day being able to calculate from first principles things like the mass ratios
of the elementary particles, the coupling strengths of how these particles influence each other and
how the various forces of nature act on these particles. As the years went by, we began to
modify our view of what was likely achievable, because even though the fundamental theory didn't
have any knobs in it to tune, when we began to look at things like the theory had extra dimensions
and then needed to be compactified to a smaller scale, we began to see knobs and things that we
could vary entering in the theory through the precise shape and size of the extra dimensions
and various adornments which those extra dimensional spaces supported. Where are you? Do you envision
that this Earl-like computational view to how reality functions will, in principle, predict the
mass ratios of the electron to the muon one day? I mean, where's the ambition and where do you think
you are in that process? Yeah, I think the answer is yes, it will predict it. But it will predict it
for observers like us. And by the way, even in traditional quantum field theory, the mass of
the electron depends on the observer. In other words, the mass of an electron dependent in the
renormalization group, for example. Oh, you mean in terms of the energy scale at which you measure
it? Is that what you mean? Yeah, exactly. I mean, you measure the mass of the electron by kicking
the electron a certain amount and that gives you the mass and the amount you kick it
depends on, it gives you a different mass. And there's quantum field theory once being able
to calculate that running mass, so to speak. So it's, we already know that there is observer
dependence to these things. But we probably have a good enough character, it probably,
we have a good enough characterization of us as observers that I think my expectation is,
yes, these things will be computable for observers like us. And, and I think, you know, in, so let
me give you some predictions about this is meta predictions about models. So, you know, for example,
I think black holes and particles are going to turn out to be incredibly closely related,
and may even be pretty much the same thing. That is that the, which is kind of, you know,
they're both kind of defects in the structure of spacetime. And, you know, they've come from
very different places in general relativity, and then kind of the ways we've thought about particles.
But that's, that's one possibility. I think that this question of, you know, for example, in,
in quantum field theory, in the standard model of particle physics and things,
we have this local gauge invariance idea, this idea of, you know, what, what leads to sort of
fundamental forces and so on, local gauge invariance looks, it looks fairly clear how that
will emerge in our models. The question is, I mean, like, like compact league groups naturally?
Yes. Yes. So, so just like the limits of this hypergraph is, okay, so when we think about this
hypergraph, we think about, you know, all the different nodes in the hypergraph, and we can say
these nodes in the hypergraph are at a certain spatial distance apart, we can attribute some
spatial distance between them. But inside that hypergraph is bundled up all the internal degrees
of freedom, as well as the external, as well as kind of the physical space, there is also
internal degrees of freedom. So what we have to do, more technically, we're dealing with,
you know, can we distinguish the base space and the fibers in a fiber bundle?
That's what I was about to ask you. Yeah. Okay.
Right. So, so the issue is, and we've got toy models of this, where we can sort of distinguish
the aspects of the hypergraph that are the base space, the physical space,
versus the aspects of the fibers, the internal degrees of freedom.
Presumably, you actually really need sheet theory, I would imagine, if you're doing this.
Yes. Yes. And it very, I mean, one of the things that's fun with this is I had never really understood
category theory before that, you know, really working on this, and we need the most limiting
case of kind of higher category theory. I mean, this really odd object is deeply related
to things that Grossendijk studied in the so-called infinity groupoid. And it's very lovely that
these things are, I mean, one of the things that to me is exciting about the things we're doing
is that, you know, it's one thing would be, oh, is string theory right? Are we right?
You know, these are two different kind of poles, but I don't think that's the way it is at all.
I think that most of the theories in mathematical physics that have been well-developed
have something useful to say. And, you know, we may have a machine code that is a thing from which,
into which these can all be attached, but it isn't the case that it's like, oh, that was the wrong
track. It's like, and that same thing is happening with some of these sort of higher mathematical
concepts. But do you see any evidence of things like, you know, SU3 cross SU2 cross U1? I mean,
this is the question that just like, okay, so let me explain. In our big graph, you can say, oh,
there are these, there's kind of this spatial extent. Now you can ask, what about, for example,
rotational invariance? You're at a particular place in the graph, and you say, if I were to rotate
things, would I have something that looks the same? Well, that's a graph theoretical question,
because you can say, you've got one graph that's here, and then I've got another graph that's kind
of at an angle, and I can ask, can I match up those two graphs? Can I make a graph transformation
where I'm re-retangling the graph, but it's still the same graph? Okay, so automorphism of the graph.
And so the question then becomes, sort of, just like we've said, oh, in the limit, this graph
behaves like a manifold or something, we can ask, when we're looking at these rotation-like things,
is the limit of that something like a Lie group, something like a continuous group?
And so the thing we don't know is, just like we can't derive the number three for the dimensions
of space, it is, I think, conceivable. I'm not saying it will happen this way. I think it's
conceivable that for a wide class of models that everything will be a subgroup of E8 or something,
that it will necessarily be the case that the thing we derive as being that internal Lie group
degree of freedom, so to speak, has to have certain characteristics. I don't know that
that's the case, but I think the things we're seeing so far make it not completely crazy
that that would be the case. Make it E8 cross E8, and then we have definite resonance with
Yes, yes, yes. Well, I mean, we just don't know. This is one of these things where you're kind
of, you know, the thing that is both exciting and kind of humbling is, you know, the model
is right there. Now we just have to do the hard work of figuring out what its consequences are,
and if it turns out the consequences are crazy and don't agree with what we observe physically,
then we're out of luck. But I have to say, at this point, I don't think that's going to happen,
because too much has happened. How many people are working? Is it you and a small team?
Well, I mean, locally we have this thing we call Wolfram Institute, which is a small group of
people, but there's a wider collection of people who worked on different aspects of this. And I
think that the, I mean, I don't know, I haven't counted, because it's not really a, I mean,
there's a small inner group, so to speak, which is a modest number of people. But there's, you know,
and there's a certain amount of bridge work that's been done to whether it's to categorical
quantum mechanics, or to other kinds of fields where people are like, well, you know, we're
really working on categorical quantum mechanics, but we're doing it in the context of the connections
to this model. So it's some, I mean, I think the kind of, you know, the way physics tends,
well, I don't know, physics, I've been out of physics as a, I haven't been professionally doing
physics in 40-something years, but it used to be the case. I happened to be lucky enough to work
on physics, you know, in the late 1970s, when it was having kind of a golden age of the sort of
arrival of quantum field theory, and then subsequently cosmology, which I was quite involved in. And,
you know, that was the kind of the, my sort of feeling for the,
at that time, there was this great tendency for everybody, you know, some new thing would happen
and every physics would, yes, right. And I think, you know, that would be nice if that,
if that, you know, more people, the thing about what we're doing is that, you know, some of it
is very paradigmatically similar to mathematical physics. Some of it really plugs into mathematical
physics, but quite a lot of it does not. Quite a lot of it is more like distributed computing,
you know, mathematical logic, just, you know, computer experimentation, things like this.
And it is somewhat paradigmatically different. And also, I would say that, that, you know,
this is what I get for having spent 40 years building tools. The tools we have are pretty,
you know, streamlined and efficient. And there's a lot of things where it's pretty easy for me,
given those tools, to jump pretty far relative to what people are used to doing and kind of the
steps that they take in doing mathematical physics and so on. So that makes it, you know,
there's a lot of kind of alien stuff that gets made possible by that. And that I think makes it,
you know, in a sense, I've been sort of, you know, as time goes on, that, you know,
the tower that we're building gets a bit taller and it gets a bit more difficult to kind of,
you know, when people sort of get involved, we do the summer school and winter school about
this project. And, you know, that's sort of, it's getting challenging to fit kind of the what we
know so far into a few weeks of lectures. And that's, you know, I think that that's kind of,
but, you know, to me, you know, the more people we can get involved, the better. Right now, I mean,
one of the frustrating things is there are a lot of experimental physicists who are like,
we've got a telescope, we've got a particle accelerator, you know, we would like to look
for something unusual and interesting, just tell us what to look for. And we're still in the situation
where we're like, we don't really know yet. Hey, we've been in that position in string theory for
quite some time. So you see, but this is this is why we need to make the right bridge to string
theory, because we want to make use of everything you guys have figured out. And maybe you'll find
what we figured out useful. I think one of the things that's been exciting for me about about
this project is that, for example, I said, they'll be, you know, people said, what are you working on?
I said fundamental theory of physics, people say, oh, that doesn't sound very practical. And I'm like,
yeah, you know, it might have applications in 200 years. And the surprise to me is that I was
wrong about that. There are actually applications now to distributed computing, because the model
that we have of the structure of spacetime is basically a model that you can think of as events
happening and so on. And that is, you can think of that as being a big distributed computation.
And so the ways that we have to think about spacetime now becomes ways to think about now
become ways to think about distributed computing. We're starting to think about, you know,
programming in a certain reference frame, things like this. So we're importing by using the fact
that we have a common formalism, we're able to start importing successes from physics into other
areas. And so to my surprise, there actually seem to be some pretty near term applications of not
so much the physics side of this, but the bridge that's made to physics from the kinds of things
we're doing. Yeah. Well, I can make you a pledge right now for whatever it's worth. You correctly
calculate the electron to muon mass ratio, and I will drop everything that I'm doing.
And that's going to be a challenging one. Give me something, you know, I've, you know, the time
when we can see what the, you know, it's, you know, getting 206 is, you know, I'm not counting on that
being soon. I have to say, some things about these models have just dropped much more easily,
like the idea of what energy is. I thought that was going to be a long hard, I thought this whole
thing was going to be a maybe we could talk about what happens in the first 10 to the minus 100
seconds of the universe, but we'd never have things to say about kind of things that are more
obviously connected to sort of current reality. And I think the other thing that's been a very
interesting surprise is this fact that the methods we're developing are practically useful to people
who are doing things like numerical relativity. That's, that's a thing. I didn't, I didn't know
that, that, that is true. I mean, the numerical. Yeah. Yeah, that seems to be, I mean, I don't
know, we've been Jonathan Gorat, who's one of the people working on this, who's been, has been
traveling around talking to numerical relativity groups who are starting to use software that
he's produced that is based on our models. So that's a, that's encouraging. And, you know, I think,
I think that's some, so yes, electron muon mass ratio, I'm not counting on that one anytime soon.
Right. You know, I might get you an E8. I think an E8 would already be impressive enough.
Well, you know, because of the classification of compact Lie groups, again, the small number
in some sense of truly distinct ones that are out there, I don't know if that would
grab me as fully as it may grab others. But I can't help but make one comment,
which is you noted that in your approach, the relate, there may be a relationship between
black holes and, and elementary particles. That would be interesting. I don't know if you're
aware of it, but a paper that I wrote with Andy Strominger and Dave Morrison some years ago,
we found something of exactly that sort we found in string theory, that if you have certain shapes
manifold to the extra dimensions, and you take a particular sub space within it, like a sphere,
and you collapse it down to a sufficiently small size, it can look like a black hole for most of
that motion. But when you actually collapse it right down to zero, there's a smoothing of the
space in which that black hole turns into an elementary particle. So there's, yeah, so there's
a direct link that we found through certain kind of deformations of the extra dimensions. That was
a direct link between black holes and elementary particles. So again, whether that has an incarnation
in anything that that your approach is, you know, it just certainly jumped out to be when you said
that. That's very cool. I didn't know that. I mean, I think the, it's, it's, it's funny because,
you know, I knew the physics of 1980 or so pretty well. Yeah. And then I've been kind of in, in,
in, you know, it's like a cryonic freezing for where I was only partly paying attention for a
long time. But no, I mean, that that that type of result, it's interesting. And that's, you know,
that's exactly why one should try to make a better bridge between our models and string theory,
because one might be able to see, you know, how that really, you know, flushes out. And, you know,
in our models, and then in string theory, see how that really, you know, this, this extra dimensions
thing is going to, I don't know, we'll see. But I think this idea that you're kind of lifting out
of this hypergraph, both the spatial direction and internal degrees of freedom, I think is,
you know, I don't know how related that is. But I think that's going to wind up being,
you know, I mean, it's, that, that has a certain, I don't know, there's a certain
colluciclinus or something to the whole, you know, to that whole kind of way of thinking about
things. But, but I would, I, that will be my, my guess for how that will, how that will end up
working out. And that, that in fact, you know, again, that, that one will, you know, if, if,
you know, I, as I say, I, I think that the thing that to me is really interesting is,
it's not like, in my view, you know, there's sort of a, a sense of where mathematical physics has
gone. And I just don't think I think that there's been, I mean, it's kind of analogous, I suppose,
to what happened in the early days of computation where people had different models of computation,
and then Turing machines came along, and that was kind of a way of, of anchoring a bunch of
different kinds of ideas. And then you could take these, these models that have been often much
more difficult to understand, and you had kind of this pretty mechanistic way of thinking about them,
and you could build a whole lot of stuff from it. So I'm kind of, that's my, that's my qualitative
view about what, what I think can happen. And it's, it's a, it's wonderfully exciting stuff. And I
think as we all know, if you're going to shoot for the stars, you've got to be willing to fail
miserably. And so you have to be bold. And so you're certainly being bold, and it'd be fascinating to
see how this develops. So I'd love to check in at some point again, with an update on where things
are. Look, I'd also hope today to speak about, but we'll put it off, hopefully for another
conversation, if you're willing to do so, the whole AI stuff, and consciousness, and free will,
and all those wonderful ideas. But, you know, when you have an opening in your schedule in the
future, it'd be great to connect again. And I'd be, I'd be happy to talk about that. I've got the
this week's fun thought is quantum LL lamps, but we'll leave that. There you go. Okay. So that's
intriguing enough. All right. So, so thank you so much for joining us. And we'll, we'll talk again
at some point in the not too distant future. Yep. Lovely to chat. Great. Thank you. All right.
Everybody that wraps up this live session, which if I'm being completely honest and too much
information, I'm partly wrapping up because I've got to use the facilities and sitting here any
longer will be definitely dangerous. But it's been a wild ride in this conversation with Stephen
Wolfram, as we expected it to be, trying to perhaps find the underlying computational structure to
all the things that we as physicists have for the last hundred years been enamored with,
statistical mechanics, special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory,
and who knows? I mean, the thought that there might be some deeper underlying structure that
allows us to understand where these laws come from and as well tied to the fact that we are the
observers that are aware of these laws. Well, it certainly is bold, big, exciting. Who knows if it
will pan out, but that's the nature of being at the cutting edge. So thanks so much for joining
us for this live conversation. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel or subscribe at worldsciencefestival.com
to be updated on the various programs that we are undertaking. About a week ago,
we released a wonderful conversation on AI. Some of you may have seen it. If you've not,
you should check it out with Jan LeCun, Sebastian Bubeck, and Tristan Harris, where we really
described the inner workings of some of the LLMs that Steve Wolfram just made reference to,
as well as discussed some of the potential dangers or, as some of the programs suggested,
the over-inflated view of those dangers of AI going to the future. We'll be releasing shortly.
I believe our next release will be a program on cosmology that we had at our live events in
September, and please, as well, keep your eye on. We will shortly release a really wonderful
conversation on string theory, the state of string theory that we had at that event with David Groves,
Ed Whitten, Andy Strominger, and myself, really trying to give a feel for where we are. Here we
are 2023. These ideas began in 1968. Where are we in the process of trying to realize the potential
of string theory, and so that program will be released in the not-too-distant future, as well.
All right. I think that's about it on the updates. Again, subscribe to our YouTube channel,
go to worldsciencefestival.com, subscribe to our newsletter, and we will be having a number of
these live conversations going forward. But for now, that's it here from Columbia University.
My office here, this World Science Festival live event. I'm Brian Greene. Thanks for joining us.
