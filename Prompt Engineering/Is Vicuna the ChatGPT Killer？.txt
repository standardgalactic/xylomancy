Since the release of Alpaca met us large language model and the leak of its weight
There has been an explosion of open source models first
We had Alpaca from Stanford group followed by Dolly from Databricks can then a bunch of models from Cerebrus and
Most recently GPT for all from Nomek AI
But there's a new model which claims to be as good as chat GPT. It's called Kubek Kunya
It's an open source chatbot that claims to be 90% of chat GPT's quality
They have used a very interesting training data set and evaluation strategy
It's more on that in a minute in this video
We are going to do a one-to-one comparison between chat GPT and Wacunya on these tasks just a spoiler alert
It's very impressive
So watch till the end for detailed comparison
Before looking at the model and how to use it and potentially how you can retrain it by accessing its weights
Let's look at how it was trained
So Wacunya has a 13 billion parameters and it's trained by fine-tuning
Lama on user shared conversations collected from shared GPT
Now if you don't know what shared GPT is it's a website where people can share the chat GPT conversations
So if you go to share GPT.com
They have an introductory video, but I would encourage you to actually look at these examples that people have shared
So for example, here is an example conversation that this person had with chat GPT
You can learn a lot about prompt engineering just by studying these examples
A shared GPT has a Chrome extension and you can install this and share your own conversation with the community as well
So this team of researcher
collected data from shared GPT and
fine-tuned the Lama model on that data set
And I think that is why it is performing as good as chat GPT because it's specifically trained on a data
Collecting from chat GPT right before looking at the evaluation. Let's look at the training data set
So in this case, they have collected
70,000 conversations from shared GPT and it was trained on eight a 100 GPUs for one day
So to convey Wacunya with different models what they have done is they selected 80 diverse questions and then
used GPT4 to judge the output of these different models including Lama, Alpaca
Chat GPT and Wacunya. We will look at the evaluation in a minute
But let's first look at the comparison between different models
So in terms of data set Lama was trained on one trillion tokens
Alpaca is trained on 52,000 samples and Wacunya is trained on 70,000 samples
In terms of training code, Alpaca and Wacunya code is available. Lama's code is not available
Now for evaluation Lama used academic benchmarks
Alpaca is using authors evaluation and Wacunya is using GPT4 assessment. In terms of cost
for their 7 billion parameter model
the training cost was around $140 and
for 13 B-parameter models it's only $300
Now keep in mind in this case they didn't really had the
training data cost because they were simply using shared GPT API to get the training data
So Alpaca has a maximum context length of 512 whereas in this case they increase it to
2048 which also substantially increases their GPU memory requirement
That's why you need a lot of B-fair GPU to actually use this
But they also did some memory optimizations on top of it. It is very interesting to look at their evaluation strategy
So they came up with eight different strategies including Fermi problems, role-play scenarios, writing, coding and math tasks
Then they used GPT4 to actually generate
different questions and then they selected 10 questions per category and collected answers from five chatbots
And then they used GPT4 for evaluation again
So it rated the answer based on healthfulness, relevance, accuracy and detail
This is actually a very interesting use case for GPT4
So basically it can assess the quality of answers as well
So all the students not only you can generate your essays with GPT4 or chat GPT
But in future it's going to also score your essays and assignments
One thing they found was it's not really good at judging math or coding tasks
Which is kind of strange because now they have a core interpreter as well in GPT4
So based on the results in terms of predictive response quality assessed by GPT4
Vecunia can be as good as 92% of chat GPT responses
So it is very close to chat GPT
But let's look at the actual responses to see if whether it's actually close to chat GPT or not
Now they have provided a demo where you can actually access
Vecunia 13b and play around with it
So here I simply ask it can you create a 3D travel plan for LA and it gives me a pretty detailed answer
So before further playing with this let's look at the evaluation responses that were judged by GPT4
So this is a very interesting website
They have provided some questions in these 10 different categories that they mentioned
And then response from Vecunia along with the other models
And the great thing is they have also provided
Evaluation from GPT4
So let's look at a few examples before we actually experiment with the Vecunia model itself
But first let's look at the writing category
And then there are 10 different questions
So for example for this question composed in engaging travel blog post about a recent trip to Hawaii
Highlighting cultural experiences and must-see attraction
So GPT4 gave 9x10 and 9x10 both to Vecunia and chat GPT
So here is the response from chat GPT
But I think we are interested in Vecunia
So I'm going to read I think a paragraph of it and let's see how good the flow is
So Aloha fellow travelers if you're looking for tropical paradise with the rich culture and
breathtaking scenery
Look no further than Hawaii
My recent trip to Aloha state was an unforgettable adventure filled with exciting cultural experiences
And must-see attractions
So of course now our trip to Hawaii could be complete without spending some time at the beach
With this crystal clear waters, golden sand and gentle waves
That actually looks pretty nice, I would say
If you compare it with chat GPT responses, I think it's it's it's up there
All right, I'm going to put a link to this page so you can look at these different examples
Let's look at something else
And let's say
Try to script for a youtube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz
Right, so hello and welcome to a youtube video in the history
All right jazz is a yeah, I think it doesn't look bad at all and in this case GPT4 thinks it's
8x10 and here's the response so assistant one
which is
Chat GPT provided a well-structured script for a youtube video including visual cues
In narration, which made it more engaging and informative rain assistant to Vakunya
Also provided a good response discussing the history and culture significance of jazz influence on the other
Okay, it's rolling in civil rights movements
However, assistant to the responsible is less engaging and back the visual cues and structure
For a video script. Okay, so there they are actually competing three different things
Chat GPT versus Vakunya and then you can even see the ability of GPT in GPT4 to assess these so which is great
Let's say in terms of roleplaying the GPT4 thinks that Vakunya is as good as chat GPT
Which is pretty awesome
Let's see
Coding examples now one thing that we notice about GPT4 is not good at evaluating math and coding
So but so far from what I have seen I can't say that the responses are pretty nice
How do social media platform in this one is the way people consume share?
Okay, so in this case
GPT4 thinks that
Vakunya actually gave a better response
So again, I'm going to put a link to this. You can actually go and experiment with this
I think it's a pretty
nice tool to simply compare the responses and see how good this model is
But let's go and play with it ourselves. Okay, so I'm going to put a link to it
How you can use it?
But here is a question that I asked thread an email explaining why GPT4 should be open source
Now keep in mind it doesn't have access to internet. So it doesn't know what GPT4 is
But here's the response as you may know GPT4 is a groundbreaking language model
That has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact with technology had it its core GPT4 is an open source project
And we believe that its continued development improvement should remain in the hands of the community
I actually doesn't know what GPT4 is
But it's writing a letter about it
I'll also show you a response from chat GP team so that we can compare it
Right, then there are several reasons. So one is collaboration and innovation
Open source project foster cooperation and innovation among a community of developers researchers and enthusiasts
By allowing others to continue contribute to the project site
Then improved quality and open source project can draw
On the collective expertise of a diverse community
Which can lead to more accurate and reliable models. This is particularly important
for a complex and powerful to like GPT4
Then transparency with an open source project
The source core and development process process are transparent
Which allows for greater accountability and trust in technology. It's making actually some really good points
uh flexibility
So open source project can be adopted and modified
To meet specific needs and use cases
Which can lead to more flexible and um customizable solution
I think if it had access to GPT4
The internet and knew its capabilities
The GPT4's capability it could come up with some other arguments as well
Now same question and the response from uh chat GPT
So as you may know the development of AI and machine learning model is a rapid rapid advancing feed
That is the potential to revolutionize industries and societies as whole. So you see like it that
Uh
Texts is pretty similar like it's using similar words and it's because that the training data is derived from
Chat GPT. So one such model j so GPT4 is a set
To be released in your future. Okay, so it kind of have a sense of that. Okay
What is deep into what GPT4 is so deep open open sourcing GPT4
Uh
Would mean that the open source of data used to train the model would be freely available, right? So it's a more uh
A descriptive I would say but let's look at the reasons, right?
So advancements of research, uh, in this case, it's talking about advancement of research, but
Vakunya was talking about um
Collaboration and innovation. So innovation is basically advancement of research, right then, uh increase trust
uh, so we had uh
Improved quality transparency. So it's basically
Looking at the same points and then flexibility
Which I think is accessibility, right? Um, do they could be, uh, relevant. So
From the responses it does seem to be
Um
Similar to to chart GPT if not, uh, right there yet. Okay next, uh, I asked both of them
To create a list of things I need to do, uh, to plan for my wife's birthday party
Okay, so it came up with a list and they look pretty similar. Uh, chart GPT
Set of date. Well, it's a birthday party. So, okay
Uh, decided on a theme guest list venue invitation food and drinks
decoration entertainment gifts timeline
Set up and cleanup, right and here's the list, uh set up budget
Word is marked choose a theme make a guest list choose a venue
right
So decide on a location for the party whether it's at home or or a rented hall or whatever, right plan the menu
Uh plan the decorations. So this is pretty similar list
Send out invitations purchase supplies make a timeline
Uh plan for transportation higher entertainment order flowers, right?
Uh, okay. Good point. All right. Uh, make a shopping list and plan for emergencies. So, uh, and if you look at the more detailed description
It actually does a pretty nice job and I think like
I would say in some cases you won't really, uh, see the difference between the two
Although in the stand it was a little more descriptive and simply said, all right
Here's the list of things you can do, right? So but but I would say like both of them are pretty good
Okay, one thing to note from time to time
You might encounter this network error
This regenerator refresh the space, right? So, uh, I have noticed that happens a lot of people are trying to access it
Uh, so they are simply prioritized
Some folks which kind of make sense now. I asked it to actually write a python program and the great thing is that actually
Formatted it, right? Let's look at it whether it's actually
uh
correct or not
Okay, and wow, this is great because it also explains the code like
Uh chat GPT
So this function takes an integer num as an input and check if it's prime or not, right?
And then it explains the logic as well. So this is pretty awesome. I would say, okay
It's still writing so it's giving examples as well. I'm actually impressed
This this definitely could be as good as chat GPT
Now since it was able to actually solve that coding problem
I'm going to ask it to actually write a code for a website
that has three buttons
And whenever each button should display a random joke when pressed
So let's see
Whether it can actually come up with that or not. It came up with the code just by looking at it seems to be working
I'm going to run it too. One thing I noticed is that
It actually stopped producing the code. So it seems like there is
A limit to it like how much textures can generate but let's run this
In a web browser
And see if we can create a working website
Okay, so when I ran the code it did make a website
However, if I click on this joke one
or any of the joke so it
Dispays this message this sorry the joke doesn't exist
Uh, so let's ask it if it actually can fix the issue or not
Okay, so it gave me the code again
Um, so let's run it again. So here's the website and actually it works. Which is crazy
This is the type of thing that uh
Chat GPT can do
Like I had to do a little bit of tweaking
But it actually works which is impressive. So again, let's get a little philosophical with this
And we will ask it. What is the meaning of life? So one thing you will notice is that um, I'm in a queue
Uh, there are some people ahead of me
And so it could be a little slow in response
But uh, still it's free
It's okay. So here's the response the meaning of life is a philosophical and existential
Question that has been debated and explored by various thinkers scientists and religious leaders throughout history
It's a complex and subjective topic
And different people may have different answers. Okay in general
The meaning of life can be thought of as
The overarching purpose or significance that gives our lives direction and fulfillment
Some people believe that the meaning
Of lies the life is to seek happiness love and fulfillment
while other believe
that
It is to serve a higher power or achieve spiritual enlightenment
There is no correct answer to the question of the meaning of life
And may be something that each individual needs to discover for themselves based on their beliefs and experiences
Cool based on my experience. This is the
On the open source chat bot which comes close to chat gpt
Actually, there are some other parameters as well. So for example
Now right now and we were limiting the output tokens to 512
But you can take it uh to double that size. So I think the one example where I saw that it stopped responding
We could do that. Uh, and then
You can change the creativity and everything using the temperature as well
So overall
It's a very impressive too. It's definitely uh
Much better than uh lama and alpaca and even the gpt for all that. Uh, I I posted another video
So I'll post this link again. Uh, you can explore it now
There's definitely one question that you might be thinking. Can you access it locally? Right before that, um, I want to actually show you one more thing
There is another model called kovala, which, uh, I don't know if it's available or not. We can actually test it
Now let's return it. So it's another model which is going to be released pretty soon
Uh, it's a very similar, uh, supposed to be very similar
in responses
But I'm going to keep you posted for that
Um, okay, it doesn't seem to be what I get
Assemblies that signal is
That the answer was not really um
That long always it makes sense. Okay
Now you might be thinking can you use this on your local machine?
So to answer this let's look at the release plan. So initially there is the training
Serving an evaluation code on github repo, right? We plan to release the model weights by providing a version of delta weights
uh
That build on the original
Lama weights, but we are still figuring this out, right? So if they haven't
Release the weights, they might release it
Uh
Well, I think I'll I'll look at the discord server to see
When that happens, I'll definitely make a video on it. Now in order to train it the training is going to be very tricky because
um
It needs around eight
um
A 100 gpus to train it. So it's amazing to see how uh far we have come
Just in a span of two or three weeks
Since uh, I'll pack I was released. Um, it's simply
Astonishing to look at the progress
Uh, thanks for watching. Hope you like the video
Uh, if you did, please like consider liking the video and subscribing to the channel
Thanks for watching. See you in the next one
