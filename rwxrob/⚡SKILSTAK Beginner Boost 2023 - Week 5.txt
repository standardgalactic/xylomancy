Welcome to week five of the beginner booths. This week we are going to be
focused on making changes to files and we've already been kind of focused on
moving files around and searching for them and stuff like that. We actually
haven't there's a couple of commands that we have left over to do with regard
to you know moving files around. We have not done the MV command which I want to
add right here really quick. So how do I move or rename a file or directory and
let's see how do I move multiple files and remove what's multiple files. So one
of the reasons that I avoided these commands last time was that hey hello
was that they just require a discussion of something called globbing which is a
way to specify more than one file at a time. Okay and that's not something that
we did in the other you know weeks because we were all about dealing with one
file at a time and you know we want to keep it really succinct. So there's two
main things that we're going to do today. We're going to wrap up the moving
around of files and all of those commands and directories and then we're
going to start we're going to touch on the absolute minimum. We did a prep
session last week I don't know if you know this but every week we do a prep
session to try to focus in on the absolute minimum necessary to get you
boosted which I'll just as a reminder is to fulfill something like a machine
learning engineering job where all you care about is using Linux you don't care
about becoming a you know a great system administrator you can certainly a
essential step to that but there's a lot of stuff in the internet and online
that in certifications that that go too far they they require you to know things
that only a system administrator for Linux or Unix would need to know and
really you just want to be good on the command line that means you've already
got Linux someone's already set it up for you right so the assumption
generally speaking on the internet a general when they talk about Linux is
that you want to become a system administrator really you just want to
use it so I just want to restate that that's the reason that we kind of skipped
week three we went with week four last week and it's the reason that as we go
forward every single decision about what we cover and when is scrutinized with
that one priority in mind what is the minimum I need to do to be able to be
productive using Linux right not not you know and I'm talking about the Unix
command line stuff like that all right so let's keep going so that's that's
where this statement comes from I just once again the ones over to the left
people always ask that's because it's in markdown that'll be rendered as one two
three four we covered that on the first day so what is the minimum I need to
understand about users groups permissions of reproductive how do I
search within a file inside of a file like if I want to search from the
command line I want to go inside a file and find stuff in there these all have
commands to go with them if you know the command awesome I'm deliberately doing
it though like this so that you can quiz yourself right so as you're going
through you can ask also this will help it pop up more quickly in search results
whether it be through the skill sack that I oh just a reminder for those of you
don't remember you can go to skill sack dot I oh and you can see the all of the
stuff for the beginner boost is here the overview the quick start and such are
all here we're on week five which is not posted yet but here in week four you
can see how we did that right so we have we have this right here and if you want
to quiz yourself you can just kind of cover over these answers and then just
look at this there is a way for us to cover that so you have to click on it
to see it but we've decided to not do that so so that it prints well so if you
want to quiz yourself the reason that we did it this way is so that if you want
to test yourself and kind of a multiple choice way you can go in and do it you
can answer those questions okay so so that's why we do it that way how do I
search within a file from the command line it's also by the way the same recipe
of as as the recipe books you're Riley very famous you know recipe style books
which are like each section is like a specific task and how to do it and that
submit a very popularized model starting I believe with for Riley back in the
90s as a publisher how do I filter out and only certain lines of a file how do
I edit a file with the official editor for Unix that's right the official
editor for Unix and Linux we're going to talk about which editor that is it's not
what you think probably and how do I change a file in place from the command
line it's called in place editing and at the very end we're going to talk about
regular expressions and that is plenty to fill two hours okay we are going to
take our break but you won't notice it because we're going to take a pause in
the middle but so in case you're wondering I'll just spoiler alert here we
are not going to cover all of the editing stuff in today so some of that's
going to spill over to next week and there's one specific very popular
editor that's not going to be covered today it's not the editor you think but
but we are going to cover the official Unix editor a few people in the chat
actually know what I'm talking about and I'm going to get I always get laughed
at when I cover this because nobody on the internet covers it in fact I would
challenge you to find a single YouTube video besides mine that actually covers
the official Unix editor and it's not what you think yeah so everybody's making
fun guesses okay we'll get to it so let's let's let's kind of keep this up
here and and so okay so just a reminder if you don't have your your boost
container up you should have it up if you are just joining us for the first
time go do the quick start right there's a quick start video it's 40 minutes it's
the first video on my entire site and if you go there and watch the quick start
that will get you going then then in order to get started you only have to do
one thing okay so after you get the quick start video you pull up your terminal
sure you know how to do that okay and then what also covered in the quick start
we do this we do podman start dash a y dash a to attach and then boost we named
it boost you can name it whatever and that's gonna boom that's where we're
logged in we're logged in as a user on the skill stack container image image
the container it's a container from the skill stack and all that's covered in
the quick start so that's what that's the first thing you need right and we'll
use the commands we did from last week list all the files let's dash a again
this is all covered here how to change directories how to look at files we
covered piping and redirection we covered all this is super important that
you understand standard Aaron standard out make sure you don't skip that you
need to understand the different streams of data and how that they are modeled by
a device something okay so that I'm assuming you know all that here we go so
now it's time to start doing stuff now as you can see I've already got a bunch
of files here and we are gonna go through all these files just not today so
we're gonna go into what they are but we need to learn how to look into files
and move stuff around and then how to minimally edit files before we start
doing all that customization alright so so let's and we're gonna keep this
project-based today so we're gonna have some goals like for example the primary
goal today is gonna be I want to start writing scripts I want to start doing
things on my terminal right so there's a few things you need to be able to do to
be able to do that right so and and one of the commands that we did not have and
I actually just realized I need to add let's see okay so how do I create a new
directory okay so we already did how do I remove a directory so let's let's make
sure I didn't cover this I know I know it's rough and but so so we had created
new file but we don't have had a created directory so let's do that one right
away and if you don't like how rough and this is I'm sorry that's just how it is
alright so let's make a directory so let's say I want to make a place to put
my scripts okay so there's nothing here we don't necessarily want it hidden we
haven't covered hidden files but let's actually talk about that so how do I hide
a file or directory you know I don't like that it calls it hide but it is
depending on operating system it does hide it so the answer to that is pretty
simple you put a dot in front of it right do we want our scripts directory to be
hidden no so let's go ahead and make a directory for our scripts now we're
gonna move this thing later after we learn about getting GitHub but not right
now so make directory mkdir that's the name okay and then we're going to do mkdir
and then we're going to put the name we'll just call it scripts okay and now
we have we do our LS we have that now if I did LS-AL or LL which is a oops sorry
AL you'll see that we have all these other stuff but now we see the scripts
right now we haven't gone through what all of this stuff means yet and that's
we're gonna today we're gonna go through what why is it user and we're gonna go
through that today but but don't worry so just I'll ask by itself it shows you
only this stuff that you have that are visible and and then you you have the
scripts directory in there okay we already know how to change into that
directory right so CD scripts all right so now we are inside of this directory
how do we know because when I cd to put it there right and when I want to see
where I am my pwd and it shows me where I am plus my prompt is also telling me
that I'm in the scripts directory here you can yeah you can use sheet sometimes
it doesn't have everything but so so that's how we're gonna go in the
directory so let's actually put this here so how do I create a new directory and
we're gonna write it out I'm using you guys this is a good markdown review you
should be taking notes do you guys have your notes open you should have your
notes open and be keeping your own notes right we went through notes on the
first day so open up your your github in another window and get ready to start
taking notes you should be practicing your markdown so you're writing your own
textbook your own black book as they used to call it you know we're gonna do
your thing so I'm gonna put shell here and then let's put so what is the command
I just did did I do four by the way I have to do four one two three four if you
don't do four it won't it won't indent it so and you know won't do it properly so
we're gonna put here we're gonna put how do I create a new directory we're gonna
put make der right and we'll say name and when it's all caps so this is a
convention I'm doing the same convention that you see in man pages so man if I do
man and make docs right I know what am I saying there you go so see this this
is a I'm using the same conventions for my documentation that you'll find a man
pages so in man and this this varies across the board people will sometimes do
you know I put angle brackets and all that kind of jazz no just use the same
thing that that man pages use manual pages so this is this is anytime you
have something that isn't isn't you know a variable it can be changed a director
ease right see directory they use they use all caps to refer to it okay so that
I'm gonna follow that convention in my documentation and I strongly recommend
that you follow the same okay as you can see the make der has the command has
lots of different arguments and you can try those I encourage you to do that
where again the boost is designed to get you you know so you know what you need
to know and then show you where to go find it so so and to some degree to do
it with you so there you go that's the make doc make your command and you know
we need to change into that directory as so you know and how do we do that you
already know it how to edit markdown notes from your phone you don't that I
know of you'd have to you could open it with the web browser but that would be a
bad idea yeah the editing notes from your phone is hard yeah I'm sorry there's
no right now we haven't covered anything with regard to that so but if you want to
try it before it so yeah I mean if you're gonna use third party applications
take note look taking notes is your deal but I'm just telling you if you don't
take notes in GitHub you will lose them and you will be sad the whole point of
you have a backup right and and you should definitely be using markdown to
take your notes so but if you if you insist on taking notes from your phone
which I think is I mean the whole point of this is using a terminal which means
you essentially have you know a machine at your disposal while you're doing this
then I suggest against taking notes with the phone but if that's what you want to
do fine all right so we got a scripts directory how do we get into there we
already did it we did we did the CD scripts here right how do I learn
information about CD man CD oh there's no man in page information a little bit
of a review why don't I get any information for CD how what's the other
ways to get help this is in week one right so we can do help CD and then we
can get the we can get the information oh no it went off the screen how do I see
all of it we covered that already pipe to less or more right so there we go
change the show is working directory okay good good good right the reason for
what's the difference between help and man covered that already I'm just giving
you re review questions all right so how do I how do I hide a file one two three
four say and these guys I might can't I might make these into flashcards so let's
see give it a period a dot as the first character in name yeah all right so how
do I rename a file or directory let's do that okay we're gonna go faster because
we're gonna spend the time on it so if we wanted to create let's let's see here
let's let's say we we did this what I do with the two dots are by the way went
up a level right what if I don't like that name what if I want to use a capital
I don't and you probably shouldn't but what if I did okay it's the MV command so
the MV command takes whatever its target is and then I don't know did you see that
I push SC tab yeah get used to doing that it's called tab completion you should
do that all right I'm gonna put thing here how do I avoid typing long name long
or complicated names especially ones that have white space in them right tap tab for
once or twice for tab completion all right this is built by defaults in most
shells including the one we're using today if it does not work it means it
hasn't been enabled or hasn't been installed that's not a topic for the
boost but that is if you want to know how to activate it that would be home
lab in it or one of our other boosts that we're gonna have okay so that's how
you do it let's try it I'm just gonna add it keep adding them as we as we
encounter them this one however needs to go away that one needs to go away there
we go all right so let me put let me put this what is this week five I'm just
renaming my notes so I know which one we're on all right so I go back here so
we want to move it now I put a slash after that that's okay that's just to
show it's a directory slashes will be ignored if you know if they're not
relevant so it's okay that it put the slash we put a space and I want to make
it capital scripts don't need a slash I could but I don't need it and now you
see that it's been renamed to scripts so practice that practice making a
directory and renaming it a couple times right now let's actually hide it
all right how do I do that scripts to dot dot secret scripts all right how about
that oh no where did it go all right there it is it's there dot secret
scripts right so we want to be able to see it so dot secret scripts is going to
be now it's going to be I turn it back to scripts and we've got it we can CD into
scripts and push tab again so I push tap for everything because let me let me
show you something where we're okay so let's talk about complicated names right
especially on Windows and this is another reason that we use git bash in
fact I am going to use git bash as an example of why you want to learn tap
completion in bash so I'm about to open up a new window this is a git bash
window on Windows you can do it with brew you can do a terminal on on Mac
whatever the reason I'm going to use this is because this is a much more
likely place for you to find a need for naming so as as you know this is my
personal streaming PC and the stuff that you're looking at right now are the the
files that are on my machine and if you can you immediately can see that they
are Windows like files right they don't look like you know a happy pretty you
know stuff from from from bash or from Linux and they have you can see the
extensions at exe's because of Windows and then you see weird stuff like this
like virtual box you know VMs let's do that again LS pipe to more oh wait
there's no LS and there's no more because this is Windows let's try less
alright so there we go this is okay so here are some folders that are in my
desktop that I just made out of for no reason at all using the graphic you know
the desktop user interfaces yeah they have spaces in them annoying right well
check this out watch what happens when I try so I can do LS let's do LS new tab
tab I did two tabs do you see that I'm gonna do that again again I'm on Windows
here right occasionally you'll find files that have spaces or weird characters
in them any character is a valid character except for null inside of a
file name and you can actually use that to great effect and this is a little bit
of a spoiler if you're gonna do over-the-wire bandit for hackers because
they do have files that are named in there that you have a very hard time
accessing and stuff because they've been named really weird you can actually name
files control that have control characters in them and sometimes you'll do
it on accident so so knowing this is super important so if you if you do LS
you'll see all the files there now if I if I just wanted to list okay I'm gonna
show you your first glob thing right I want to list all the files that begin
with new so I list new star okay now we're we're gonna come back to globbing
in general just this bit but this is gonna list all the files with the with
new star and as you can see we have the the LS output is a little bit weird
because it's Windows but we can see we have new dist.vmk we have new space
folder and the new line in them is fine yes and writing shell scripts that deal
with this is super interesting because this extra space that's here if you
don't properly put quotes around it it can really ruin your day it can actually
make you write really insecure code code that would really break something and I
have a couple stories about that that I won't share right now about very big
projects that release production code that did not account for spaces that in
one case everybody that ran the program it had to run as root and it destroyed
and a slash of R or some like really important directory file system so you
understanding this naming convention is these naming stuff is super important
please don't you know deal please don't ignore this I mean I know it's not
really official I don't know if we should put a thing how do I avoid typing
long complicated names as the how do I about safely okay and what I'm gonna put
safely in there because because seriously when we start scripting you
will see all the possibilities of really killing things there's a system D yeah
you know what one I was talking about great hat great had a good guess so so
anyway so new folder you see but once I want you to see right away is that you
see that this on Windows instead of it putting a slash after there for some
reason it decided to put this this colon which means it's a folder and if you
look on my my system you'll see that is named new folder and you'll see the
that this is wrapped in single quotes which are safer than double quotes for
reasons we'll get into later they they don't they don't allow variable
expansion is the short answer so so but how do I how do I delete that guy right
what if I what if I just want to delete the second one right so the way to the
safest way is where batch completion comes in as you can say so well first of
all let's just list them all so let's say I want to list new tab tab two tabs and
then it actually lists three different directories we see in bash style it shows
this one directory it's really hard to tell where the directory ends and begins
though isn't it because they're all got spaces in them more of a story don't put
spaces in your names I mean if you can help it it's a really bad idea and god
can you imagine if I had deleted everything that began with new I would be
deleting I'd be blowing away a virtual machine image that I have here which
would kill that virtual machine completely so knowing how to isolate this is
very important now so the first way to do this is to type a backslash if you type
a backslash and then a space and then a tab it'll it'll get to the next thing
okay so spaces and pretty much anything can be backslash escaped from the
command line and you can just keep going about your way you notice that that
parentheses is also a special character so it is put a backslash in front now
the tab if you don't want to remember all of this though just remember to tab
complete so I do tab twice and I say okay what's the next option well the next
option is either two or three so if you type it's if I type a two and then I
type a tab it now has enough to complete the entire name and if I just keep
typing tab and won't do anything because that's the last one okay that is the
magic of tab completion now that is a pain in the butt to type if I had had to
type that and sometimes the names are even longer really I mean sometimes you
have names that have got you you IDs in them or whatever right and you do not
want to type that so you want to learn that about tab completion so in this
case that's new tab tab and then I like oh okay well we want the most space in
it tab tab and by the way you can't just type space here because that could be
anything right so it has to be slash space tab tab and it's like oh I want
tab tab I want to tab tab right and so then it just lists the one right and I
I'm curious to see but I'm kind of giving you the answer this is how you
remove a directory and somebody's gonna tell you to not to use another command
we're not even gonna tell you the other command if you're in twitch and you know
the other command and you type it please don't right people love to troll you
about what command to end room and then then then you go do it and you destroy
your whole computer this is the command the proper command for removing a
directory and we're gonna get to it in a bit but but so now what oh wow well
what happened did it remove it I can't tell because it's kind of quietly I don't
know we're gonna have to go check how do I check so LS new tab tab oh look now we
just have three and this so obviously is gone and there's no undo there's no
going into the trash and getting rid of it the recent I didn't show you removing
and destructive commands yet because I wanted to make sure you understand that
in Linux with great power comes great responsibility and not only can you
remove a single file like that and never have any hope of getting it back again
short of like going to the subsystem on disk and restoring from you know bits in
the file system which you can do if it as if you're working for you know some
sort of forensic security firm or something I mean you could do that but
but for the most part it's gone I mean that it's not zeroed out and it's a
hacker I feel the obligation to tell you that that the the the stuff that existed
inside of that file or directory is still there it's just been it just been
removed from the file system table so that's disk space will be overwritten
again but I can actually go in there had passwords in there I can go in there and
find it right so if you've so furthest for the sake of the hackers out there just
know that removing a thing is not enough you have to zero it out you have to do
even way more than that but for the sake of a Linux user you understand that
that's enough okay ZFS rollback I don't know if I would be okay with that unless
it's an yeah if it says SD then it might be gone yeah there there are ways to get
to it all the hackers are having fun talking about all the ways to get to
data that's been deleted deleted right debate you know most people in a class
like this are not going to tell you that it still exists right but I am because
there are definitely ways to get that stuff back I have done it many many
times so anyway so let's go back here so tab completion to to get it how do you
rename a file directory we already did that one two three four so it's up to you
to practice it now so move old to the new right and that goes for files that
goes for files and for and and for directories okay now there is a caveat
here in fact I'm gonna put a thing here I'm gonna put a thing here yeah I'm
gonna put an ammunition I'm gonna say warning so I am I'm gonna put a warrant
ammunition for a warning uh-huh this is not marked on this is mark make docs be
very careful I'm gonna call this danger actually date when moving and renaming
since you can easily clobber an existing file or directory instead of renaming now
this is the time this is the part where some wise guy or wise person is gonna
say you know you really should teach him how to turn no clobber on and I don't
want to teach you to become dependent on no clobber because it's not on on most
systems there there is a setting in bash where you can turn no clobber on and in
the past I've turned it on the default and then you have to do an extra command
in order to to clobber existing files it's the default in many systems but not
always and I would rather you learn in the right way you become like a really
paranoid person as opposed to just trusting no clobber protect you okay so
that's that's the answer if you want to know why and and let me show you what I
mean by that okay so if I if I if I made a new scripts directory right so let's
let's take a real situation let's direct let's remove our directory all right
and so there's nothing here and let's pretend like we had started to create you
know I'm using commands that we already know echo date to the end of my scripts
file okay so let's say that scripts is a file that's gonna be just all the
commands that I that I I need to learn or want to make right maybe you saw my
sunrise watch your eyes maybe you saw sunrise and you want to write your own
maybe you saw fishes oh come on baby there we go maybe you saw fishes and you
want to write your own okay so so let's do that echo fishes and we're making a
list using the commands that we know right now why am I using two angle
brackets instead of one because I want to see what's here right oops why is it
not tabbing can't have okay so cat scripts there we go and we see fishes
date and all that okay so let's so so just a very real scenario you you have
got you know you can do clear or C is a shortcut and you can see we have the
scripts file here right so let's say I didn't check and I come in here and I'm
like mmm I can't wait let's start writing those scripts that I had and you
forget that you had a list called scripts now make directory is going to
probably protect us so yep there we go okay so we're lucky with make directory
we got protected right but but let's say let's say let's like say that we
already had something else so let's say make their scripts okay so they came in
we made it scripts and we didn't do an LS so we don't know I'm gonna do an
anyway but let's let's say let's pretend like we didn't know we had the
scripts list right and I say oh I don't want the uppercase but you don't remember
why we made it uppercase in the first place I mean be very this is very
contrived but anyway so we want to rename it watch this oh can't do it okay
that's because if they're both once the directory ones a file but now let's do
this let's make another list let's say touch let's get rid of the directory
first our under scripts alright so let's say we had let's say we made another
list or something how about we say this we say touch our reacts scripts right now
watch I say I want to move our be our to be X scripts to scripts okay and it did
it and it did not complain that I that is the reason I'm showing you that of
all of the mistakes that I have made in Linux and Unix over the years the the
times when I have blown something away that was substantial particularly while
I was coding in an application with multiple libraries and multiple
individual files or test cases or something like that of all of the
things that I have done to blow away code that has not you've been committed
that is the number one thing that is the number one mistake I make and because
it's very innocuous it's I mean is that the right word it just it just sneaks up
on you right now you can set no clover to stop that kind of thing from happening
and if you want to do that that's fine but I it's so annoying because most of
the more usually I mean I I do file renaming all the time because I want to
make a new version of it and I want to copy over and things like that so it's
so annoying to have to deal with no clover turned on that I turn it off and I
risk it at you know but the safe the way to protect yourself from that of
course is to use get and to do get commits as you go and we're not there
yet we're gonna get there but I want you to just see the danger of this okay so
if I cat scripts now and city is there and city is there you go yeah innocuous
means not dangerous yeah what does innocuous mean we're gonna learn how to
search like this from the command line producing no injury ah that's the wrong
word I meant insidious yeah it's insidious because it sneaks up on you
yeah so what does I mean I know what this means yes yeah I'm just showing what I
don't know her adjective intended for a trap or beguile the yes insidious it
very insidious we're gonna learn how to search for the command line although
there it is now you know how to do it you just type a question mark and type it
in you might want to give it a try if it's kind of fun you won't know what to do
when you get there you haven't navigated but we are gonna get there
promise all right so let's go back I think we covered that like probably too
much right so be very careful learning since you can easily clobber an existing
power directory don't bother with activating no clobber because it will
get in your way more than help you just become aware slash paranoid about the
danger okay and this this can be really this I almost want to show you but
there you can do this kind of thing and blow away your entire file system so
that that is not unheard of to do that right so so just be aware I'm gonna leave
that is as a single I think and I never know whether to do that or not I guess
I'm gonna go ahead and leave it as a thing all right so so we know how to move
old stuff to make it new and we're almost out of time on this first hour so
let's talk about the next stuff here so we know how to make directories and how
to hide files we know how to rename stuff using move now we haven't got into
globbin yet how do I safely avoid typing long and complicated names we did that
how do I move multiple files all right so this is the beginning of globbin and
I'm actually gonna take a break really quick and I'll come back and we'll do
globbin you can you envy dash I for interactive that's a good way that's a
good tip yeah but that consider MV dash I as well I'll put that little pin there
thank you for mostly I I do not like interactive and I would never put an
alias for that because that would screw up your scripts so yeah yeah so I am
sorry I'm gonna take a break really quick here so I can go sneeze and stuff
I'll be right back okay back to regular schedule programming we were done with
the talk about killing each other with their clickety-clack mechanical versus
you know silent keyboards we have a lot of fun over here we do we just went
through this huge debate about about ergo keyboards versus clickety-clack
keyboards versus laptops that can go anywhere and I'm just gonna rest my case
here if you become master if you become a master of ergo keyboard you can't use
the computer without the ergo keyboard not not the same a fashion you probably
might be able to so forget about taking a laptop to oh I don't know any business
meeting or try you know travel job or the coffee shop or anything like that so I
am really really anti specific keyboard I am really I'm also Gen X which meant
we grew up in a time when keyboards are you know you have to go to the computer
and use that keyboard you have to share your computer with the rest of the
family and if you force them into a Dvorak keyboard or an ergo keyboard you
know the whole family's gonna come after you so that's my generation this the
younger generations are all about about you know flexibility and and and
personal I don't know you know like representing themselves and their
personality and their keyboards and am I still one fundamental flaw if you do
that you have to take it with you that means you can't work and on it unless
you're at it which makes you into a shut-in it's a joke it's a joke but at
least three people said yeah I feel called out now so I would rather have a
laptop and then I am another laptop is not optimal but you know what I can use
it anywhere I can code anywhere I can go from the plane I can go from the
airport I can code from anywhere right I can go from the boring party which I've
done I've actually taken my laptop regularly I do this all the time talk
about white noise I would take my laptop to like a really good band and a bar and
there'd be like 50 people on a Friday night and I would be sitting there
coding away something my latest creation or whatever with like a really nice IPA
right there and I and I would just love the white noise everybody's looking me
like I was crazy and I was like loving it I was like in the party and I'm I'm
over in the corner you know on the nice comfy couch vintage you know air a
couch and it's really great you know the bar and I'm coding away and if I had a
Ergo keyboard I could not do that all right also sound engineering can't do
that you can't do that in which I've done right you can't go to you can't anyway
so so so not a not a not a fan of that oh thank you for the raid head so we were
just fighting about keepers I'll let you guys fight about keepers later we we
before we were so really interrupted by me making the break we were working
on I don't let me remind myself what we were working on we were like renaming
things we were talking about the multiple file stuff and we were gonna get
we were getting going on gloving okay so let's do something fun here actually do
this if you if you have the skill stack boost image you can do this right now
what is gloving all right hit enter I'm gonna kind of show you how to use this
now we're so to go down to the to the next you can push space and it will it
will page down okay so the first the first hit is in computer programming
glob pattern specify sets of file names and wild card characters for example in
you special which is what we're talking about the command MV dot txt files moves
all files with the names ending in dot txt this is this is this is taking a space
out there's supposed to be a space in there that looks like there was a
glob in it yet back let's go read that okay so to read it I'm pushing J to go
down and K to go up okay we're gonna these navigations gonna come back in
later you're gonna be like what okay so now to follow the link we're gonna push
L which is right so now we can space we can space I'm doing all this is one hand
the other hand I wouldn't got coffee as a you know so who needs social all right
so we're gonna push space and we're gonna go down to it and I in computer
programming glob pattern specify okay look at all these fancy things so now we
can read it right specify sets of files with wild card characters for example the
command MV star otherwise called splat or asterisk I guess if you want dot txt to
text files moves MV well there you go that's a spoiler alert this is how you
move multiple files right so you use a use a wild card glob and that will move
all the files that ended txt in the names of that txt I have a quick story
about this I was teaching I was teaching a mother a home you know a a woman who
had raised you know a family for the most part and she want to learn how to
code and she was getting a lot of crap from the men in her life about not being
technical and not being it was kind of the sad story actually and she was
amazing and she was like no I'm gonna learn this stuff and I showed her she
had no point of reference when it came to directories and file systems may have
spent mentioned her before and when I showed her how to take all of these
files and move them all with a single command she insisted that I derail the
entire stuff that I was going to teach her and teacher everything about the
command line from that point on because it was so powerful and sure enough as
soon as you show somebody that you can do all of these things from the command
line somebody called it magic even tab completion you show tab completion to
people who don't know about it and they think it's wizardry right and you just now
you know you know the basic wizardry stuff and moving like the what consider
what it would take to do that let's let's actually do this example okay so
this by the way let's just end on the thing a glob is a thing so this moves
anything let's just do it really quick since we have so this means anything and
this means exactly one of anything all right and that's really all you need to
know for now now there's a lot of wild card matching you can do but those are
only the only two main ones you need to know about right and those actually go
they do work on different things so so let's say let's remove our scripts
directory oh you don't know about this one yet let me see this let me let me go
through and show you this one too how do we do we say remove a file okay so how
do I remove how do I remove files all right how do I move multiple files and
how do I remove files so let's let's go ahead and move it for now and put it out
of the way yeah w3m is good too but link still kicks his ass it does I'll make
it I'll make that case all day I have it's there's videos on it if you want to
go watch him we're gonna cover that in very extensive form hi I'm gonna so so
let's move this so I want to move scripts let's make a few files here so
first of all we don't care so I'm gonna teach you how to remove a single file so
to remove a single file one two area oh I can't see because my cameras are all
right so let's do rm file okay and you can or you could do rm you know you
could actually do file and then dot dot dot now the dot dot that when you see
dot dot dot you know you could put file order actually you can't do there but I'm
not gonna teach you rm dash r after oops I already did I don't want to teach it
to you yet because it's super dangerous and you shouldn't do it all right how do
I remove files rm file I know I'm all over but we're gonna do it okay so rm
scripts tab okay there was no interactive right let's let's let's somebody
mentioned interactive and if you want to use this fine I never do but if you do
you do dash I scripts it's like removing empty scripts yes okay so if you want to
do that that's fine I think it's a waste of time so I don't do that I just make
sure to be careful and so so here we go I can do things with links that you can't
even dream of doing I imagine because you've never seen it before I'm not
trying to be an asshole I'm just telling you the truth I can find stuff in
milliseconds we're gonna get to that we're gonna get to how to research from
the command line on the internet people see it all the time now how the hell are
you doing that that fast we're gonna cover that not today how do I do a
multiple files globbin okay let's see I tell it let's do this let's say let's do
this how do I remove files how do I move multiple files okay so how do I remove a
file how about that how do I move a file rm file there I don't want to teach you
more than that right now I don't if you want to learn more fine how do you do
it if you want to learn more about the arm command how do you do it you already
know tell me how do you look up more about rm say mr. Rob's like denying us
our learning no I'm not you just I'm just making you go learn on your own so
that when you screw it up you give no one to blame but yourself don't do the
rm-rm slash don't do that you just confirm that you're an idiot by putting
that in a beginner chat we have new people in twitch who love to think
they're clever by telling you that I'm gonna look I am just gonna tell you
because some idiot troll who thinks they're funny is gonna show you this
command right here and I'm actually gonna do it and I'm gonna tell you why
they're idiots for being for trying to show you like this because they don't
even know that it doesn't work because they've never done it they're just
repeating something that somebody else has said all right so let me let me show
you what I'm talking about okay I'm sorry but I have to go through I have to do
this all right so here I have to do this every time because we always have an
idiot who wants to be cute with the beginners and show them how to kick
kill themselves because they think it's funny and they don't have it if somebody
done it to them they would have cried it's like that scene from from from
Guardians of the Galaxy 3 what he's laughing at them after throwing the rock
ha ha ha and he throws it back to him and it's not funny anymore yeah it's not
funny when it happens to you okay so so let's do this pod man we just want a
temporary one a little bit of a little bit of stuff here of pod man are it right
we just want a temporary one so we're gonna remove it and we're gonna make a
ghcr.io slash rfx rob slash ws skillset so we're making a brand new one it's not
even gonna have a name oops run so I'm just making a super temporary one and
that's why I left this crazy name here because it's gonna go away right we
learned through pain and this is if you want to have pain okay so this if you
truly want to test commands that you have are afraid are gonna ruin the
universe or break things do this do pod man run it rm in fact I'm gonna put this
in here I'm gonna put this in here right now I'm gonna put this in here right now
yes how do I create a temporary container just to try dangerous dangerous
stupid things all right oops all right so we're gonna do it I cannot see I
really can't right there I can't I know you think well why do you have to see
you type look I don't edit my videos to make me look good like other streamers
do I just put up the crap where you get to see it all all hang out pond man dash
it that man sense for interactive TTY or remove and you don't need a name or
anything right because you're gonna throw it away so you don't care and then you
just we've got to run run it right ghcpr.io slash rbx Rob slash WS skill
stop okay now you'll already have the image on your machine so how do I
create a temporary just to try dangerous stupid things and that that you can try
it and then when you exit that how do I create a temporary container sandbox
will say to try dangerous stupid things how about that does that sound good uh-huh
okay so so you know it's worth putting it in there this is why we do this live
like this because people have good in good good insights so so here we go we
got we got one now that's not it right that is definitely not it now that's
it why is that it because it's got this crazy number here all right now let's
okay so take very take very long hard look at what host Iran I am not gonna
tell you the story about how I took down the corporate mail server by not
looking at what machine I was on I actually did that in my first three
months as a system administrator I thought I was sure I thought I was so
cool because I'd Linux on the laptop on my desktop right another stupid thing
don't do that I mean I did but you don't need it I had Linux on my laptop I
thought it was super cool I thought I was going home for the day and so we
guess what I typed shut down dash H now I thought I was turning my laptop off for
the day guess what I really turned off right now on containers you'd be safe
from it right now you can do I think you can do reboot if I remember you don't
know these commands yet permission denied by the way this is yet another
reason that we are using a container that has a default you know user so that
you have that kind of net it's kind of a safety net right and I haven't showed you
how to get root access to your own container yet because I want you to
learn how to do it safely before you start blowing things away okay so let me
show you why that person who told you to do RM-RF which is look it up okay
let's let's read this command first of all most of the people that tell you to
do this can't even tell you what it actually means to do it so the dash F
says to force it that means if there was a dash I it overwrites it right or if
there was a no-clob or also overwrites it and then they say recursive so that
means don't only delete this directory but leave everything under it right and
the reason for that is this okay and I didn't want to teach you this but I guess
I'm teaching you it anyway I'm gonna do it how do I remove multiple files how do
I remove a directory and everything under it recursively okay one two three four
all right so this is what they're trying to have you do right RF directory there
all right and so this is what these people try to have you do all right
here we go wait where is it make sure you're on the right thing so let's
actually try this on this on this this machine let's try let's do something
like really stupid all right for so first of all let's try the command that
everybody tries to tell you and I'm gonna tell you why it's so stupid that
they tell you to do it that's the command everybody says to do oh no can't do
it this is what this is what the the troll the idiot trolls who try to trick
beginners don't know because they've never actually tried it they're just
trying to be cool so just know that you're gonna be cooler than them because
you're gonna tell them why it doesn't work okay so RM dash RF without preserve
root doesn't work and hasn't worked for probably more than 10 years so even if
you did do this is root which you're not supposed to know how to do yet but let's
say you did do it is rude so do SU dash now I have root what's the password I'm
not telling you I'm not telling you your own password it's pretty easy to guess
if you hack into your own container during the boost and you destroy everything
that you're on you it's not you you're gonna have to make a new one and start
over but that's good it's good practice right so don't be afraid of it that's
what you want to do fine so now now I have root so now I have read now I can do
this crazy-ass command that all the big all the trolls try to tell you to do oh
no can't do it so so yeah you just you know gave a big old bird to the troll
who tried to tell you to do that because now you can say well you obviously have
the command wrong and if you want to be pedantic and fire back at them which you
probably shouldn't do just walk away and knowing that they have no fucking idea
what they're doing so then you could do this you can say no preserve root I
mean preserve let's just see what happens by the way you all want to see this I
know you do even though it's taking extra time slash all right so if someone's
gonna tell you this command if you're gonna try to troll somebody then you
need to make sure they put dash dash no preservative in there won't work let's
run like an ancient AIX system or something right so now watch and they
have to have root access uh-oh why is it doing stuff and not coming back what's
happening mr. Rob mr. Rob what's happening uh-oh it's not coming back why
want it to stop I'll tell you why because it's in the middle of deleting every
single file on your entire computer and now it's finally it's like oh no you've
always wanted to see what that command does right it's all gone now strangely I
still have a command prompt I just can't do anything now because none of it
exists it's not there anymore so so everybody wants to know what would
actually happen if you do there you go now you just tested it why because you're
using containers look at I'm in this nice happy safe container doing stuff as
root which you should never do and now I know I can test stuff as root and I
guess what it doesn't matter that I don't have any I can't even list files
by the way does anybody know what you can do here there's like a number of
things you can't do you know see I don't even think it's so so there's actually
it's kind of fun actually if you want to do this delete everything in your
container and still try to get around the only thing you can use are bash
shell built-ins and if you exit this shell you're done because the bash
command no longer exists so you still have one running shell the moral of the
story here is even if you deleted your entire operating system that one running
process that you have still works and believe me if you make a mistake like
this you are guarding that process with your life because it is the only way for
you to restore the system if you delete that process and it goes out of memory
which we're going to do processes next tomorrow or next week or the week after
that you're done and this is another reason to really keep a sacred connection
open using something like tmux or something so so I mean it's not there
right I don't even have the ps command so you don't know about this yet but if
you go into slash proc I can't even list the stuff that's here damn what can I do
what can I do how could I do this anyway I have to have a ton of miles inside
echo is something from bash to keep backups yes people make mistakes so so
but we don't have any commands here we don't even have the LS command I'm
trying to think of a thing I could do this a built-in that would work I'm
getting distracted I'm getting distracted anybody know we should we
should have we should we should do a thing we should do a thing with this the
hostname command isn't found oh because so I can't do my prompt yeah in yeah this
is this is a challenge I know I'm distracting so this is fun we'll see if
what would you do if you actually delete okay okay fine let's go back so that was
a fun tangent that was a fun tangent put it somebody put a chapter in the video
about that tangent ps equals yeah but that's just for the hostname thing we
still need to figure out I but there's a ton of hackers that are like how the
hell do I do this now this is the first thing you need to know okay so exit now
notice how we're still on that machine why right we don't know about this yet
but you are on you're a user and this is kind of relevant because we are gonna
be talking about users and groups okay we are gonna do that before we leave
today and I know we're running out of time we only have about a half an hour
left so let's do this so yeah I don't I don't I don't guys got a lot of great
ideas I'm gonna try to stay focused so remember this is a temporary container
we made just for the purposes of testing out these crazy commands right so I'm
gonna type exit and boom I'm back on my art brah bet TV which is what I type
ls to see I'm on my windows machine by the way don't do that command on this
machine why if you happen to do that command on this machine it will happily
destroy your windows machine you have to reinstall from scratch so that's why
they want you to do it so absolutely make sure you know what system you're on
and and if you don't then you know sucks to be you I mean it really sucks you'll
never forget that if you actually do it on accident and I have I mean you know
you've been I've been around for a while and so I've made some really doozy
mistakes in my day just because they get you going fast on stuff so so and that
was you know a tangent I didn't want to do but how do I remember everything
directory into under recursively so we know that the RF is not going to work
on really important directories and we but the the more important thing is how
do I remove a directory this is what I really want you to learn okay so you
should the moral of the story is this don't use RM-RF it's a bad idea most of
the time you don't need it I'm people are gonna yell at me but you most of the
time you do not need it they're like why I don't want to use our under our
under is for wimps right yeah don't do that that doesn't work we already talked
about this with somebody else is trying to troll us and we just went through a
whole thing and they just joined us and they think they're being cute they are
like a dime a dozen on twitch people who think that the RM commands and then
pretty soon they'll put the the when we talk about processes I'll put the fork
bomb in there and it's it's not cool just it's not cool okay so this is how you
actually remove a directory and why why should use that first why should you
learn how to use our under and I know people people love to like talk shade
about RM der right they do all the time they like talk shade about RM der all
the time oh that's a useless command blah blah blah blah the reason you have to
use our under is because RM doesn't work right RM very strictly speaking we'll
show you and now you can you can pretend like you know more than 90% of the
Linux and Unix people out there because you do okay RM is for moving files and
directories but as you can see it doesn't work on a directory for good
reason because it's dangerous right you may be if you're removing a directory
you want to be you want to know what you're doing so use learn to use the
specific commands now this is going to remove this just fine all right but
here's what it doesn't do and this is this is super important so let's actually
make smaller names here foo let's touch a file in there foo some and foo other
so now we have two files right and by the way if you want to see what those
files are you can just do foo like that and it'll show you all the files that
are in there that's one of the convenient uses of find I've also loaded tree
which does not come with it usually which is a prettier version of just that
kind of output if you want to do that so and you can see here that we have all
that stuff so what I'm what I'm trying to tell you is that if I try to arm der
foo now it's not going to do it it's like no you got stuff in there now what
is the proper way to do that right like oh in fact let me let me give you a
more realistic scenario okay so you've got foo some and you're gonna move foo
some to foo dot hidden all right and you'll go into foo and you'll be like
so the proper way to do this is to remove each individual file and confirm
that you want to remove that file using RM this is the right way to do this it
takes longer but it's the right way to do it and here's the reason unless you
have thousands of files in there and that you're super confident could be
removed then most of the time you're gonna want to individually remove or
move each one of those files and this process that I'm going through doesn't
just apply to the RM command it replies to get commits or any time that you're
deleting stuff if you want to save yourself and they will not tell you
this on the internet all those internet streamers and everybody they won't go
through this professional workflow with you they will give you you know the
command and say goodbye but the proper thing to do here is to explicitly in
your brain make sure that you're deleting the right thing as you do it
because I guarantee you you're gonna delete something you didn't want to
delete and you won't be able to get it back unless you do this so burn into
your brain and explicitly deleting each individual file by itself up to the
point where you're really really sure and the first time by the way the first
time you're sure that you can just remove a whole directory I guarantee you
you're gonna delete something that you didn't want to remove and you're gonna
be like oh it's not in git oh my god I am I am like totally dead and we're
learning how to not delete stuff
yeah yeah yeah that's what you get hex yeah people if you join into the middle
and don't read the room I'm gonna roast you it's just something I do I love you
I do I love you but if you if you if you if you jump in and start offering
advice and haven't even read the room or find out what we're talking about I'm
gonna roast you because that's like if you do that in IRC chat God help you
alright so we're in here I know people are like God this guy's mean so so there
you go LS-A we see there's a hidden file right so so if I come out here and I do
RM at you right RM foo it's gonna like nope that's a directory oh yeah it's
horrender foo so we do that I was like it's not empty bullshit it totally is
empty look LS foo is nothing there LS-A foo oh there's a file still there anyway
let's do this let's do RM foo slash dot hidden and we're gonna you know do that
right so now can I do it LS foo LS-A foo we could do find foo all right well
it doesn't look like there's anything in there let's write again foo all right
now you know how to do it it's gone okay that has been a rant about why you
should do RMDurr instead of RM-RF like lazy assholes who end up deleting stuff
they didn't want to remove including me so don't do it just use RMDurr it's
annoying I know it's annoying just learn to do it okay it's the same reason you
should learn to do touch for make new files so you can make sure you're in the
right place before you open up the I write 20 lines of code and can't save it
because you're in the wrong place and you don't know how to write it to
temp foo temporarily and then move it to where you want there are certain things
that that I'm gonna tell you to do that are gonna save you heartache later even
though they don't make any sense and are not technically required and that's one
of them okay so how to remove a directory RMDurr right so I'm gonna put a
thing here I'm gonna put I'm gonna put an admonition here okay this is an
admonition note if we put a note let's do note this is not marked down this is
this is make dog stuff we're gonna put a note here let's say
prefer RMDurr over over alternatives to force yourself to be sure of each
individual thing that is being deleted within that directory since RMDurr will
not remove directories in them what's it what's a hidden directory that most
commonly will stop a directory from being removed I'll tell you one dot get
dot get dot get is a hidden directory that's used by get when we get to get
process management you'll see it and that's one that regularly I'll think
that I'm cleaning out a repo and that doesn't have anything in it but I want
to keep the repo history and I don't want to delete it or something and there's
still a dot get directory in there and you definitely don't want to delete
that you better know what you're doing with that one all right so how do I
remove directory without removing it recursively if you really do I'm gonna
put another note here danger so even though wait all right so even though this
command does not work on significant system directories like slash it is very
recursively destructive and should almost never be use use RMDurr instead and
everyone's gonna tell me that I'm full of it and they're gonna do it anyway well
now you've been warned you do it it's at your own risk and I told you why okay
and I'm not gonna judge you if you do it if until you delete delete everything
and then I'm just gonna laugh all right so how much time I got we got we got about
half an hour that's fun okay okay so
dot get how many times have you deleted dot get somebody actually admitted to
having deleted their dot get directory on accident because they used RM dash RF
which would be me just telling you just do it all right so anyway this is why
people who have actual work experience as opposed to media marketing degrees
should be making more videos and I'm not just talking about me I'm pointing at
you if you are a professional Linux or Unix user start making YouTube videos in
your underwear slash pajamas like me because we need to hear from you we
don't need to hear from yet another person who wants to spend you know two
hours making the video and zero time actually learning how to do this stuff
in the video sorry that was harsh I was really harsh so always push as soon as
you're done oh my god how many times have you done that you like you're just
deleting stuff around you're like on you're on autopilot you do get pushed
and you're now you've committed into your cemetery this is why this is why
commit to main is disabled and why the PR is a mandatory process and I'll get
these days because once people get used to all these these processes they end up
not only do they end up deleting stuff but then they commit it to the source
tree you know and then stuff happens bad things happen okay so let's talk about
let's talk about users and permissions or you have ZFS file system yeah no no
no no no live through that live through butter FS and all the others all the
other attempts to make it to make it good the the proper way to make it good
is to not be dumb in the first place and I'm talking to me by saving save
yourself from yourself all right right so let's do this let's do the next one
so let's talk about we've already done route and user group precious so I'm
going to give you a whirlwind tour of this thank you for the sub and we're
gonna we're gonna go through this okay so up until now officially you don't
know that you have another user on the system okay so this is gonna be very
hard for me and I want the people in the chat to help me keep it simple it's
very hard because we have a lot of veterans in the chat who will throw in
extra extraneous information is going to confuse beginners but I want you to
pretend like you're talking to someone who's never used the command line before
who doesn't even know what a user is who is regularly on you know Mac or Windows
and doesn't even know that there are different users they just get onto the
system and they log in is they click on a button and they start using the system
that's the time that's the target user that we have in mind when we're talking
about this stuff so I'm gonna say things they're gonna be very simplified and
they're gonna not be complete and they're not gonna be comprehensive and stuff
deliberately because that's who I'm speaking to and if that's you put your
ears on and listen if it's not you and you're one of these pedantic you know
veterans who wants to set me straight just put that aside for a second okay
because we're gonna be talking to the absolute beginners the absolute
beginners all all they know is that they've got a user account and they're
on here now we've talked about what the prompt is before which is review so this
is the name of the user in this case the name of the user on our default
container is user right and then we have an at sign which is just a tradition
that separates the user from the name of the machine that they're on this is the
host name of the machine this is not really a machine but that is technically
the host name and if you're wondering with that why that looks like an email
address is because that's where email addresses came from in fact on multiple
user systems in the early college days or DARPA days you would have multiple
machines and they would have different you know extensions on the end here dot
edu.com or something and this right here referred to the different machines so
you could be talking referring to a user on a separate machine and you can
believe it or not yeah you could send chat chat back in 1979 or 82 or something
like that I mean chat's been around way way way longer than people protect you
know consider then we have here this is like the end of the prompt and it tells
you where you're at the current prompt that I have only tells you the active
current directory you're in until the means that I'm in the home directory and
we already know about this from PWD then I am in the user home directory now you
probably already know PWD if you want to do something fun you can come up here and
do an LS and you can see that LS-AL you can see okay I've got nothing in here
except for the user directory right so there's only one now a user on a system
so back in the old days used to have lots of users and if you ever use anything
for hacking in Carnegie Mellon or these multi-user systems on Bandit there's
something over the wire you will recognize you'll be able to see a
multi-user system we are not going to go into detail about multi-user systems
beyond about five minutes of explanation about what that means because as a user
you usually don't care right the only reason you do care is for the sake of
your own safety if you're on a multi-user system which were not for the
boost so we're not going to go into deep deep stuff there but it's an essential
that you understand it in order to see these things here and then you can learn
about you know how to manage users and how to create new users and how to own
other users elsewhere we're not going to be covering that in the boost I do talk
about it on Twitch every Christmas I've been doing the bandit and showing
people how to hack different user accounts but that's but that's not going
to be part of the boost it's hard for me not to do it so so these user accounts
as you can see generally get a home directory okay and the home directory
is copied from something called Etsy skill and another thing we're not going
to cover officially like why didn't it read everything let's do dash D okay
a stew dash LD alright so Etsy skill is where contains all of the stuff that any
new user gets on the system okay that's system administration knowledge for the
most part but that helps you understand where all these files come from now the
main reason I'm telling you this is if you accidentally delete any of these
files on the container obviously you can start a new container but if you if you
have screwed up one of these files you can go get a fresh copy right so let's
let's do it shall we so like let's let's delete a file so in fact I'm gonna put
this in here I'm gonna put a thing in here it's like how do I see how do I
recover a broken a how do I say this broken or deleted configuration file okay
that's so the answer to this for you is that you can go into Etsy skill so let's
say I mean we haven't we haven't we're gonna go into all of these files in
detail we're gonna explain everything that's in them but I'm gonna tell you
right away now that we know about move how you can fix that okay so let's say
let's delete one that that you know what let's let's let's do this safely let's
do this safely let's let's do our other thing that we learned which is to make
a temporary container and then we're really gonna beat up thing up okay so
let's let's do that that's more it's safer it's more safe in fact I have it in my
history let's push up there let's go run another one so again the dash dash RM
makes it temporary and we know this is a temporary container because of this
here right so now we have a temporary container with this you know cool
prompt and everything and let's just rip at the shreds shall we all right so
remember I'm on the right container now let's see what happens if I delete the
directory how about we delete the input RC no let's just let's just randomly
delete stuff let's delete back we're gonna learn about them but let's do it so
RM dash bash RC now believe it or not that doesn't affect us why because we
haven't started up a new a new shell right and the important thing about this
is that when you delete things they don't affect you until you try to log back
in but in this temporary container there is no logging back into it right so one
of the ways to start and this is kind of this is kind of early to do this but
it's like how do I start a new shell and replace the currently running one this
is not something I was gonna cover yet and I'm just gonna do it anyway I don't
care this is how I am I'm very you know out there so you're gonna do exec bash
L do not forget the dash L all right so that gives you a new shell so we need to
know that because if we're gonna delete so we have this new shell right but well
let's pretend like we're logging in exact bash shell and it's still actually
no it's still use the old one it's still using the old one right that's not
gonna work we need to we need to break something more all right oh wait I'm on
skill stack oh see I just did the thing I told you I wasn't gonna do thank God I
didn't remove anything I do not want to be a poster child for this all right so
yeah okay I almost did it I almost deleted my skill stack image that would
have sucked yeah no no no do not source no no no no no don't do that don't do
that do exec bash national no because all that does is add it to the existing
one there we go all right so and the reason you need to do that because so so
that's what happens if you're if your file goes away all right so so look what
I look what I have here I have no colors where my colors go now the reason you
don't have any colors is you just deleted your configuration file and but but
so you remember that user stuff so let's let's actually restore it now I don't
think have we learned how to copy please tell me we learned how to copy files did
we not learn how to copy files last week I'm all over the place I'm sorry if you
don't like this there's other places you can learn it oh wait there's not I thought
I thought we did copy already I guess not all right well we'll manipulate all
of this into one file later but so okay so I guess we're gonna have to put in
here how do I copy copy a file okay so we're gonna use copy copy I could have
swore we did that file to a new name or you can also copy it new name or
directory if you it's anything with move that we didn't do I'm gonna just I'm
gonna I'm gonna we don't know about we also don't know about globbing yet
because I'm all over the place and we're running out of time right so let's do
this so not this one we want this guy okay so PWD make sure we're in the right
place home user right so we're gonna copy Etsy skill dub bash RC to dot now
what is that you guys remember you need to use the dash L yeah that show the
crazy login show and it's just it's a much faster way to get everything and
especially if your bash RC resets all the environment variables and aliases
like mine does yeah so yeah the dot means the current directory so now we've
got it it's like but mr. Robert didn't fix it in my my thing is still broke
exec bash dash L boom yay we're all good we're good to go why because we restored
a file that was in Etsy scale back okay so that's again that's not something
that most people are gonna cover but it's a good way to know that if you if you
want to know what the default is on a system you can go in there and look at
it now as I said we're gonna go in here and look at all this stuff right and
there's other things you can break in here that might have different effect you
know like dirt colors and an exact bash dash L it'll reload it and you don't see
that until you try to list things so if you try to do dash AL or slash or
something so you see the colors a little bit different they're not too bad but if
you wanted to put the intercolors in there you get a copy Etsy scale their
colors into current actually so I don't even know if it's gonna change the
colors some of them because there's there's already a default so that might
not change it oh it did you see it did it change the colors slightly not a lot
but it did definitely change the colors now what happens when I exit the shell
my container goes poof right because that's why we left the name a temporary
name because we are just using that to practice destructive things it's the
reason we learned about containers that little thing where you spin up a
temporary container to try things out to trying to do that with a virtual
machine is possible but it takes phenomenally longer to do that you'd
have to wait around for the new thing you could stick a snapshot and make a
copy of it's extremely complicated so just a note there that the reason that
we're using containers for this kind of level of learning is because of that
because it's so easy to fire up a new one and try different things out even
try different distros out right Linux distributions and that is not as easy
with virtual machines where some machines are powerful and there's lots of
reasons to use them but that's that's they're a little bit too heavy for this
so that's why we're using containers this year and every year from now on and
okay so by the way for example people are mentioning Z shell if you wanted to
practice Z shell and install it in a container that's something you can do
okay but right now we're learning bash which is the standard shell on the most
important Linux distributions on planet Earth Ubuntu and Red Hat don't let
anybody tell you differently those are the only two distributions you need to
care about as a beginner because those are the number one and two distributions
used by the enterprise for actual jobs everything else is cool and fine and
fun to play with but irrelevant when it comes to getting a job in the
enterprise so anyway how do I search it from within a file command line let's
go back to globbing though before we keep doing this true but sad there's a lot
of people that don't like that that's true and just to be to be fair there was
a time when you couldn't use Linux without getting fired so times have
changed who knows maybe sometime your favorite Linux distro will be in the
enterprise but not today so how do I create a new directory we did that we
were going to get back to globbing so let's get back how do I create a new
temporary sandbox we did that how do I move multiple files what's globbing
okay so we started removing files so we can move them let's go back to that
particular point all right so we're back in home user well we were talking
about different users and I feel bad because I kind of split the topic here I
tell you what let's go back to globbing really quickly I did cover it quickly but
I want to re hit it and then we'll come back to the user thing okay so let's go
back now notice I just put CD enter to the there's at least one advanced person
out there who's been doing CD tilde their whole life and today they just learned
they can do CD enter and it does the same thing every time on every version of
Unix and Linux I didn't learn that till I was 40 something I and I've been typing
that extra tilde every time all that all the total milliseconds I've lost doing
that so yeah CDs they see you with no argument takes you back home every time
don't bother typing the tilde it's too hard to type anyway anyway so yeah I
mean yeah there's there's people who have been doing stuff for a long time this
is why we do this I I've learned so much from from others and we got a lot of
little tricks here up firstly too I'll show you later
this is a dollar home yeah no okay so here we go we got a user we're back in
our directory and let's talk about moving multiple files okay so let's say
that we made a couple scripts in fact let's actually write some scripts to
give you kind of some stuff they could look forward to and we're going to write
our scripts entirely from the command line yeah we're going to write our
scripts it's going to be shell scripts right we're going to echo echo hello
world to we're going to say hello how about this we'll make let's say say
hello with that and then we're going to write another script from the command
line world say world right lsl we got our scripts now this is the part where
you don't know yet but we're going to learn it later so we need to turn them
into scripts are not right now so schmod plus x is the only schmod command you
ever need to know as a beginner for now and then we're going to do schmod plus
x world I could have done that you know in one command in fact I could have done
it like this yeah have you very careful with that because what happens something
else is in there so that's our glob we already starting to use our glob stuff
right now we can actually run them say hello oh it's not running we're getting
ahead of ourselves but I'm getting ahead of ourselves you need to dot slash to
say I want to run it right here right and I can do this I want to say say dot
slash say world and we could do this this is really weird and only does the
first one what yeah so yeah so the whole point of that though was what we want to
make it so that we we need a directory called scripts right make directory
scripts whoops and we're going to move them in there all right so and okay so
there are the advanced people have fun in the chat so oh man how do I get those
two files into the scripts directory now I could drag it and drop them with my
desktop right no don't do that so we're gonna use our move command now you'll
remember we use the move command to rename a file I mr. Rob it's MV why
doesn't it rename there's no rename I don't even think there is a command called
rename there isn't right so move is the rename command and a lot of these
commands by the way are the same on Windows not all so if you do move if
you say I wanted to say I want to do the long way to hide away say hello tab
scripts tab right and then I if I really lazy I push up arrow and say I go back
here with my arrow keys and I say tab again I get world and now they're both
there that didn't take too long but there's actually a faster way to do that
right so I'm gonna move everything in scripts here what is dot dots the current
directory all right so now it's all here again right and believe me let's do
this let's do tree all right there's all our files let's do tree so there's our
I mean as our hidden files do but whatever so they're there okay so what
if I do want to do the most of those in one command so we're gonna use our we're
gonna use our our globs right our wildcards so say star scripts and not
too complicated doesn't tell you anything now by the way what if there was
already something there you know yeah let's do that all right so let's do that
let's make a new one so echo hello world to say world all right so now we
have a new file plus I say world so we make it so we can run it command not
found oh oh pretend you pretend you don't know this yet all right there okay
so there we go say world right hello all right so now watch move say world what's
gonna happen what is gonna happen people what's gonna happen I want you to see
this because you will do this very happily it just overwrote it now maybe I
wanted to do that maybe I will have a new version I was like oh I just want to
put that version in place the other one which is usually the case in my case but
sometimes it's not and sometimes you forget that you named it the same thing
so now when I try to run my script scripts slash say world hello world we
get the other one you never forgive yourself for not knowing that well but
oh CD path yeah CD path is amazing we're gonna talk about that later but we're
gonna go through configuration so this everybody should know right so that's
it all right now what if what if I don't know if I do so so let's try some new
things okay so let's let's try I mean I don't know let's say date let's put let's
say we want to put the date a date I'm just having fun here I'm trying to think
of one that we could do
invalidate I don't you don't know day yet so let's I'm just trying to make up
something oh is it dashi no it's not it's format is it I ISO format anyway the
dates of one command you can do lots of cool things with it and yeah so here's
here's like here's the date command right so you can put this you know
different cool things in here what I was trying to do is trying to make a script
so let's actually let's make two scripts touch I don't know I'm trying to think
of two and two Tom and and and and tall Tom this is how you know it's not
scripted I did not prepare for this all right let's say I want to make those I
don't even know what those are those are those are scripts that we want to have
go into the script directory they're not really so what let's say I want to let's
let's say the classic so how how do I make both of them executables at the
same time shmahd plus X you don't know that but if that was a command I do what
TT right alright so it's like hmm I could just do that right magical magical now
they don't have anything in them you can actually run them they're valid scripts
they just don't do anything and you see I change it was the same time right let's
say I wanted to change only the one I only wanted to leave the one that's got
the extra L in it and let's say let's say Tom to top them top them right so let's
say I want to change only the ones that have four characters right so or I want
to remove them right so remove and by the way another secret I'm going to put a
secret here do-do-do-do-do-do-do I say remove a file I'm going to put a secret
here tip when working with destructive commands that operate on many files try
ls first to make sure it only affects the files you want another thing I'm not
going to tell you they're not going to tell you this they don't tell you all
the ways to avoid getting really screwed up but you now know so so how would I do
that so I would do ls okay I think that I want to do this all right is that it
yeah right and if I wanted to see him all on the same line I could do a dash one
and like doing a select before an update in SQL absolutely absolutely it's just a
good practice to get into whether it's operating from the command line or using
SQL databases the idea of seeing what's going to be matched first instead of
just trusting yourself is a really good habit to get into so so to p.m. I mean
these are the things they need to keep you employed okay there you know the
skills will get you the job but the you know there's the checking yourself stuff
it's gonna skills is what's gonna have you keep the job so so there you go now
you know that it's gonna delete those two I regularly do this when I'm doing a
fine command and you don't know this yet or four commands do echo I done this
this concept of of seeing what it's gonna do first is very very common right so
if I were gonna do some complicated thing and I I actually sometimes will do
an echo of the command that I'm actually gonna remove if I wanted to do some
you know complicated command to everything I'll just you know see what
the output would be first and something it's cool about this is that I could
actually just remove the river then it'll do it now you don't know for loops
yet we're gonna learn that we're gonna be the one-line for loop master of the
universe before the end of this boost and that with that is the true magic
as soon as you start seeing four loops and stuff like that on the command line
that's when you really really really start so that to to leverage the command
line all right so anyway some enhancing commands alright so so let's go ahead so
we can actually we already know our LS I can go back up in my history and I'm
just gonna well you don't know about it yet so we'll do vi mode next later I'm
coming up I'm going up up up to see here okay so that command I know it was
safe I can change the LS to an RM and that will remove those two files and
then do an LS to confirm and those files are now gone okay so with regard to
globbing the only thing you need to know is the wild card which is a star and the
single wild card which is a question mark and we have yeah somebody's already
said how many times do we have to go through this yet another noob has put
sudo rm-rf slash etsy in the chat I'm telling you the noobs are out in force
today on twitch they really are it's so funny they come in they don't even read
the room they don't know we covered it already and then they they think they're
cute they think they're so funny you know that won't work right and if you
really want to we really care go back and watch the video where I made fun of
the last person you suggested that you've done slash in a real sir yeah well
most servers won't let you do it and I already did a whole video about that so
go back and watch that if you care lots of people just joining us yeah there are
lots of them I'm telling you they come up they come out in force they'll think
they're so cute they they do they think they're so funny they're like the kids
in Minecraft you like destroy all your stuff and run away until someone does it
to them and then they're not happy anyway so back to stuff that matters so that's
how you remove a file how do you we did the complicated names thing we did had a
rename a file directory move this so the one of the things to know about move
okay so I'm going to put this in here how how do I move multiple files into a
single directory this is a different use case from just renaming a file so I'm
going to make a thing for that and so many people think this is super remedial
and I apologize but they need to learn it this way okay so we're gonna do SH
here and now we're gonna move those files so you want to move you know a
glob or you know you could do like a file or directory right so it's a it's a
file or a directory I'm doing man page style stuff so my this means one or more
files are directories into a directory alright so the way that I'm drawing that
I want you to look it up because when you when you when you look at man and V
you'll see they just put a bunch of options here and see the dot dot dot that
means you have multiple options it the source is yeah it says source dot dot dot
so we could write it that way let's let's actually write it that way yeah let's
write it that way that's a little bit better so let's do move wait did I kill
my move I did I'm on four okay here we go so let's say move source and one more
source is into the directory okay and between CD slash oh yeah that's a huge
big one so there we go do well as into a single directory so so yeah we have so
let's say we want to make a new directory we got a scripts directory got
multiple files in there we'll move our Tom and we want to move those files into
a new directory right and we can do that yeah yes read man pages that was
good knowledge yeah okay make directory new scripts okay so now we have two
directories and we don't have the color we can look actually if you don't want
to see all that crap you can do LS-AL star scripts right and now if you want
to get rid of the the the well that's good enough so you can see that they're
actually that put all the stuff inside of the scripts if you put a deal just
show you the scripts themselves you can read all about that in man LS and so
that is rather than showing you the content of it when you list a directory
by default it'll show you the content of the directory as opposed to the
directory perms itself which is why I put a D in there and I should probably
put that into the I know it's taking me a long time so how do I list properties of
a directory instead of content all right let's do that doo doo doo sh sh and
we'll do LS-ALD and then the directory name okay so that was a fast one I again
this recipe approach is going to be easier in your search results to find
etc all right so let's keep going back yeah yeah and let's go so let's go here
and we've got scripts so again the goal is to do everything in scripts LS scripts
into new scripts and we don't have anything in there so we're gonna use our
glob now some of you know how to do this already right yeah this is going on
YouTube of course yeah we're starting week zero actually if you want to get
started right away and you want to skip everything do the quick start and then
come join us so we're gonna move we're gonna move everything in scripts so check
yourself what am I gonna put right here start right move everything in scripts
into everything in new into new scripts now could I have written this out
individually yes say I could do this too right if I just wanted to move all the
stuff to say in it I could do it that way right but if I want everything in
there I do star and then it's going to move it into there now when we do LS
scripts and we do LS new scripts we see that they're flipped right you do the
same thing in reverse if you want and and that's you know that's it now let's
actually let's actually complicate things right so let's put Tom in there let's
let's put a fool in there all right or more importantly here's it here's a
really big one oh my god this is gonna be a fun one
your Christmas we're not gonna use a star star we're not gonna learn star
star in the booze no too dangerous yeah no not Tom I know so let's do this this
is very common okay so let's say we I'm gonna let's let's reset let's reset so
let's put a new scripts okay into the scripts directory I this I cannot tell
you how many times I've done this this is a very common way to blow away I get
repo okay so let's pretend let's pretend let's pretend that the scripts
directory is under git management that means it has a directory in it called
scripts that dash get very important directory very important directory all
right doesn't have anything in it right now okay so let's let's let's let's put
something in there just for fun so you get very important I'm important I am
important okay nothing there but just just so you get the point right find dot
oh gosh let's do find scripts actually let's do you find star scripts is that
gonna work let's do find dash dash name scripts you don't know this yet okay
anyway so I'm trying to make it LS scripts okay so so oh this is perfect
this is perfect okay all right this okay so here's the scenario right you are
making a new get repo you want it to be a nice clean keeper repo and you want to
take the files from the one repo and put it into a new one all right and so you
have these two directories that have a get repo in them make directory that we're
gonna get dead today I guess not so new scripts dot get yeah and we're gonna do
new scripts dot get don't delete very important okay so let's I'm gonna show
you all right so yeah yes okay that's what I'm trying to show you okay so so so
you think you're like nice and safe here right so LS scripts and you forgot to do
an LS dash AL scripts which would show you that you have other files in there
right and you do LS dash AL new scripts there's your new scripts there's nothing
there right so the first thing to take away from this is when in doubt be more
precise right and also use the LS things to test things out so so in this case
what would be better I mean right off the bat scripts say star we know we want
those two specific scripts and we want them in our new scripts that will work I
don't need to tell you that you already know it right that is not going to grab
that get but let's say you're lazy and you just do this right and you do new
get and I want you to see this new scripts and get directories not empty so
we got saved a little bit thank God now thank God if you had a dash F in there
when it would not do that would not be happy it's like wait the dot get
directories not empty I don't want to overlap it right it's like oh shoot okay
I'm not supposed to do that I don't know let's try with the dash F I don't even
want to show you this but I think it will still do it no thank God okay good
well that's good but it is very common to do that so but more likely what would
happen would be something like this let's say let's say that it in the new
scripts directory you haven't made it a giveaway but yet alright so we're gonna
deliberately delete that directory and we're gonna do it the right way if I
try to remove get what's gonna happen nope can't do it yet so let's this would
be one of those cases were removed dash RF would work that's super dangerous though
so let's do this let's remove new scripts dot get and don't delete oh no I just
deleted it now I can do a rm durr on dot get I'm safe but now watch our move
command remember that move command we had now yes there is it's called no
clover but we are not going to use it because it's not on everything and you
shouldn't become trustworthy of it in my opinion so so we're gonna try to move
that do the same thing we did before right okay what I just did I cannot tell
you how many times I've done this I cannot tell you how many times the tennis
I'm sort of embarrassed it's like oh hey it worked right it didn't work it works
they worked a little too good right why did it work too good right and so you
might come in here and do something like this right so then you then you come
in this is a very common mistake beginners make all the time so you go
go into new scripts right this is gonna be your new repo and you try to go make
a new get where you don't know how to do this yet but you're getting it and it's
like sorry initialize get repository in new scripts dot get right and then you
go back you go back into your old scripts directory which you think is
still a repo right and you do get status and it's like there's no get repo you're
like what did I do what you did is use the star which match the hidden dot get
repo and now it's been moved and now you just blew it away now thankfully you can
restore it but if you haven't committed and pushed anything so so the point of
this is be super careful with what you're gonna move over there right and one
of the reasons to have a get under get management that I'm kind of doing this
on purpose because when we get to the get management that's one of the surefire
ways to see if you've done something wrong and what I mean by that is this so
I could find I'm it's like we're gonna hit ourselves a little bit so so this is
in a get repo right and yeah I shall show this is actually the website we're
working on and it has a dot pages there's no dot get there but if you go up high
enough you'll see the dot get repo and the point of trying to say that this
sometimes you want to know if you've actually changed anything so it's just
kind of a backup so you do get status and that will show me every single file
that's been modified when it was file modified and if I wanted to see the
differences I would do get diff and that would show me exactly what was
changed in every file every thing you do should be managed with git so we still
need to learn how to edit files and stuff but I just want to take a moment to
tell you that that's why because that will save you from the kind of disaster
which I just created by by remuting those files right because we just blew we
just move that git file away and since I did under new scripts ironically you'll
still see that inside of here is now very important is the file that we created
and there's all these extra files that get made for us which you don't need to
understand right now but you just need to know that they're there okay the
religion to talk to yes they get religion I mean it's got it's got its
quirks but you know it's there for us to use so that was kind of a long-winded
way of of showing you some of the ways to move things around it that that was
specifically to answer the you know the stuff about whoops exit this that was
specifically to show you about this how do I move multiple files into a single
directory that is how you do it now where it says source you know you could do
instead of source you could do I mean what my source it the source can be either a
path a name or a glob okay so we should probably put that there can be can be a
file directory Pat or path to add or a glob okay that's that's the only thing
take away from that I think we're almost done it we're past time for sure so we
are not going to make it to manipulating files we did we did we did move
multiple files we did that yes we did yeah we did that one okay what else we
got so I think we're gonna be done today that's a lot for you to do I mean I
covered a bunch of the the removing stuff is super scary that's why I wanted to
go through it what is the minimum I need about user user permissions to be
productive I think we're gonna start that next week it's 119 so we are you know
past time are are we not yeah I think we're past time now so I need to we take
a pretty big break we'd learn how to delete a broken configuration file let's
change the whole permissions thing for next week I know you want to do more I
know you do but I feel like it's probably good for you to do a little bit at a
time and so we do we copy every a file from the directory and copy from Etsy
scale yeah so you can copy Etsy scale file to tilde if you want to or to
wherever your home is and how do I start a new show or place the current one we
did that have a copy file that we didn't do before and how do we just so I think
we're gonna have to go ahead and I mean we learned about copying right copy a
file to a new name it goes without saying that you can actually recursively
copy so let's do that let's do that and we'll be good how do I recursively copy
a directory and subdirectories into another so this this let's do this
recursive copy and we'll be done for today and then we can that's a nice
happy place to leave and and if there's any things I don't know why I've been
typing that today it's just user error all right so for this you're gonna say
source and you can do that same as before and that it's either lowercase
or a couple or I always have to look it up I don't even like to do this because
in fact I'm gonna put a note here I am I'm gonna put a note here so note so the
the main takeaway from this is that this is is not what you think okay so why
is it doing that all right so this creates new files with new creation
dates times and ownership if copying from another user so this is super
important so if you're trying to make a backup this is not a backup there is
dash a dash a is is the archive so but that I don't know if we want it I don't
think okay let's let's actually find out is coffee dash a politics I don't think
it is to do to do I don't think it is I don't think the dash a is politics and
and it's the politics case or specifications um part of the doble
bum no cloud or preserve follows the characteristic source path anyway you
guys can look up the copy command the the R the capital R lowercase R is
recursively recursively copies directories there are other ways to do this in
Linux using two stars if you know how to do that but for right now that we want
to stick with the thing with the Unix is sometimes there's multiple ways to do
it and you have to find the one that's going to work not only for Linux but
also Unix so you can learn just the one thing and have it work everywhere I tend
to use that show our capital R but as you can see they both works in different
places so we are actually going to do a little experiment here and I I want to go
test something new yeah politics doesn't have dash a we are going to actually use
a very for the sake of experimentation we are going to run a busybox an Alpine
which is using busybox temporary we're going to use a container and we're
going to go test what Alpine Alpine does not use bash as a shell uses politics
which is kind of nice because as a Unix distribution and I would call it
Alpine probably the third most popular containerized distribution and why do
you care well because it's a good way to test whether you should learn something
and how you should learn it because if it doesn't exist on Alpine is a good
chance you want to learn a different way that will work on Alpine and BSD and
Unix and and everything else right and that's we haven't gotten into politics
and Linux and Unix history yet really but but the the point is you you only want to
learn it once and a lot of times the best way to learn it is to learn the way
that works on all Unix variations as opposed to just one and that's why I'm
kind of pausing here so so we're actually going to go test this now you know how to
do all the cool stuff to test something temporarily right run it and and we're
going to say dash dash rm because we don't want the container to hang around
later and we're just going to run Alpine now Alpine is a standard distro which
means it's hosted on Docker hub which means you can don't have to type all
the extra crap and I already had the image downloaded so I didn't have to
download it and you can see I have you know this is this is Linux but it's
Linux modeled after BSD Unix which has no GPLv3 in it by the way one of the
reasons I really love it and you can so you can see there's a bunch of stuff here
but the really the thing that we care about is is the is the copy command now
there are no man pages here because this is a very minimal thing there's is there
a dash h okay yeah so as you can see copy is just a rename it's a multi call
binary for busybox they're all the same single binary executable file you
don't you probably don't care but that's important because that just means that
depending on how that file has been renamed or relinked it does something
different it's a pretty cool thing that is used to save on space busybox was made
back in the days when all of Linux or it was busybox was the first Unix
distribution to fit on a single floppy disk and and to that I don't I don't
expect they were ever anticipating the success it has in 2023 because it's so
small but that makes it very great for using for making really tiny containers
that feel like Unix or Linux but don't really have Unix or Linux and that's
what that's what busybox is and I'll find so the reason we're here though is we
want to see whether we should use dash r or dash a or dash p okay so as you can
see all of these are supported in busybox in the latest version of busybox
that does not mean they're pyosix compliant though yes there is no
bash of course there's no there's only a shell yes so but that's why we're here
is we want to see if that command is the same so here we see that DPR recursive
preserve permissions and preserve sim links you don't know that but so this
really was supposed to be just a really tiny little call out to why you should you
know not necessarily depend on things this creates new files with creation
days ownership if copying with you crazy I'm gonna just put use other copy
argument options when preserving them is important I'm just gonna put a note here
okay because again you're a beginner you really don't care I feel bad that we
have already gone so far I've been on discord for a long time yeah so how do I
recursively copy a sort of every so you can recursively copy the source again the
source can be a thing and then you need to put a directory now this is another
way you can really seriously delete things in fact because it will copy it
all over on to the top of that of that other thing whatever you're copying on
to right so you know just put a directory here right make sure it's a
directory another thing that I've done with the MV command before is having a
whole bunch of things that you want to move into a directory so let's let's do
that let's do this one how do I recover a book and delete a config file we did
that where's the move multiple things where's the move multiple things move
a directory to a source okay so let me show you another one another danger here
this is why it's taking so long
danger when moving multiple source sources make sure that Der is a directory
and not a file I cannot tell you how many times I've seen people be burned by
this all right so it's same goes with copy but but not as much so so here we
go yeah we're gonna go to with scoot the copy so let's say we have I want to
copy all those files and scripts you know they are still are they a new scripts
okay we want to copy them so copy copy new scripts right and we only want to
copy the say stuff and then we want to copy that into scripts right and that
that did it right because it was just the top level stuff I did not it did not
copy an entire directory but let's say I want to copy the whole directory copy
new scripts to more scripts copy dash R not specified emitting directory new
scripts so there it goes it helps you out and you can do the dash R or there's
capital R to do that right and and now LS more scripts and you'll see everything
is there LS dash AL more scripts you'll see that it also got the dot get
directory which it did not do in the first one right so and but I want you
to notice that these are now they got new timestamps on them stuff like that and
we'll go into that when we get in this model a bit later but so so that's all
the stuff that got moved what I was gonna say before let's see if I can show you
this okay so but now let's let's do the same thing with the move command okay
let me let me remind you of another way to really screw up your day okay and I've
done this with SSH actually because SSH uses the same idea of copying to a
thing and if you forget the colon in an SSH command it will actually just make a
copy of the thing instead of actually copying the whole recursive directory so
let's try that now so let's say that we want to do a recursive move so we want
to move and actually I think move as a dash aren't you I don't another thing
about move to is that I don't know if I need to put this do we need to put the
thing about moving across file systems I don't know if we should put that here
yes I'm gonna put it out here people hit this one all the time too probably not
okay note that that envy sometimes will not work because the source and
destination are on different file systems I mean it's just enough right it's
just a note somebody might run into that it's a very esoteric weird thing but
it it I remember as a beginner yeah I remember as a beginner going what the
hell is happening here and then it sometimes it would make a copy I mean
it's very unlikely anybody's gonna hit that I mean it's very unlikely right I
am kind of interested though so for example if I do move scripts as shared
we have a shared mount right so if I do move I'm just curious if I do move
scripts to slash scripts shared I want to see if it does it nope operation up
for a minute there you go yeah yeah so that's the reason it went where we haven't
we haven't done anything with the shared directory yet but that's that's one
reason it wouldn't work yeah this is file directory damn is it gonna be very
interesting yeah yes lvg oh my god everyone's rolling their eyes we did
like a like 20 minutes on it yeah so there's the new scripts right so apparently
that works so that's interesting yeah so mounted so so so mounts work so if you
if you're wondering what just happened we haven't talked about it yet but ever
but the way that we have mounted our container we are sharing a directory with
a directory that's on the host system and the name of it is called shared and
that allows us to transfer files back and forth between our host machine you
know Windows or Mac and and the container itself and so you can move
things back and forth pretty easily so like if you've downloaded something on
the internet you can put it into your container by putting it in that directory
and that's that's what that's for we'll talk more about that a lot later but but
I wanted to see if move was going to be limited by that which apparently is not
so that's good to know and we did the we did the recursive move one the thing I
wanted to show you though is that it's this is actually a very very dangerous
situation added don't do that yeah I mean yeah so so here we go so we have two
files here right and let's say we make a new directory called you know I don't
know say and we want to make a say directory right so we want to move say
now the proper way to do this would be say you know this is interesting watch
what happens when you do this because the director is also named say now I do
that all the time that is not an error that just says I couldn't move the say
directory into itself but it moved all the other stuff in there right so that's
fine all right but let's let's do this a different way so let's let's take all
that stuff out of there and we'll move it back out okay let's remove this
directory say and let's actually make a file name say all right so so for
whatever reason let's pretend that we forgot that we accidentally created a
file maybe because we were just going fast and forgot to do make turns to be
to touch instead and and then what and then we do move say hello well actually
let's do let's do say hello and say world just to be very precise and we want
to move those into the directory say but say it's not a directory what's gonna
happen anybody want to guess anybody want to guess what's gonna happen so it
says it's not a directory now we got lucky in that case sometimes it won't do
that right so let's actually try it with the copy command let's see what let's
see what the copy command does remember remember that what does the copy command
do oh it's not a directory damn we're getting protected thank God that was not
always the case I can promise you so that's good that's good that looks like
they've added some built-in protections that I that we're not there from before
there there are definitely ways to to overwrite that and whether you're you
know whatever just just just be really careful when whenever you're you're
moving something just make sure it's a directory that's the moral of the story
and thankfully we got blocked both times today trying to destroy our world here
you think look like you're doing globs would do it yeah yeah so I don't know
about this one let's try this using say to say it's got to say it's not a
directory interesting I mean that's that's I am I'm kind of happy to run
into that I don't know if that's changed or that's just something I forgot but
but anyway that's the way that you can really you know make yourself have a
bad day is not knowing what things are and again as I've said I have this
problem with the program SCP all the time which there's another command for
copying between a remote system and a local system and if you forget the
semicolon at the end you end up just making a local copy that's the name of
the target destination well when we get into SCP and and SSH those things will
come up let's see we want to try when people have got some other suggestions
or MV say H instead of say into Seder well yeah oh there we go there we go
yeah that killed it didn't it now see that did not do what you were expecting
right that that made there's just there's just a lot of variations the
takeaway is very simple make sure you're dealing with what you think you're
dealing with and you're not always gonna have these pretty colors to show you so
when you do an LS you're not gonna get all the colors you know I know what is
a no-color I forget what is I don't even know I don't know what it is
there's a way to turn color off I'm trying to figure out no color never
there we go so so you might be on a system it doesn't have color enabled right
so that would be color equals never in fact my LS command is actually alias to
color equals auto all the time so why does that matter because let's do it again
so if I move say to back to say hello right get it back to the way it was and
I touch a new fall called say and then I LS oh by the way did you see that you
don't know about that yet our advanced people might want to know this too so if
you do slash say then it turns off all the aliases and types and it just uses
the one that at whatever the path is so so in this case it would be this so you
can just do it if you want to be sure to get the actual binary so so now you
really don't know right there's really no indication that this is directory or
not so then you would have to actually do an LS L D and that just gives you the
current directory so LD star and I'll show you everything in here and let's do
this so we don't get the color so and so you see you see there that oh that's not
a directory alright that's really it and I think that's going to be the end for
today thank you for joining me on YouTube I know that's we've got we went a
long time again we tend to go a little bit longer than usual but hopefully you've
made it through it I've been kind of all over the board there but the point here
is for you to go experiment with everything go play with it I've spent
more time than I wanted to on how to avert disaster today and I think it's
worth it honestly it's not the kind of stuff that people normally talk about
and I've you know created multiple scenarios where you could really screw
yourself up and so hopefully as you're learning it those things will go into
your notes somehow and that they'll stick so you don't end up losing your
job after you get that great job we'll talk to you next week and when we next
week I can already tell you what's going to be on the docket because we didn't
get to it today so next week we're going to be doing searching for stuff inside
of a file and we're going to be starting to edit files and as we go we're going to
be learning regular expression so it may be that we just learn that and that
alone how to look into files how to navigate them how to edit files dynamically
and how to how to you know do do stuff to the files that
alters them in any way really and to do that through a programmatic method as
opposed to necessarily using an editor and then we'll slowly move into how to
use one of those tools from the command line also as an interactive editor and
and then we'll move into VI which will probably be in two weeks and if you
think it's just too slow I'm sorry but it's just my style that's how I do it
hopefully this turns out to be something good for you if you have any
questions you can go hit the discord up I am going to be answering a couple
questions from discord right now I'm not going to do it on the stream and I'm
you know generally here in the discord if you need if you ask question but more
importantly we have a lot of other people there that to whom you can ask the
questions and this will get better every year as we continue to go when we got
your input thank you to our veterans who I gave a lot of crap to who gave us
input thank you including all of those people who suggested RM-RF at least five
of you did and and thank you for reminding me how to show people why that
doesn't matter and we'll see you next week
