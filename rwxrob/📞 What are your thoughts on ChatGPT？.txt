start recording. What are your thoughts on chat GPT? So here's
the thing. Why? That's, that's what I have to say. Why? Why are
people interested in this? I just don't get it. I don't I just
don't get it. I have watched all this stuff. I don't understand
what its purpose is. Personally, I mean, let's go back and
read it. Okay, so it says their chat GPT is a prototype
artificial intelligence chat bot. Join the club. I mean, how
many other chat bots have we had? Okay, so maybe this was not
going to become like a masochistic, narcissistic
Nazi like the Twitter bot before. This is apparently really
polite. I'm sure they trained it to be really, really polite.
Apparently, it's really, really polite. I was scrolling
through a thing and it said, the most polite, you know, clueless
bot you'll ever see. If it's wrong, at least it's wrong
politely. But it focuses on usability and dialogue. The
chat bot uses a large language model trained for and with
reinforcement learning and it's based on GPT 3.5 architecture.
It's also beta, by the way, it's not final, right? It's an open
prototype. Not finished. How about that? So put that there.
Look, if you want to use it, that's fine. I am not going to
judge you. I just think it's waste of time. So many things are
a waste of time today. And to me, that's a waste of time. chat
buddies is like, it says here chat chat chat GPT was launched
in November 2022. And his garnered attention is as its
detailed responses and well reasoned answers, although
it's accuracy has been criticized. Well reasoned wrong
answers.
People are like, I mean, there was an entire article that came
across my feet. It was like, Oh, it's this is the end of essays
as we know them is to have GPT GPT going to destroy, you know,
scholastic achievement through essay writing and stuff. I'm
like, No, it's not. It's not. It's not. I mean, it might help
you a little bit. It's like, it's all of these chat bot
things, including the coding one. All they really are is
they're catering to people who are copy pasta people, copy
pasta people, the people who don't do any original thinking
who go out and they want to use this thing like, Oh, that's
cool. They don't actually validate that it's true. Now, if
they did, if they did, if they did, if they did, then it could
be a nice suggestion, right? And I think that's fine. And it's
not just because I'm old that I don't like it. It's because it's
inaccurate. And it's dangerous to trust an AI that you're not
backing up with personal experience. This is do I have
to I mean, how many fictional sci-fis have there been? This is
part of the evolution of AI, right? I mean, there was a time
there was a time when if you were to hear a computer generated
voice, you would go what the hell did they say? And now you
can't even tell the difference between computer generated
voices. So it's it's going in the right direction. I don't have
any problem with that. And it needs to go in the right direction.
But right now, why are you wasting time on it? And there's
an unusually large number of people coming at me with this.
What do you think of chat GPT? Who are college students? And I
had I had one person in here, I'm going to get them out at me. I
think it's I think they're in here right now. Please don't get
that. But they said, all I can say is it took what was
otherwise a three hour assignment and turn it into 30
minutes. That's exactly what that's almost word for word what
they said. And I'm thinking to myself, how is that possible? How
is that possible that that this thing, whether and I don't I
don't know the assignment, I think it was a coding assignment
that this thing can can. Oh, wow, there's a good one. I've come
up with a set of rules that describe, oh, very cool. A quote
on a tech rail. Oh, we'll have to go look at that one came out.
Yeah, that's very cool. So the point is, is if if if if you
were if it was taking you three hours to do an assignment,
whatever it was before, and it's now taking you 30 minutes,
because you have a chat bot that's helping you out. There's
something wrong. I mean, there's there's something wrong,
you're either not learning it, not learning it properly. Or I
mean, there's an outside chance that it's doing the grunt work
for you. And that you're still doing the learning and it's
filling in all the blanks and everything that it would take
you longer to type, especially if you're like a slow typer or
something. And I suppose there's a certain number of people who
are slow typers who can't compose thoughts very easily. And
it helps them put the language together. And like, yeah, okay,
that sounds right. I this my fear with any of these AI things
is just like any other fear is it's like, they're going to make
us soft. You know, and that's that's been at something that
old people have been saying, you know, just the dawn of time,
there were people who didn't want to get on railroad trains
because they thought it was too fast and everybody was going
to die. A lot of people did die, by the way, there's actually
in Arizona, we open a geocache there, where there were two
trains that that were on the same track. And it was, you know,
hundreds of hundred people radically destroyed in an
instant when their two cranes collided head. So there are
definitely concerns about these these things as they come out.
And, you know, should we be doing it? Yes, we should be
definitely trying them out and experimenting and stuff like that.
But but but to what extent I mean, you know, if honestly, this
chat, I don't know about the coding when this is just a chat
bot, right? But the coding one, which is kind of related in
conversation, that that one will get you fired from a company
if they find out if they're if you're using it. Not just
because you don't know what you're doing, but because it's
based, it's been trained on proprietary source code that has
a undeterminate legal pedigree. And nobody likes to talk about
this. They all like to talk about how cool, you know, open AI
chat is. I mean, all that. I mean, I mean, this is a different
company, right? That's the Microsoft thing. It's the code
whatever. I forget the name of it. But if you're using that,
you're actually taking your career in your own hands. And I
wouldn't tell anybody you are. And I think to a lesser degree,
the chat GPT thing is the same thing. If you let's say, for
example, let's say, for example, that you save three hours on an
essay assignment by using chat, chat GPT, just a party, yeah,
they'll work out the legal issues, the tech is too powerful
not to use. I don't think that's true at all. I must say, I
know you're a huge AI fan. And I am not, I am not a fan of it at
all. To me, it's just, it's just copy past pasta on steroids.
That's all it is. And so what it's causing is it's causing a
bunch of people to not learn shit. And, and that's fine. And
this, I mean, I've said it before, I've predicted that
everybody should be learning AI and how to train models
properly. Because if this is a step in the right direction,
where the number of people are going to be doing actual
programming is going to go down. And there's a story I tell
about this, that that is related to this. Because the way that
AI is are trained, including this one that I've been slamming
on, the way that they're trained is organic. It's closer to
how nature does things than the algorithmic models. And I have
a story about this I want to tell really quick. Imagine an AI
tutor that can teach kids in third world countries. Wrongly,
he'll turn them into white supremacists, you know, they're
in Africa. I mean, if it was a Twitter bot, that's what it
would do. Look, we're getting there, we're getting there,
we're just not there, right? So, so that's what I'm saying.
Better than what we have right now, which is nothing.
Well, I mean, that's like, there's societal ills out there
to look at. I, I'm not anti AI, I'm just like, I'm like, so on
the one hand, I do think we need to learn how to train models
properly. I just watched a huge conference, I almost gave up
where I work. There was this huge, huge conference, full day
conference about AI at the place that I work. And it's crazy,
it's crazy. In fact, the whole future of AI and the focus of
it is not even on writing code, it's on the data, it's on, it's
on, and they went through a bunch of examples of how they were
sampling the data, and increasing the data samples so that
they were good. Because the higher the quality and then put
data, the better the quality AI, and you should see the AI is
they haven't, I wish I could talk about it. I, the AI that is
going down because I, people may not know, I support a machine
learning group. I do the, you know, the SRE and the Kubernetes
stuff, and some of the REST API development for, to support,
you know, high performance computing machine learning
group, and one of the biggest companies in the entire world,
who's, who's radically making radical advantage, taking
radical advantage of AI and data. And it's absolutely amazing.
And they have their own, they're so big, they have their
actually, they have their annual conference on it. And I was
just, I was just there. And it's absolutely phenomenally awesome.
So either I'm going to go camping over the week, over the
Christmas break, I'm actually going to start sticking my, you
know, finger into AI and learning some of the, you know,
doing some Kaggle stuff and learning, if you're not learning
how to do data science and, and, and, you know, this kind of
thing. And all you're focused on is algorithmic programming and
stuff. I mean, you should see how long it takes me. Have you
seen, I mean, it takes me forever to just do basic parsing of a
string or something like that. I mean, I'm, I'm relatively fast,
but the amount of time it takes to, to write code compared to
the amount of time that it takes organically to train a model
and to get the data in place and then let that thing write the
code is, is substantial. And then, you know, Masi and others
here are saying that they're like, this is too powerful for,
for it to not take over. And the chat GPT is, is not directly
related to coding thing. But it's the same idea. The idea is
it'll do the thinking for you and to write your essay for you.
And so I mean, that's, I just, that's on the one side, it's
good on the other side, it's really bad. So let me tell you a
story about the good stuff. Okay, so there, I would give
anything for the reference to this yet. I read this in 2014,
I think it was. And I was studying this philosophical
difference between algorithmic approaches to solutions and
natural organic solutions. And the specific example was, and I've
told the story before, but the specific example was a cam, you
know what a cam is, right? It was a cam like, like a cam
shaft in a car, but it wasn't a car, it was a factory, it was a
factory in the, in, you know, New England someplace in the
Northeast. And, you know, back, you know, where there's a lot of
manufacturing going on in the story goes that they wish I
could find if anybody can find it, please give me a reference.
But the device broke down. And so they the production line was
down. And this is a production line that was, you know, core of
the business, and they were losing all this money. And
well, every day it was down, they were losing money. And this,
this cam, it was this very complicated mechanical process
that had to be done exactly that way had been created somewhat
organically, and it had been tailored, it had been shaved off
and everything. So it had this, you know, very unique cam was
the core, it was the heart of everything on the assembly line.
And they couldn't recreate it. And so they hired, they paid, they
paid all of this money to all these people to do, to fix it.
They brought in theorists, they brought in the Beth
mathematicians, you know, and, and they said, okay, hey, let's,
you know, and they designed lots of failures. And, and, you
know, so they, they would put together all these, these, these
amazing things. And then, and then they didn't work, they just
didn't work, because they weren't organic enough, they weren't
natural enough. So, so then they, they brought in another team,
and I don't remember the specifics of the team. But this
team did the same thing, they recreated the process that was
used to create the first camp. And it took them longer than to
do, you know, to do all the stuff, but it actually worked. And
what they did is they started with something that was the best
approximation of, you know, that they could come up with and
they use this stuff from, you know, the other mathematicians
that people had given them. And they put that in there. And
then they ran it for a while. And then they would go in and
then they would shave that the machinist and they would shave
off part of it. And then they would run it again. And then
they would shave off a little bit more and they would run it
again. And then it was, it was this fail faster idea, right?
And that, that idea of adjusting for failure, and training a
device that that's exactly how machine learning works. So as I
understand it, so, so having that, you know, and that that got
them the solution that they wanted to and that that process,
that process of, of natural learning that that went on, I
mean, natural learning has got a very specific meaning in the AI
world. And that's, I'm sorry, natural intelligence, natural
learning, natural intelligence is the goal. Natural intelligence
is, is when the intelligence is, is, you know, self aware and
everything. And there's a lot of debate about whether that'll
ever be a thing. But, but the point of it was that the organic
approach, you know, fail and adjust, fail and fix, fail and
fix, fail and fix is what got them the solution. And no, no,
no amount of programming and algorithmic thinking is the best
minds could get it. It had to be incrementally done. And I
really appreciate that story, because that's how I do most
things. I'm a very practical guy. I have a hard time. I mean, I
can visualize certain things. But when it comes to like lead
code algorithms and stuff like that, I don't really do well
with them. But if I can see it working, I can modify what's
working and get it to the point where, where it's working. And
if I just look at all the code, I'm like, okay, I understand how
this code's working, because I tweaked it all along the way. And
sometimes there's a refactor along the way in there too,
because, you know, like, hey, you know, this is not as
efficient as it could be. But I, you know, it's, it's avoiding
the premature optimization kind of thing, general
intelligence. Yes, that's what I was looking for. That's three
body problem. And that, yeah, that's the one I was looking
for. So, so, you know, this, these things are all super
fascinating chat chat. GPT is a part of it. It's definitely a
thing that I think needs to exist. I just feel like so many
people are like freaking out about it right now. And I have to
ask myself, isn't there something better you could be
doing with your time? But that that's not my business, do what
you want with your time. I mean, I waste my time plenty good.
So, so, you know, if you want to play around that fine, I
don't, I don't, I have no intention of doing I if I could
train my own chat bot, which I am interested in doing, my goal
with AI is to create my, you know, they say second brain,
right? Second brain is another word for Zettlecasten. So I
have, I've now I'm up to like 1800 content nodes, knowledge
nodes, in my current Zettlecasten, I have three other
knowledge bases that have over 1000 content nodes in each of
them. And I am in the process of bringing all of those over so
it's like almost everything that I've ever written about. And
once I get all of that content in one place, I really want to
see how I could put some machine learning algorithmic stuff, not
machine algorithms, but I want to see if I could build some
machine learning into my own data stuff, right? And then and
then, of course, the extension of this is that, you know, the
exchange grid, the knowledge exchange grid, once I can get,
so let's say, let's say that I have, I know, text pre
generation, stuff like that, right? So I'm already doing
templates and stuff. But I mean, it's very possible that I
could do the template generation automatically through AI. But
something else that's interesting is that interests
me is that is that's just my corpus, right? I just have my
data, my Zettlecast, but but the goal, and then we're probably
like five years out on this is to eventually be able to follow
multiple other people and have a cash copy of their Zettlecast
and with me as well. And, you know, you take that to the
degree, if I've got 1000 people, and there are people that I
personally have curated, my ring of trust about knowledge and
that stuff. Now I've created, now I've created a corpus of data
that that that's extremely compelling when it comes to not
just searching, but making suggestions. And then, then we
could put, is that what they call a chat by utility? Yeah. And
then and then I would put on top of that, I would I would start
to layer in the AI, and then I could have the AI suggest things
to me, or when I start writing about something, I would love
to have another team X window open that's like, dude, you've
already talked about this over here and here and here and
here, here's the only thing and have it dynamically see not
just not just from the keywords that I'm using, which is, you
know, a start. But I want it to like see, well, you know, you've
written similarly to this, or somebody has written similarly
to this, you know, the end, you see this kind of thing already
in like, trouble ticket issues, and stuff like that, that we
submit to GitHub or anything like that, you know, you start
typing things like, are you sure it's not this problem right
here, right? So there's there's already, you know, code to do
this. And that's kind of the, you know, phase two of the whole
keg thing, you know, phase one is to get the knowledge, you know,
really stable and collectible. And that phase two is kind of
exchange it, I guess it's apparently phase three, phase
three would be processing the data, that would be processing all
the knowledge. It's like over for a bandit. They did it for
for the reason of spam. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I just I just would
never want to put it. I mean, it's bad enough having a chat bot,
you know, do one thing. The hardest part about all of this is
going to be being able to determine who's real. And
that's already becoming a thing, right? I mean, I imagine
there's a lot of like, you know, porn and cheating sites that
are going to love these these AIs, because they're just going to
be the best, you know, pretend girls ever. Yeah, NPCs will be
awesome. Yeah, has apps now that check for secrets, check for
dependency security flaws. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's like
there's chat. Yeah, I mean, all of those sorts of things are, are
stuff that I definitely want to add in. So I'm not, it's not
that I'm against chat bots, I'm definitely adding a chat bot. I've
already started adding a Twitch chat bot, which what I want it
to do is like, you know, I have all these commands, right? But I
hate maintaining the commands. So what I would rather have my
chat bot do my my Twitch chat bot, what I would rather have it
do is I would have rather have it become intimately familiar
with my Zettle cast in, right? So if somebody starts chatting
about something, and Moss has already made some really amazing
stuff on this level, if somebody starts chatting about
something, I want my chat bot to score potentially a response
and say, okay, somebody's talking like this, somebody used a
question mark, somebody's doing whatever. And it'll say, if
you're asking about this, this is what I was trying to do,
right? So I would really love to be able to create kind of a
proactive customer service like bot in my Twitch, that answers
all of the mundane questions for me without people having to go
to the commands, right? I mean, they go to the commands, and
then they have to filter through the commands, and they have
to find the right one. And sometimes they do, and there's
kind of a path through there. But I have to maintain all of
that. And maintaining the commands, I actually was looking
at, I've got like 200 or 300 commands. Yeah, if I train it on
my set as my core, yeah, then I would be so so then somebody
asks a question. And, and, and all I have to do is write. I
don't I don't have to go in and create all the interlinking and
stuff like that inside of a specific, you know, commands
database, I just maintain my Zodacast and answer questions
like I'm doing right now, and then include links to YouTube and
stuff like that. And the links are identifiable because they've
got the YouTube emoji on them. So my my chat bot could be
intelligent and say, Hey, well, you know, there's actually these
YouTube videos on this too. And it could proactively engage
with anybody in my chat while I'm, you know, writing and doing
the work. And then I, I mean, it might not be as personal, but
it could be, you know, it could be very valuable. I think, I
think that personal broadcasting as we do it now on this
co-working kind of thing is going to progress. I think, yeah,
take care. It's, I think that this is one of those things that
that is going to progress, and it's going to become more
valuable right now. It's just kind of a, it's kind of a
fascination. But this the day that I can point a chat GPT at
my little cast and have it automatically train itself and
get 90% accuracy on when to participate in my chat and about
answering questions on my behalf as an AI. That's the time when
I will become extremely interested in it. I will become
extremely interested in it because then it's saving me time.
That's what AI potentially could do. And you know, somebody
mentioned the teaching thing. I think there's another, I
understand chat GPT is a subset of instructional GPT. Did you
guys read about that? So there's another GPT. It's like, I
think it's called instruction GPT. It's actually designed for
for training and teaching and stuff like that more than just
a random chat one, the random chat ones to get, you know,
people's interest and stuff. So that actually does, does is
interesting to me. I think teaching is fine. I think that
they're, yeah, if there was some way to have a correct. So
that's that's kind of I mean, the thing of it must be really
cool is if you had a bot that was running, right? So if you had
a bot that was running, it was trained off of your corpus and
Zettlecast and it could chime in every once in a while. And and
it maybe it would get things wrong. It would say, well,
that's not the really the right answer there. Here's the right
answer. And then it could take its correction, add it to its
algorithm and say, so that whole thing that you have to do with
with AI, where you have to constantly correct it when it
gets stuff wrong, right? But it learns. Every time it gets
something wrong in a chat, we could laugh about it, and I could
correct it, and then it would get that answer right at next
time. And then, and then we could just keep going like that,
you know what I mean? And it could, it could try really hard
and I could just kind of train it, along with everybody else
while I'm while I'm not here. So the idea of setting up like a
schizix, that's what I used to name my bot, an interactive
bot that that that dynamically learns by attempting to answer
popular frequent and ask questions and getting them wrong
and having be corrected. That's like crazy, crazy compelling
for me. And that's just from a customer service perspective,
but from an educational perspective and all that. Now,
if you're going to start asking my bot about everything and
putting that in your essay, I don't know how I feel about that.
I maybe it's just making searching efficient. I mean, I
say that all the time, I say, if you want to be in good in tech,
you got to be a really good researcher be able to search
fast. Well, if you have a bot that's doing all the searching
for you all the time, and you're just asking your bot about
that's more likely to get the right answer, then, you know, as
it takes four gigabytes of RAM to train these these modern
models, really? Yeah, well, there's a lot of them. Yeah. Yeah,
I don't know. I mean, it'd be interesting to see how much I
could, I could do. I mean, I do have my thing over here. So I'm
trying to figure out how much I could actually do that. I'd have
to have a lot of data to write. So
Oh, no. No, that would not be a thing to get. Yes. So so that's
that's my opinion on it. Yeah, I'm kind of underwhelmed with it.
But I know that it's going in the right direction. I guess I'm
kind of annoyed because everybody's asking me about it.
And I'm like, Well, what are you using it for? And every time
every time I ask what they're using it for. It's well, it's
making me do my homework faster. I'm like, Oh, my God.
It's like, but I don't know if that's bad. I think it's bad.
I think it's bad because people are not doing their own
research. It's one of two things. They're either not doing
their own research, or it's facilitating their research. Right?
If it's the second, then I'm all for that. I mean, the terminal
makes you faster at doing your own research. So why not an AI?
So, you know, if you shut learning, yeah. So I think that's
it. I mean, I don't have any, I don't have any inclination to
play with it. I got too many other things to make right now.
But if, but if, as I said, if it were going to make my, my
Twitch bot more intelligent, so it could help people learn more
quickly and save me some time, then that's a good thing. That's
a good thing. So I'll try to keep my, my thoughts open on that.
But Project Matters and CCs are on board. It will replace jobs.
Then I'm fine with it. Use it as an education. They can't have
it. Just want it. Why would they, why would they have it
replace jobs? I don't understand that statement at all.
I've heard that before. This, there's, this chat bot is no
word near replacing anyone. I mean, I mean, even, even the
people who operated the front desk at like the place that took
my piss for my drug test. Even they are not, you know,
replaceable yet by this. I mean, I just, I don't see it being
that reliable. And I mean, and they were pretty damn bad.
They, I don't even want to talk about it. Oh, I'm sorry.
As you're here at 3.58, I did not want to, at 12.58 and not
one o'clock, you need to wait until one o'clock. Really? I
just don't even want to. It's a different thing completely. I
just, I just had to go through, like I had to wait in line for
like two hours to get a drug test. My phone died. I had to
come back the next day and wait again for two hours. See, any
of those things that could be improved by AI, I'm down. I'm
down. I'm down with those things being approved. Corporations
are going to use it eventually than people should use it as
well as benefit them. Yeah, for sure. Teachers are next.
At least the current way of teaching. Well, I think the
current way of teaching is totally broken. So I am all
about having, I am all about the education getting disrupted
by AI. And it's not completely untrue that the way that that
education is happening now could be taken over by an AI.
Absolutely. Absolutely. It's like, okay, I'm going to tell you
about a topic in general. And I'm going to sit here and blah,
blah, blah, and you're going to take notes and there's no
ability for us to interact except for off hours. And then you
get like an hour possibly with the TA, you know, the entire
model for modern education is totally broken. It's totally
broken. And it could easily be replaced by AI. I completely
agree with that. But if, but if you take the true learning
model, the art of x thing that we talked about, then where
you're, you're failing faster, you're being organic, and you
have a one on one mentor who knows you personally, I think
we're a waste from that. I do think that AI could get there.
I think that AI could have a strong chance at learning about
you and learning about your interests and learning about
what you struggle with and learning. I think those things
for education could be really cool. I mean, think about that
that you could have an AI that becomes trained on your
regular failures. So like, like you maybe you're learning a
foreign language and you get, you know, imperative declension
wrong in Russian all the time. It's like the thing, you know,
it's constantly doing the assessments and everything that
you would did a teacher would be doing, and then never doing
anything just giving you an F, right? It would be adapting and
saying, Hey, okay, I know you have trouble with this one
thing. So I'm going to give you more of these things. So the
potential to have AI adapt to our weaknesses as we're learning,
maybe we don't remember things very well, that would be me,
right? So it would be more about repetition. I think that
there's a tremendous potential there for that. I really do.
Intermediate with video graphics, not just text, so whole
learning path focus on the way of learning custom graphics
to explain. Yeah. Well, and that's another thing too. I
mean, there's there's a book out there called multiple
intelligences, and it talks about all the different ways that
we learn. Thomas, what's the name? Sir Ken. Sir Ken talks
about this is the woman who created the Juilliard Academy
failed. She failed out of all of her classes. And they took her
to a specialist and she was moving around. And the specialist
said to the parents, look at her. And she goes, What? He goes,
she has to be moving. They got her in a special school that was
sort that was dynamic for dynamic learners who were walking
around had to be moving to the learning. And she excelled, she
excelled so much she made the you know, the most she made
Juilliard Academy out of it. If they had written her off
because of her learning style. And that is one way that is one
way that AI can adapt. I mean, everybody knows a teacher, the
best teachers in the world are the ones who are able to adapt to
the individual peak students, right? And there's tons and tons
of horrible teachers who don't adapt at all. They stare, they
stay in their methods, they do their thing. It's like you adapt
to them or you die and get an F and you have to take it over
again and spend all the money. There's plenty of that. But but
you know, so the good teachers who who adapt and make things
engaging and and and change their methods or or allow God
forbid one student to do one project that's different than
another student because of the way that they learn. I mean, how
do you how do you set up, you know, a rubric for that? You
can't. But if you have an AI, maybe, you know what, maybe an AI
kind of thing is going to get us into this one closer to one on
one education, which is the holy grail. One on one education has
been the way humans have been learning best since the dawn of
time. There's overwhelming evidence of this. But nobody
accepts that evidence, because it's too impractical to do. At
least they say I don't think it is. I think they if they were
to actually economically, I think they can make it work, but
they don't. And in order to make it work, you'd have to have
mentors adapted to a different I mean, when you had back in the
old days, it was like one on one. And if that pairing didn't
work, you would find a different guru or a different master,
and you would go to that person, you would go to you would go to
one person for their mastery in this thing, and another person
in mastery in this thing that that's true education. And and
that's not happening in the traditional system. But AI could
potentially do it. AI could potentially do it. It could. Yeah,
there are reviews on game writers versus 10 years ago. Oh,
yeah. Yes. Yeah. Based on consensus. Well, I think I think
one of the things that individual instruction like that is
going to get both. This is something interesting about about
what I want to say here, homeschooling. So that's okay. So
I live in the South, right? I live in North Carolina. And
ironically, there's extreme agreement between very, very
right wing conservatives, and very, very leftist
progressives on this topic of homeschooling. Now, I don't know
if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but they agree that the
current system does not meet their needs. Now, the one people
agree, because they don't think mathematics and science are
priority, and that, you know, faith in Jesus is all that
matters. I was told that to my face when my son was denied
access to such a school, because he didn't have enough belief
in Jesus, according to their method, because we were Mormon.
That's a true story. And, and, but they had, you know, we
thought more, more direct instruction would be better,
but it turns out, no, they literally told us math and
sciences are secondary to faith in Jesus. And like, okay, we'll
be moving on now. And then you have the other people who are
all about the mass and the sciences and, you know, and
playing in mud and stuff like that in the kind of the hippie
education. And believe it or not. And so, so believe it or not,
those two camps, both want the same thing. They want the
government to get out of the way when it comes to education.
Because they believe that education can't be done properly
through any kind of, you know, singularly interested
association and all the problems that are coming up in
education are all related to this thing. I just don't know if
it's a good thing or bad thing to let people even get more in
their sandbox. I mean, I think, I think, I don't know. I don't
know. It's a really, really divisive topic.
Interested those South Carolina power stations have been
targeted this week. Oh, I know. I know. I was here. Dude, I
saw it. I don't want to talk about it right now. We can talk
about that at a different time. No, they confirmed it was an
act of terrorism in our state. So we're Ireland now. Yeah, I am
it's in my state. I'm seeing it on the news like all the time.
It's not even far away. Yeah, so we're Ireland America is
officially Ireland. We're getting we're getting we're
getting attacked by domestic terrorists. They're taking out
our power grid for two days. Yep. Let's talk about that
another time. I don't know if AI is going to help with that.
