Okay, start there we go. So we're now recording. It's we're in dark mode today
Mostly because it's a total disaster in my room right now, but as you can see there is a server taking form
It's coming alive
my server and I've actually got another playlist on YouTube called home lab in it
and
It will be
About how to set up your own home lab or how I set up my home lab
and I don't
Know how or when I'll be recording that but we're gonna come in so the first question
And is everybody still talking about so I'm gonna talk about it is
Did you buy all Raspberry Pi's in the world for your rig?
And you can't see it but like right up here on the top there's a 16 by cost me
$250 by the way. Yeah 250 dollars to get an aluminum Raspberry Pi
Hot swappable
to you
rack
Shelf and
Yeah, and I'm gonna be putting that there
But no, I didn't I actually have 30 or so Raspberry Pi's. I mean I keep finding them everywhere
I need to remind everybody I used to run a company
I founded a company called skill stack in 2013 where I was you know mentoring people in person at a school
I lived in a town home above it and the bottom floor was
Just lab in school. You can go to twitter.com slash skill stack SK
I'll
Sdk if you want to see pictures of it from from back in the day and maybe I need to show you that really quick because I
Want to
All right, so if to our studio audience who can't you're an audio only I'm going to twitter.com and
I am pulling up some
nostalgic photos from skill stack my
once popular
Place and this is where I have my curriculum and
There's like pictures and all sorts of things and if you go to actually if you go to Instagram
Yeah, you'll see some stuff
But the question is about Raspberry Pi and that's what I wanted to show you so actually Instagram is a little bit more fun
if you go to Instagram
com slash skill stack you'll see
Videos and stuff that I've done and including
So this is the there's my red rack behind me right behind my head
That used to be my really really really really cheap
I mean look at how ugly it is, but you gotta understand. I ran my own company. I kept my costs really low
And so I didn't have a proper rack. I do now because I work for a
Big-ass company and I make a really cushy salary. So I've been dropping, you know, like $300 on to you Raspberry Pi
Thanks, but this this is like a thing so all these little green lights out the bottom by the way
Or I have 19 Mac minis that are installed
Which make really really great?
Cloud home lab kind of things. This is me organizing
That was when I had to move skill stack into my apartment to my house that I rented for two years
And then we moved here and so now as you know the ongoing saga. We're gonna be moving within a year
To some other location. We don't even know where
To do my wife's MFA and we'll take a Raspberry Pi's with this, but no we did not buy all the Raspberry Pi's
But this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. Oh, this is a great. This was a game camp
This was this guy this guy made his own like
amazing thing
We don't know where we're going so this is the game camp. This was a summer camp that we had
And that was my workstation at the time
Uh, but I'm just showing you this we had light saver camp
It kind of stuck god damn these kids are so young all these kids are in college now
They're all in college now. Oh, I just found the box with lightsabers
Yeah, I found the box of lightsabers
um
This guy like distro hopped like 10 times in like a week amazing student
um, anyway, so
Oh, we don't know. I don't think it's going to be Wyoming. You know, I don't know where
So, but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. So everybody's wondering where they came from. I know I'm not buying them up
Uh, they're leftovers. In fact, so were them people like why do you have all this apple?
There you go. This is what I wanted to show you
This is raspberry pi camp
Check that out. Check that crap out
He wrote that from scratch. He did it all himself the entire requirements. Look at this one, man
The requirements for this raspberry pi in case you can't see it the requirements for this raspberry pi class
was just to like
Make one of the things blink
And he just he just kind of kept experimenting and putting wires everywhere and trying everything out
And he did making his own full-blown like microcontroller extension
Uh, and I was like, oh my gosh, this is what happens by the way when you give
people
Freedom to be creative in their learning
Yeah, and so that's where the Raspberry Pi's came from. So I have about 30 of them
I have a sort of robot. This is the old this is the old apartment where I used to live
Uh, well before I got kicked out of that
You give him the freedom and though that okay, here's another here's John. This is this was a
This was us getting hacked
We we put a a cloud server up
We put up a cloud server. This is security camp and we put a cloud server up and this is
The cloud server got hacked within a day during the camp during the week on camp. We said how long will it take somebody to hack us
Right and we were learning like
all of these different commands
and
His cloud server got hacked his his honeypot got hacked within a day
And and we were sitting there watching all the stuff it was doing and we were doing s trace
This is s trace
This is s trace on the the process that had hacked us
And so we could like see what the with the malware was doing and track it down and stuff really really fun
Um, anyway good times
No, he got we wanted to get hacked the people who got hacked first
There was like phishing like we were phishing. So if you got hacked first, you're one of the lucky ones
That means you got a bite
So he he got a bot he got a bite on the first day
And somebody hacked his closet. The whole point was to show how quickly
I'm protected. Did you see that royal typewriter right there by the way?
Yeah, that royal typewriter is was part of ah, I just spilled my coffee on myself
That's why I have a towel right here to protect myself from this kind of like mishap
Because i'm an idiot and it's also really dark. My coffee cup is brown
I think I might have to add more vodka to it. I'm sure that was not a contributing factor
Are we still having fun master shells matt you want in okay here you come
You're gonna give me crap. I know but i'm used to it
All right, wait, wait, wait, give me a second
Hey, Rob. Hi, how are you doing? Um, audio is a little bit messed up. Let me fix the audio here my audio
Problem with my device that I'll talk about another day
Anyway, so yeah, we did a lot of stuff there, but that's where the Raspberry Pi came from and I promise you
Uh, this whole open source contributed some coffee to this all no, thank god my map my laptop's closed
Yeah, so it wasn't it was only half full
The glass or half empty whichever way you want to look at it
Hmm, and there's my old IP numbers. Anyway, uh, do I consider myself under
Do I need to add that to the list so I have to answer that right now
I mean, I'm gonna add it to the list. Let's do that. I'll add that one right now. I'll answer that for you right now. Yes
Yes, I do
Anybody seen triumph of the nerds
If you haven't seen triumph of the nerds, then you don't understand what a compliment it is to call me a nerd
So go watch it
seriously
Seriously, if you have not watched triumph of the nerds
You need to
All right triumph of the nerds
Uh videos, I think it's out there for free. There it is
Excuse me 1996 documentary triumph of the nerds. It's like a three-part documentary
that goes through the creation of nerddom and
If you if you really want to understand the origin of personal computing and the internet there was a
Triumph of the nerds two they or no it was like two point
2.1, I think
And that was how the internet got made
and uh
I think it's bob cringely is the guy who did it the same guy who famously did the interview with steve jobs
Which they found old footage of which resurfaced near the end there there's 2.0
if if you want to get a real solid handle on
technology history
The most significant you can read the innovators, which is like a you know, 300 400 page book
Or you can go watch triumph of the nerd. So if you haven't seen it cue it up. It's amazing. It's really fun
Uh, it's it's it's from a different time
Uh, interestingly enough the guy who did this the guy who did this actually lived in steve jobs neighborhood
He worked for apple computer when it was in a garage
Uh, and then and then it became so much more. So, uh, I'll just tell you about that. So absolutely. I'm a nerd
But the real question is are you a nerd or a geek?
And if you haven't seen that nerd or a geek, uh back when you could actually watch
Uh
When you could watch uh retin link retin link have completely sold out. They're just grifters now
I used to really love retin link. This was eight years ago
But if you haven't seen the epic rap battle of nerd versus geek, which I geek which I cannot show here because we're doing
You know a thing on youtube
Make sure you watch it
If you don't know the difference between a need and a gert egg. Did I say a neek?
A geek is like we we I'm not going to tell you what they are
You need to watch retin link have this nice fight. It's really it's a really great rap battle. I think you'll really enjoy it
Uh, so they are definitely different
uh
but
Like play it like 10 times and slow it down and like listen to what they say
Because it it pretty much perfectly captures the differences between a geek and an earth
So that's that what this is the next question
Uh, what's your favorite tech art anything related to ghost logo?
I really really really do like ghost logo
uh
those of you who know rené rené french
uh
and is is uh rob pike's wife
and
The gopher is was designed by rené french
Uh, who has done many other things as well
And you can go you can go look at them
Uh and and see about them
Uh, we can look at some of the different images here
So here's all the thing I really like
I mean is is in fact rené french having been involved with artists a lot gone to a lot of art galleries
You can watch it in my rl streams on twitch
Some of which have been saved. I have I spilled coffee on myself as well. Oh well
um
my wife
My rené french actually reminds me of my wife a little bit. She's got that whole art look going on
and
uh, she's like really talented
and
you know she's um
Is she wearing rob pikes glasses there that looks like
It looks like she's wearing rob pikes glasses right there
That's her favorite glasses is she would
It's like they're wearing the same glasses or something rob pike would usually wear glasses like that
So rob pike made go lang uh one of the
Primary contributors to go lang is made this this is like one of the very firsts going thing. I absolutely
love love love, uh the artwork behind go lang is probably one of my favorite
um
The I mean as opposed to for example like the logo for java, which
You know was never any good
Where's the little guy? There he is
Duke the duke logo, you know, I'm just not impressed. I was fine. It was okay. It was the 1990s
um
In terms of art and tech, I do think they go well together
Uh, I actually made the logo for tumble
I made it
I created it. I committed it. This is my logo
It's your story you can actually go look at the commit if you go look at the commit on the github you'll see that I made it
Uh, it was actually a joke
It was kind of a joke. I made a poll request
Uh, I made it seriously. I made her poll request
You want to see it? You want it? This is my like my one of my few claims to fame
I had to put it in a question form in my stats of the ways
uh
Yeah, um
Uh, did you make the tumble logo?
And the answer is yes, I did. It's a very small claim to fame
But if you go to github.com slash tumble
I also got tom to kind of like pick up the pace
I was kind of on him because I was making a thing called file system as a database
Which I still want to do with yaml this time
and
Uh, I actually made tumble tumble spec
Uh to oopsie to try to give people to to look it up again
It's not there anymore. Damn it. I wonder if it's on github at all
It's a long time ago
This is it's interesting because I had no idea about anything on rust and I actually burnt sushi for example one of the
The the the moderator and also one of the primary contributors to a lot of the toml parsing
He wrote burnt sushi made one of the parent uh when they want to made the toml parser that's really popular for us
He also resigned very very publicly and famously
Uh from the rust project over quote and I quote you can go read the pr
Uh hypocrisy among the rust leadership
You can go read it if you want to read the whole drama and so actually it's funny because I kind of
You know rub shoulders with him a little bit while I was doing some of the toml parsing actually helped tom paletier
Do some of the that the toml parser wrote some of the test code for tom for for
There's been sushi for sushi's toml and again back then
I was thinking that toml was the one true way to create a file system as a database where you just have a directory
And you put a toml file in there
Recursively and you end up with kind of a flat file database that's structured
I still want to do something with that with yaml cherry and I uh remeer
Remedis I forget her his or her name their name
In the chat we were talking about that the other day
um
And something I'd still like to go but paletier is paletier paletier is actually tom paletier is like one of the coolest people
I have ever worked with in open source
uh
and
because
Tom actually it's like you know what I've always wanted to write a parser
I'm gonna write one and I'm gonna write it for toml and I think it's I think it's better than verb sushi's but whatever
um
And so I actually evaluated it and this actually got me into writing my own parsers
So there's a lot of parsers out there. There's a lot of people who like obsess about this kind of stuff
So you can go out there and work with them. I do have some commits on here somewhere
Maybe my contributions are not that big big enough to cite. I mean, I actually made a separate
Uh thing for the test code. So it might be a separate repo that I did and I can't remember where it is
Anyway, but yeah, let me show you that actual official commit to them
Uh to the toml project
Uh toml lang toml
Yeah, there it is
There it is there's my one commit to the toml project
And you can actually find it if you try to go I can't even remember where
Uh blob t logo
I mean, how how do I put this I go through issues or code for requests? I'm just showing off at this point
What kind of show is this?
But I'm super proud of it. So there
So let's go search for logo
Uh
Alt toml logo change log
Toml has a logo. There we go
Uh, what what change was that? What is this one?
Oh, that wasn't me. No, where is it toml has a logo? Oh, they put it in the change log
Yeah, tom tom approved my pull request that that was the that was the thing I wanted to show you actually approved my
My pull request I was like super happy tom made github by the way like made it
He also made gravator
So he's a big deal over in silica valley. He's also does his own thing these days
Uh, you can read all of his there's some recent drama with somebody who worked with him on on twitter
But whatever
And read with j.s. Yeah, he's made a lot of stuff. He's he's he's great
um
and you know
See all results I get
No, where's my logo commit? I'm gonna have to I want to find it. I hope they didn't delete it. That was like
That was like my
My one small thing
I don't even think I'm gonna register as a contributor because I was like my only contribution to the whole project ever and it was kind of a joke
Seriously, it was a joke. I was like here. Okay. I'm gonna I have to find it because it's a fun joke
Is it logos?
Yeah, is it? All right. Let me go find it
I don't know if that's gonna you know, damn it. Of course I have to do like main or whatever
Uh
I help me help me Obi-Wan Kenobi logos. Okay. This is yeah
sync get attributes for tom all
Tom on png six years ago
What?
Uh history let's go look at the history added logos. Yay me
I'm in a contribution
And
Seriously, you know the feeling the first time you get one of your I don't care how I stick
I mean, you know, chris nova is committing to the Linux kernel and I'm like making logos for tom all
Same things. I mean in terms of like sick, you know happiness
You know, so I like yeah, I did this added logo files
Seriously, it was like it was like 1 a.m
Some night and I was like, you know what?
Obviously everything is like everything is just a square bracket
So let's just do this and then the pr is something. Where's the pr history?
Where is it actually say the does it actually say it? Where's the pr?
I don't I don't know get as well as I should I kind of do but not as well as I should
I'm trying to look for the commit history
Because it said it said
You know, I won't care if you don't commit it. It's just kind of fun
Yeah, I don't I don't see I guess my comment got squashed or something
I don't I don't I don't I don't see it anymore. Let me see. Where is it?
You know the feeling
Yeah
Yeah, well
So whatever, I mean, Mike, I did make a the pr wait protocol. Maybe it's in there
Maybe it's in here
It's closed. It's it's closed
It's closed, uh, our next rub
Damn
There's no record how far back to have to go
Can have equals lost though? I know I do feel lost
I mean, how far back to have to go? Can I can I can I do a search?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, logo
Oh
Oh
Oh there it is took a shot at logos yeah my feelings won't be hurt if rejected
figured what the hell that was so much fun I seriously it was like you know it
was late at night I'm like what the hell let's just try this so because I was
trying to get it to pick up steam I actually created tumble dash spec which
I think didn't get picked up I mean but anyway I really like it because now they
used it for everything it's like all over now you can go on the internet and
search for Tomo logos and I made it it's like my logo everywhere so they're
rust people every time Russ comes out and the rest people come out to me they're
like yelling me okay but but but I made the Tomo logo because you know Russ
uses Tomo I mean Ruskin the Rust contributors are like Bert Zushi in the
gang I mean they were like fundamental to the creation of Tomo and making sure
it became cool and all there's many other cooler logos than mine but it was
just a shot at it look oh my god it's even on Wikipedia my logo is on
Wikipedia I can't stop I just can't stop this is saying anything about the logo
who made the logo to verbose that's true that's why I don't use that he's my I
use the animal these days it doesn't say anything about the history of the logo I
should like make a Wikipedia edit where did the logo come from Rob was bored on
one random night I know I should like edit it and add it I should say I made
the Tomo logo so I mean it's a small thing but it's the small thing I should
I do it right right now I have to don't have the login or something where should
I put it where should I put it if I'm gonna do this shit I'm scared you're
scaring me I need to put like criticism it's like just criticism holy cow why
don't we have history and that's like the logo I'm kind of nervous because I
don't do Wikipedia ever example criticism see also external links edit I
used to I I set up a Wikipedia site for IBM when I was on my team there and now
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing so it's probably not the thing to do
during our Q&A session but I don't have to come back I'll have to come back and
edit I tell you what I'll put it I'll report a request to that to the
community if there's anybody in the community who actually knows how to do
Wikipedia edits and has an account and has done so like reliably go go go add
that I made the logo put that on my tombstone made the Tama logo when I die
my greatest accomplishment I don't even know something you know okay not now but
maybe maybe someday I do need however to bookmark this I put that in my little
cast then yeah set create just a reminder I
how do we get in this I don't remember how we got we got an art we got an art
that was it yeah I did I made all the skill stack art I made the van art
oops wrong thing and stuff so I actually love graphic design I don't spend
it nearly enough time doing it I made like the can logo and some stuff I
really really love graphic design I particularly grat you know like icons
and stuff like that that's something I really enjoyed doing I think it's a
drafter in me I used to do a lot of drafting and map making for Dungeons and
Dragons and stuff like that do we have any other Dungeons and Dragons fans out
there former players of Dungeons and Dragons or current because that really
got me into that type of art so so yeah I was gonna show you that the Instagram
of that I mean I'm still this is still a question oh here's my wife's plate page
so I am married to Nicholas I could say Nicholas to Doris Kappner who is in the
other room and insisted I have coffee with her today oh boy movies get off
that quick she is doing sculpture she's obsessed with sculpture lately but yeah
and so being married to her is kind of nice because she's not really interested
in digital art and I kind of am I kind of obsessed with I've built you're
talking about art right so I built a tech retreat I get to brag about this I
guess I in second life I built the entire thing this I made this logo from
scratch from scratch including the shading everything I was super proud of
it I made t-shirts with that logo on it I made a three-year edition of the thing
that like rotated over my head and blah blah blah I mean this was a long time so
I mean this was really a long time ago this is before my divorce etc we had
dance parties guy we had fun we had so much fun and there's actually images of
ed tech retreat so this that here this is the architect rendering of the thing
I eventually built in full anyway so there's like a flicker feed on this I
mean you were asking about logos and art and stuff so that's kind of what
triggered this there's no flicker feed for a tech retreat that's so sad I feel
bad I feel bad that all of our pictures are not there anymore I think there's
like a Twitter feed for that too ed tech retreat that was an amazing creative
endeavor I really really liked it oh we already hear is it Instagram maybe it's
Instagram is it Instagram Instagram might have more things okay remember I
don't think there was an Instagram back then we go we click we would click on
things and go to the different Amy I haven't seen her forever yeah all these
amazing people that were educators and I got into education through through this
Twitter actually I wanted to get into education I wanted to do more than just
you know work and couldn't find it but uh ed tech retreat mohacks this is my
avatar custom had all reggae goes design nice a jumbo show a jumbo show we
actually paid this guy $3200 to architect our island for us and then I
built it but yeah I mean and that but you were talking about art that's I think
that's where it came up I'm trying to I'm trying to find my images but I think
they're probably gone at this point it's been so long ago yeah nothing nothing
here nothing here man that's kind of crazy it's kind of crazy because there
was so much stuff on there we had like lots of content but it looks like it's
all gone now anyway a question what was the question question was what's your
favorite a favorite tech art anything related to goes look so I yeah I mean
that's that's my favorite and I worked for Nike for a while and we did we did
tech art there as well but nothing like that Tamil logo is the one it's my
silly one that I made then I did a lot of art in second life in the 3d
worlds all right so next question what is the cheapest
homelab server I can buy so I actually seeded this question and because I've
been getting this question a lot because I built a homelab server and I'm you
know putting all my old hardware on there but we found the HP Z640 and 600
series to be by far the most affordable after a day of research so I
actually bought this server and it's renewed this is a different one this is
not the same one this is only eight core but you can get them for all kinds you
can get them there's a 32 gigabyte memory that's a smaller one but yeah I
mean you can like stack them right so I actually have one let me see if I can
find it HP yeah here it is this is the actual one okay and yes it acts as my
location that's fine so this okay so let me I have to tell you something about
this okay so this price tag $2,252 $2,252 includes and this is something I
didn't notice at first it includes 2 by this is the part I missed when I was
looking at specification you see the 2 by it says 2 by Zeon 14 core processors
this system I have for $2,300 has 28 cores that can be doubled 28 dual cores
so so it has a total of 56 possible CPUs when you're allocating virtual
machines and it has 120 28 gigabytes which can be upgraded ECC memory and 512
gigabyte solid state drive for $2,300 and I defy you to find anything that's
cheaper than this so far it's been running really solidly I have it over
here running and I'll keep reporting on it but this by far is the cheapest I was
able to find online I don't have any recommendations for any crypto of any
kind I don't do that stuff but but in terms of like home lab and like
instantly being able to make your own Kubernetes clusters or putting if you're
going to do Proxmox just put it on here don't put it on anything above 14 nodes
or your cluster will collapse like mine did and we'll get to that so this is a
fantastic way to go if if you want to do that this is by far the cheapest thing
I've ever found and there's another question why do you prefer Linux as a
subsystem within Windows I prefer Linux as a subsystem within Windows because
and I've answered this lots and lots of times but I will just give you the short
answer because I stream game and use Windows at work because they don't
allow you to lose Linux on your desktop at work and 99% of the places you're
going to work you can't use Linux on your desktop so that's the main reason
but selfishly the main reason that I use Windows for streaming everything is
because the streaming tools and OBS are over the top better than anything on
Linux you can do it on Linux I did it for a year but it sucks and anybody who
tells you differently is lying to you they're told I can objectively rip down
any argument that says that Linux streaming is just as good as Windows
streaming it absolutely is not absolutely is not let's mention if you're
gonna do gaming right and I know Linux gaming has come a long way but it is
nowhere near Windows gaming not even close so I do Windows gaming and I
haven't had a hiccup I actually my Windows machine goes stays running these
days up to a month I don't have to reboot it for anything even if it has
system things it says hey you should probably reboot I'm like fine I'm gonna
wait and then so what I do is I run a virtual machine that's got a gigabyte
surround and two or three cores on site inside of my Windows machine and then I
SSH into it just like I would do if it were over there and in my new home lab
I'm going to start doing that even more in fact they have the same name I have
Anton is the names kind of a you know a nod to Silicon Valley and and I'm gonna
be SSHing into Anton which is now living over here and we'll be on a UPS and
can run 24-7 blah blah blah blah and then I don't have to depend on a VM for
anything but it but it's kind of a stage right so if you don't have that if you
don't have a server yet then you might want to consider a virtual machine
that's running a one-two server specifically way better than Red Hat
across the board for reasons I'll talk about in a bit and and and then I I just
use Windows for everything else and then my my work computer officially is a Mac
and I also have a Mac so this whole bigotry about what computer you use you
just need to get over it in my opinion because I mean Mac hardware is top of
the line and I mean and I actually might these Mac minis are rock solid I have
been running these Mac minis in my cluster for over three years and they are
silent they don't put out any heat they just are really really good hardware and
they have just really great design so they're fantastic for for running Linux
unfortunately Red Hat doesn't agree that Linux the Red Hat Linux should be run on
a Mac and so they decided to not support it which is one of the reasons that I
abandoned Red Hat and OpenShift and and I'm gonna actually talk about that now
so so in a nutshell I've been complaining about this a lot recently and I'm
just gonna go out and just gonna say it and by the way if you get a chance to
run Linux on your desktop like I did at IBM for 12 years go for it it's a really
great way I ran Fedora on my desktop because I supported Red Hat at IBM for
10 or 15 years and I wrote RPM packages to install software I know Red Hat
inside and out I owned stock in Red Hat in 2002 and sold it by the way after they
did the whole Fedora crap so let me tell you a story I know you like it when I
tell stories so I'm gonna tell you a story how much time do I have stories are
easier for me to make my point okay so way back when there was a company called
Red Hat all right so I think that Red Hat started when did they start anybody
know so Red Hat started when I want to say it was something like 99 98 former
headquarters and see opening American subsidy founded in 1993 wow really okay
that makes sense yeah because 93 94 that was when yeah no that's that sounds
about right that sounds about right because that was when 94 was the one I
got into Linux really good actually no god I was before that no they must have
been they must have it no they just weren't popular yet okay so here's the
story so you know travel in time with me back to the 1990s when Linux became a
thing a big thing in fact right before that Unix was a big thing everybody was
into indigo colored you know 80s colored workstations that were nice and
pretty and it was all about the workstation in fact that led to Steve
Jobs making next step which was a workstation it was all about workstations
all about 3d as when Pixar was created and we would move past the PC we move
past PCs you know the max and then IBM's and all that the people used to get
worked on and accounting stuff and all that and we kind of moved into this new
age of like workstations workstations were the cool thing these were these like
$10,000 systems that sat on your desktop for doing 3d modeling and and drafting
and you know whatever I mean like really amazing stuff right and that was also
the dawn of the worldwide web so we started to see these things doubling as
web servers and blah blah blah so you go back to that time and Unix was
proprietary there was a Unix provider called Solaris which was founded in
Stanford for free by the way according to the Stanford University policy which
says you can start up very interesting story if you want to see thank you for
the something if you want to see the full story of Solaris I cannot recommend
more it's very boring but recommend more Triumph of the Nerds 2.01 which goes
through the creation of the internet and it talks about Macabre you know the
what's his face who started Sun Microsystems and then you know he was I
mean it's it's there's a lot there to talk about either creation of Ethernet and
all that so anyway Solaris and Sun Microsystem who by the way if you have
to recognize the name later invented Java and then marketed it for $500,000
largest marketing budget of any language ever in history became a thing so it
wasn't Ellison that was Oracle yeah I was a completely different thing
happening it was very very proprietary no Larry Ellison made Oracle no I'm
thinking of McCaffey the guys started 3Com oh god let me get his name who
started he was part of that he was part of the original Palo Alto crew at
Xerox and then he's he forked off his own thing and it's it's like escaping me
Robert Metcalf that's it it's not McCaffey that's this that's this software
guy that's the security guy it's Metcalfe Robert Metcalfe in 1979 so okay
so anyway in this atmosphere of like you know we need to the AT&T Unix was
$3,000 a seat and so there was lots of stuff coming up Berkeley made BSD
Berkeley you know that at Berkeley they made it there was lots of people
experimenting Torvalds across the the world was experimenting with making a
replacement for Minix which was was college professor's kernel and that
then he came up with Linux but they didn't have any way to talk to anybody
else because there was no internet yet yeah I think the stream dropped but it
could be my internet oh I hope I hope not please confirm for anybody else that
the stream is dropped I still see I see a red bit rate says you went offline but
I'm not offline it says I'm still streaming but now you're back to zero
viewers yeah what's up with that it dropped 30 seconds it's back that is
really weird and is it back I mean now it's back now it is back now okay well
thankfully that'll still be in the YouTube I'm mostly just be talking but
thank you it dropped for me yeah I don't know what dropped I can't begin to
guess maybe it's my server I don't know we'll see probably not put everybody back
okay so so anyway let me finish the story so at the time you know people were
thinking about different versions of Unix and everything and so there was slack
where there were lots of options and one of the biggest ones early on the
alternative the Unix was Solaris which is proprietary but it was still kind of
freeform and everybody loved it because they had a better attitude and but they
were still proprietary and at the same time Linux kind of became a thing because
it's like no we really want something that's free and it was actually the
guy who taught me about Unix who I said man I wish I had this at home and he
turned he goes well you can always run Linux and so I started running Linux at
home and and at the time there weren't that many options and I had a power PC
Mac because I was doing web design and thing and so I I ended up doing mock
Linux later I would get a P2 opinion and I would end up running Slackware for a
while and then I would try Mandrake Linux which is Susie and eventually I
would use Red Hat and Red Hat came out when Red Hat came out on the scene it
was a big deal Red Hat was a huge deal and it was probably the most
important free distribution on the planet now fast they promised you know
that they were going to support everything and and everything in it and
that was really great everybody was really behind it and then 2002 or
something came around and they decided to make Fedora and they said look we're
going to make Red Hat proprietary in other words we're going to sell it for
the end to the enterprise and we're not going to release Red Hat for use by the
community but we're going to make this thing called Fedora so people can
volunteer their time and effort and build up Fedora and we can steal all of
their innovation put it into our product and sell it because that's what they
did and at the time there was a major major like
backlash against Red Hat I mean it was a serious backlash anybody that's that
old might remember it but they were a disaster I mean they were a disaster of
a company making horrible decisions moving into I mean not horrible
decisions maybe decisions that were in their best interests that we're going
to make them a lot of money which it did and they became the standard
distribution for enterprise and everybody else was like man we want to do
that too so that was pretty much the first open core company that's a term
coined by GitLab which means their product is open source but they make
money on it on the side by all their proprietary add-ons and if you really
want to get into this go watch Stallman talk about all the little
proprietary crap that they inject into Linux in order to stick their hooks into
enterprise and make them pay big subscription rates and stuff so and
that you might be fine with that you know you might be fine with that but
that is not the Linux way it is not the FOS and open source way and there was a
massive backlash against it but nobody cared because Red Hat was making gobs and
gobs of money because it was bringing Linux into the enterprise and to this
day Red Hat is still so deeply deeply embedded in the enterprise that IBM
bought them for 30 something billion and now consider changing their name for a
moment apparently that's the rumor to Red Hat because it was so significant so
now IBM you know who brags every year about how many software patents it has
and keeps back engineers from becoming distinguished engineers unless they
don't get a patent who lied to me in the 1999 with the peace love and Linux
campaign or to get me in the door and then turns out it's all a bunch of
bullshit that company is the company that now owns and operates Red Hat and if
you think for a second that Red Hat is ever going to do anything in the best
interests of the overall Linux community you'd be mistaken as a company
individual engineers at Red Hat will there's many many individual engineers
and they support open source and they're doing amazing things what the most
controversial Linux commit that ever happened in my history is system D the
guy who invented it invented at Red Hat for the sake of enterprise because
enterprise had a specific need and they said that they had a specific need and
they made it and they pushed it in and they got it in all of enterprise and
now it's in a buntoon it's in everything else is highly controversial I'm
actually still okay with it slightly the guy that made it by the way guess where
he went he quit from Red Hat and he went he works for Microsoft now which if I if
you know anything about the history of Linux the idea that the lead engineer
the person who got death threats for creating system D is now working for
Microsoft I mean it's all I have to say about that and you just know what I'm
talking about now Microsoft ironically has moved forward and they are more pro
Linux than I think sometimes even Red Hat is I mean you know they're doing
they're still very proprietary but the point is is that all these companies
that said that in Balmer's words exactly that Linux is a viral operating
system in any company is crazy to install it are all like changing their
tune and saying oh Linux is awesome we're gonna do it do you think non non
system B distros are a big deal I don't know I don't know I I don't think you
can get away without system B reasonably there's no motivation behind it if you're
gonna do that you might as well just go BSD and there's a lot of software that
there's a lot of like you know routers and stuff that use it still so nobody
knows what system D is system D replace it replace the init system that was
kind of and there's many advantages of it and disadvantages the advantages are
you have this monolithic startup system that's not really unixy but it has you
know state so it can keep track of things better it can be more secure and but
it you know at the cost of being this big monolith that has to be deployed it
has all control to the whole system it's a very very controversial thing that
controversy has largely passed though and it's now the standard in all
enterprise Linux distros so but BSD Unix which is still the primary distro
used in router software and stuff like that does not use it and it still uses
the traditional init system so you have to go do your own research on that I I
don't really don't have an opinion on that I do think that we kind of have to
make some you know concessions I mean canonical and shuttle were taught us
that that the Linux world has to make concessions with the enterprise
community if we're gonna move Linux forward so it's kind of a delicate
dance you have to you know make in order to to walk that middle line but red hat
is clearly not and this is this is the tipping point for me okay and I know the
question was about OpenShift and I'll get to that but the question the the
question is about you know red hat and OpenShift so this weekend and I wrote
about this if you want to go read about it this weekend I I installed red hat
on my Mac mini okay and I was like okay I installed Rocky Linux and which is you
know red hat and I went through all the problems it's got a horrible graphic
installer I mean it's disastrously bad compared to a bunch of server and what
server install is so stinking slick I just don't have words for how good it is
and I have been using that my whole life I mean recently and so then I go so then
I try to do red hat and red hat just falls on its face it can't do certain
things it doesn't have this other thing it doesn't have this other thing and no
I installed Rocky Linux not Red Hat Enterprise Linux so they have a
different installer if they have it if there's a different installer with then
I will have to eat my hat and go do red hat Enterprise Linux installer instead
of Rocky Linux installer either way the issue that I hit after that still applies
so we hit an issue and I actually wrote about this in my Zettlecast and you go
read it where I found a forum on red hat that said do all of these things if you
want to get your Mac mini to work with red hat with red hat networking stuff and
it was you know totally doable it was just quite a bit of stuff and I have like
19 of these things that I have to set up and I was gonna have to go through all
these individual steps for all of them and you know red hat tries to have a
smart install but it really sucks compared to cloud in it and stuff like it
in canonical and you know in Ubuntu it's not even the same in fact Ubuntu could
be cited as the standard for cloud-based you know operating system
initialization cloud and it is by far the industry standard for that and so
anyway so red has got this other answer and in the forum thread somebody says
well this is on a Mac and then the the person officially representing red hat
basically threw him under the bus and said oh well that's Mac hardware we
don't we don't ever test on anything on Mac and the reason that that offends a
guy like me who was alive and owned red hat stock in 2000 2001 and eventually
sold it when they did the whole Fedora thing is because back then red hat
promised the world that they were just as much a member of the overall Linux
community as everybody else that they were gonna maintain that love and
support for Linux on all hardware you know and that we were gonna continue with
the mission of empowering old hardware with new Linux distro installations
and and recycling you know old computers which is all I mean that this is the
core values of Linux if you're in the Linux community those are our core
values that we we have choice we get to say what we want to do we can we can
make it so that it runs on any hardware and to be fair red hat still does run
it just takes all this extra work and so for red hat official people to say we
really don't care about you if you're running on Mac is basically just them
confirming what everybody has known all along would end up happening in 2022 the
only thing they care about is enterprise period it's in the name red hat
enterprise Linux there's no such thing as anything but enterprise them because
people don't run Mac minis in the enterprise that would be silly there's
actually a lot of people who do they're fantastic home lab machines by the way
they're much more powerful than a raspberry pi they have better hardware
and they're cheaper than a lot of mainframe you know other big systems
and if you're not going to do virtualization and you want to actual
hardware instance they're actually pretty good for that so you know as long
as they have Intel chips in them and they have one thing is a whole different
question we don't even go there so but you know that there's no plan for them
to support it but but that the arrogance of them to just say oh we don't care
about Mac people that just really upset me and frankly you know if I have an
enterprise CTO I'm not going to care about that either like no I'm really
happy that you're spending all of your money and time and energy supporting my
hardware why would you even dream of wasting your energy you know making sure
to test your distribution on any Mac hardware at all that's a waste of your
time and if I'm an enterprise CTO I agree with that but I'm not an enterprise
CTO I'm a guy running a home lab and I'm I'm I'm taking all of the hardware that
I have and there is a company that has values that are consistent with that and
that's canonical you can you can throw them under the bus all you want but the
name Ubuntu means what does it mean what does Ubuntu mean and finally we're in
short Ubuntu has few meanings when used as a as a Naguni Ubuntu term Ubuntu
means humanity however it is sometimes translated as I am because we are so the
diagram of Ubuntu is you know the logo is like all these arms arm and arm and
you know canonical has done some weird things they are a company as well but
the company values have never changed I mean they're just as relevant in the
enterprise microcades and all the stuff that they're doing and they're doing
you know I really really amazing things and so they're you know I haven't
seen about Red Hat Red has become the Apple of Linux Red Hat really has become
the Apple of Linux they they want to say that they're doing free stuff they
really don't care they're just catering to the enterprise and they just need to
come clean and own it and then everybody else can make that decision if you want
to be relevant in the enterprise but I tell you what there's a lot of
enterprises that are picking they're avoiding Red Hat and so the reason and
I actually don't like OpenShift for all the same reasons Red Hat and OpenShift
have done everything in their power to lock you in to their product and so no
it's not like 10 to no we don't know so the so the problem the problem we have
is that we have an enterprise operating like an enterprise with all of its
priorities which are to lock you in and create systems that you depend on
completely and they've very openly but they've been very open about doing that
and they they're trying to do that and for I don't want that I don't want that
a bottom line I want open standards and Red Hat can tell you all they want about
open standards but as long as they control the standard and and they have
been doing that I mean and they've done some good things I mean build that was
great it took Red Hat to kind of go at it proprietary wise with Docker Docker was
also one of these companies I want to lock you in they just proved it by
forcing everybody to pay for their enterprise product Docker desktop so
they've always been a company they haven't really given a crap about free
and open source software at all at the end of the day they're a company and
they need to make money and there's people there's people in the company who
like to believe that they have the needs of the open source community at heart
but then when they force everybody who's already got desktop Linux on their
enterprise systems to pay money because it's a big you know behemoth
enterprises got the money then you see with their true colors show and they
there's nothing wrong with them making money they're actually legally bound to
make money that's part of what being an S corp or a C corp is but they just need
to own that they are no longer free and open source they really don't care they
care about making money and so I know I'm going kind of off the off the edge
here but people know that I've been kind of in the middle of the road when it
comes to like corporate enterprisey conservative kind of you know you know
values and ethos and you know really really off the deep end FSF kind of
like if you're not using GPLV3 you're the devil and should be cancelled you
know and I'm kind of in the middle there but this whole experience with my lab
has kind of shifted me back towards the FSF side not quite I'm more like
Torvald Torvald is kind of dead center in the middle of it you know he
understands the needs of corporations and thinks you GPLV3 is the devil and I
agree but but you know he would not go so far as to say everybody should put
red hat on all their computers you know he stays out of that fight completely
mostly by focusing on the kernel architectures and stuff so that's a
pretty long rant but I I feel like I owe it to everybody let's see if we can
change the tone up a little bit though the open nature of Linux and
proliferation of distros saves us a lot I agree and you know and and somebody
let me show you another symptom of this okay so somebody said to me today
lbg I think it was you know who's fond of reminding me of stuff that I forget
which is always good they said well we would be nowhere in the container space
if it weren't for red hat and and and lbg told me about this site github.com
containers do you see any indication on this site that this site is red hat the
company there's none you have to like dig there's no official statement that
this come that this website is from red hat why doesn't red hat put red hat in
their github container in their github name because they know that's what I
think I think it's because they know they know if they were to put github.com
slash red hat that nobody would open it and so yeah I have a look at next is
pretty cool so so no so they they went to github.com containers there is no way
for you to know and unless you and then search as soon as you start looking at
the technology list you're like realizing hmm podman oh build a scope yo what
the hell this is red hat right and then you start to realize and then you start
to look at the names here you get there's a guy with a red hat just happy
was awesome I mean look as I said the people at red hat are awesome the
company right so just said he's really awesome software engineer at red hat you
know and the rest of them they're not gonna tell you where they work you mean
you know who they were if you know you know names you can look at them so so
this this is a good this is a good example of red hat trying to hide the
fact that they're red hat because they don't want to be associated with all the
things red hat has become associated with and that includes throwing their
nose at anything that they don't like or any any of the other part of the Linux
distribution they the red hat is one of the worst Linux citizens they are the
apple of Linux they and as far as I'm concerned I don't want anything to do
with red hat ever again in terms of a distribution and as a company I will
use their their contributions because I have to I can't avoid them because I
don't you know I don't have a say they don't care what I say they you know so
build a pod man and they'll continue to make stuff that you know is used out
there and I still think that there's stuff that you just like Apple I use
Apple products right but I hate Apple I know it's hard not being a hypocrite I
mean how are you gonna get work done if you don't use it so it's like you know
it doesn't mean I have to like it right so anyway speaking of things I have come
to not like recently I know this is very ranty night today but I feel like I
mean I wasted a lot of time this weekend on stuff that I wish I hadn't and I
wish I had thought through a little bit better so OpenShift is as everybody
knows is Kubernetes is red hats variation on Kubernetes it has some very
good things in it it to be completely honest though the biggest difference
between Red Hat and Canonical is Red Hat over engineers everything and they're
brilliant the Red Hat engineers are brilliant and they over an engineer
shit and they don't make it usable it's one of their regular problems and
Canonical is really really good at simplifying and thinking about usability
but they sometimes lack the engineering expertise that Red Hat has and what
would be really great is if we could get the middle of that you know I just wish
that they had done that they had done that I wish and Canonical's got great
engineers don't get me wrong but but the reason that I want to promote
Canonical and Ubuntu is because their products have always been you I mean to
a fault I mean snap comes to mind right have always been like focused on
usability above everything else if they over it I I happen to think that
over engineering is a sign of a somebody you don't want to work with but
that's there's there are people there are people there are engineers in this
world and you know if you've been around for any amount of time there are
engineers in this world who think that the most over engineered complex
solution is the best one because only smart people understand it and I cannot
overstate how stupid that is and how that person those type of engineers
should be weeded out and fired immediately the IT is so complicated that
the most brilliant people are the ones you can take a highly complex system
and turn it into something that can be some simplicity lock-ins are depressing
my we have a comment here my actual and first job is pushing me towards
learning OpenShift on top of already existing I've been products of lock-ins
are pressing they are they're depressing and so look I had a choice in my
home lab and in my personal life to say look I I do not need or want to learn
Red Hat and I don't want to stay current I mean the argument for me to put it on
there was hey I'm gonna stay current I'll be able to get a good job I get my
R&C you know I'll be good to go if I want to be an infrastructure engineer
and if you if you want to be an infrastructure engineer today I'm very
sad to report that you cannot be one if you don't know Red Hat you have to know
it but there is a certain percentage of jobs out there that people are hiring
hiring either container-based or DevOps or cloud-native and there are some big
shops I imagine I haven't seen any that actually use a bunch of server and I
have a choice and my choice is to prepare for those jobs even if that job is
way way way harder for me to find and this goes for rusted go and I don't I
just to compare it I you know I had I once advised somebody who ended up
getting a job in inflex DB doing go programming it was a new rust I told him
point blank I said you know it you go for it go for it go I you guys won't
believe this about me but I actually encourage this guy to go find a rust
job I said look you you know it's gonna have to sacrifice you have to move to
Germany there's lots of like rust jobs in Germany but you know if that's your
real passion then you're gonna have to make a sacrifice and find a company that
has it and he came in one day on his own to me without me saying anything and he
says I'm starting to think that I should learn go so I can get the job and then I
can just have rust and do that on the side until it gets big and he got six
how we got the job that's exactly how we got the job because if all of inflex DB
isn't go and except for flux the flux language which is in rust they ended up
getting a job working on that the point is that you don't have to pick the
mainstream stuff ESXi I mean you know you don't have to pick those things I'm
gotten older so I my picks are largely in line and training you as largely in
line with what's going to get you an immediate job but sometimes especially
like right now you know you have the choice to say you know I don't need to
give in on that for example if I want to use Linux on the desktop if you want to
lose Linux on the desktop and you don't want to work anywhere that doesn't let
you do that you can filter out 80% of the companies out there and you can say
look I don't want to work for any company that is too stupid to not let me use
Linux on my desktop and I used to I used to joke with my old manager he's gone
now he left you retired but I used to joke with him after he hired me I was
like you know if I had asked that one question I would never have taken this
job because they forced me to use a Mac or Windows and I after being using
Linux on the desktop for 12 years and I adapted and I'm using VMware now and
everything but but seriously if you're interviewing you can choose and I guess
that's the point I'm making you can choose to say no and you can you there's
never been a time when you could be more picky especially if you're good you
can say look I I don't you know no you're gonna make me you're gonna make me
use Windows every day goodbye there's like you know 10 other people down the
street that will hire me I mean but you have to make your own decisions if you
want to make your chances for working in a place a lot of just some cloud for
you like they use it on the server of course and you know but but you can you
can do the same thing you can make a choice you can say I don't work want to
work for any company that uses Red Hat servers right you can do that that's a
very very very tiny list of companies that you'll work for and you'll be
eliminating most of the fortune 500 but you can do it you can do that you know
it's your choice you could you could say you know whatever so that you anyway
um that that's kind of that topic let me let me see if I can save some of these
I mean we do we were a little bit late so I'll try to bump bump through the
rest of these questions really quickly a desktop too yeah why did I bend a
proxmox so people have been watching me do my home lab and it stuff and
proxmox I did not know this when I got into it I really wish I had I wrote a
lot about it in my Zed if you want to read it the short answer is proxmox
maximum that maximum nodes in a cluster is 32 I got the 14 nodes in my cluster
and proxmox started falling on its face in ways that I won't go into detail on
it just could not the coral sink could not keep everything updated I had
caching problems because the icons were not getting refreshed properly and all
the problems I was having were confirmed by tons and tons of forum posts on
proxmox from the people having the same problem and everybody that I ask who
says proxmox works great for them it has like less than five nodes usually just
one node and and they use it so I mean I was already kind of leery of the whole
a ferro gpl v3 license of proxmox was released under and the whole use of
that you know dependency on a web interface I mean I did like it it was
super pretty but it's definitely not necessary and so after I hit those
problems I was like now proxmox is out of here and and then another another
problem too is that I noticed that all of my 4 gigabyte mac minis gave up 1.2
gigabytes of RAM just to running the proxmox agent that's true story
just to run the proxmox agent which which is I mean to run the base to base
you know virtual machine and then the proxmox agent on top of that took up 1.2
gigabytes of RAM so I had about three gigabytes of RAM left to do anything with
really anyway I haven't done a comparison with a bunch of server I went
ahead and put the full version of server instead of the minified version on my
nodes at this point and I went ahead and reinstalled and put that on 19 to put
things so I'm going to be running a bunch of server on everything and then I'm
going to be running KVM and live vert and vert manager from my main server
directly and then also the VNC and stuff like that from it I don't really need
anything to do that management if I'm looking at like Ansible to kind of help
with that but after looking at it how problematic Ansible is with the whole
Python thing I'm actually thinking about making my own single binary agent that's
compiled with bonsai that runs on the endpoints that does essentially what I
did when I was at IBM and I wrote I wrote an entire infrastructure framework
there for audit compliance of security for 52,000 machines and think about doing
the same sort of thing and go just as a fun project it's a home lab that's what
they're for and I absolutely hate all the solutions that are out there right now
because they require Python virtual environments and they they overstep in
what they do to the virtual machines and and if you still are running on iron and
you don't want to run in a VM because you're going to take a 30% loss through
containers that's another stat I found I switched to KVM verb box from virtual
virtual box. Did you really? Cool and I mean I really think KVM is the way to go
KVM is the basis for all major cloud providers now and it's gonna be the
future and so anything that I can do that plays in the KVM space is gonna be
more relevant long-term and it's also fun so I'm gonna be writing I'm looking at
Salt right now but that's also Python and I was like eh so I may be stealing
some of the best ideas of these configuration management systems and
creating one and go if one doesn't already exist and doing that. I might
actually resurrect Fluff which is was what I started some time ago to do this
very thing to provision you know VMs really quickly and based on profiles and
things like that but to do it on a local machine using you know your local
installation of VMware and I started with virtual box we had three providers
and they would do it locally if you had enough you know procs but I think we
could come back to the to the Fluff thing and maybe come up with some sort of
distributed thing as well and now we're like controlling things remotely as
well so if we do that that'll be a Bonsai branch it'll be Fluff as a Bonsai
branch and then we'll be able to put that in your monolith and your Bonsai is
your monolith whatever you want to do so that's that's all development that I
plan to do over you know when this weather gets colder and stuff and after
I get my lab set up so if you want to watch any of that happening it's going
to be going for a while yes it is a not invented here thing I'm making a
monthly what I really don't understand is why there's not a better product in
this space that's a single binary the closest thing to it is Terraform which
is just orchestration I mean you can bend it's arm and make it do configuration
management but it's not designed for that and there's no combination of
configuration orchestration and and stuff like fabric which just runs remote
you know just run this one thing remote and give you back the results and I
I don't know why and I feel like there's some area for innovation on that front
what's the font this is group this is Ubuntu mono yeah it just looks good
because I adopted the group box so and and I run it at a pretty high size so
that you can read it from wherever what is your font about that we under that
um so the question should you should you try to run Linux on max of Apple's
actually trying to keep it from happening the answer to this is yes in
your home lab so there's kind of two contexts for when you make a decision
about what you want to run Linux on if you're picking hardware for any
size organization obviously you're not going to buy max for that but if you are
working for a school or somebody that has a bunch of old lab hardware Mac minis
like mine or other old hardware and you don't have the budget to you know use
the cloud or even have a good internet connection for God's sakes there are
max servers yeah but yeah we were talking so yeah they're 10 and they were
on AIX do you remember the 90s and the 90s yeah the power PCs they run AIX
this IBM took so anyway yeah I can tell that people are not as interested I have
to say anymore that the viewers are dropping a little bit that's fine I
don't care so you should try to run Linux on max I I do think that if you have
an old Mac and you want to breathe life into it again because especially if it's
been written off by Apple who said we're not supporting that anymore
goodbye and and it has Intel hardware which is a lot of old Intel that's
then yeah hell yeah OSX server yeah the cheese grader Mac Pro and it has OSX
yes yeah it does well yeah I mean there yes the answer is yes I think you should
run Linux on anything and everything and I have made a great hobby and passion of
mine to do that there was a time when I couldn't drop five grand on a server I
make you know the sweet corporate money now but there was a time when I was
restarting out and there's a lot of you out there watching right now who don't
have that kind of money and you are you know at best in a in a dorm where you're
trying to get it to run and you're trying to dual boot your mid laptops and
stuff right and to someone like that just having a server of any kind having a
separate computer to run Linux on is and use it as a server and leave it plugged
into the wall it's a big deal and for many people they will find old hard
I had one guy who was the son of the director of tech for Davidson College and
he had like thousands of dollars and left over hardware made me so sick if you
just got so you know Linux Linux is I mean one part of the core ethos of Linux
is breathing new life into old hardware no matter what and you'd be surprised
when people can put Linux on it's amazing to be mean to viewers yeah I can't be
pretty mean so anyway so what I'm trying to say is that is that you should you
should try to run on anything and you don't let people put you down if you're
running it on like a p2 or you know some really ancient hardware because you know
what you'd be surprised this is nothing about Linux I never get tired of dealing
particularly when I was mentoring people directly one-on-one in person I don't
get this I don't get this buzz as much as I used to because I don't deal with
people and it's really annoying actually one of my I didn't get paid much when I
ran my own company because I lowered the range really low so I can do the bare
minimum and so one of the things that was valuable to me was being in person
with somebody when they're learning this stuff all of the aha moments oh oh I
used to be present when they would have these moments and they were worth like a
hundred dollars each to me they still are I miss it this is why I want to I want
y'all to stream so I can get you know paid through watching you discover stuff
because because seriously so one of those times there there is nothing better
that okay so one guy actually brought in is another story one guy brought in I
told him I said look if you look at you don't have a computer I don't know where
to go I said I promise you next time you're at a family gathering if you ask
your family members if anybody has an old computer in the closet or the attic
someplace that they're keeping because it's got old tax records on it right it's
got old tax records on it and they're too afraid to give it to Goodwill and I
guarantee you there's tons of them if you go find those things and they say well
we don't want to give it's got tax records I okay well or browser histories
or something like that right you could you can go find it you will find one I
promise you and you promise them that you will wipe that this clean and that you
will make it better and that you will put it to good use and I you would not
believe how many free computers people can find in fact it was such a thing it
was such a thing that we would actually start going through neighborhoods we
started putting together an affidavit that we could get legally signed and
present to people so we could say look we are officially this is our official
position on this we're not begging we are taking your old computers cleaning
them up and and rent it rent it you know renewing them and giving them the
people who don't have computers so that we can close the digital divide in our
own country that is my primary goal with Linux and if it if and if a company
like Red Hat says we don't care what our distro runs on do you see how
offensive that gets to me because that's like Red Hat saying we really don't
want to be a part of that and we just want to cater to the enterprise we
don't care about all the Linux efforts that are going on all over the world to
put computers and technology in the hands of people who don't have it to take
old hardware and breathe new life in it because the most pleasurable aha moment
that you will ever hear is somebody booting an old computer into Windows 98
and I kid you not looking it around at all the old Netscape navigator stuff on
everything and installing Linux and watching it just cook as a server
watching it run fine as a server watching it be 100% performant as a
server because it's way more powerful than the even a Raspberry Pi 4 even
though it's like 10 year old computer so instead of going to the trash heap or
to someplace else this computer becomes a new toy and it's now in the corner of
the garage or is plugged in it's like really slow ethernet you know and
there's that so to me that's when you when you ask whether you should run an
Apple I think you should run on anything and I think the first time that you show
somebody I mean look if you take away all that ugly gooey right you're using a
10 year old computer right now exactly you take away all that ugly gooey stuff
and you learn to use a terminal you would be blown away and you can run like
the fish at max settings you know and if you're using VI you're not going to get
any lag at all because it's VI VI's rate is supposed to work on 300 bond so you
know all of these things make using you know computers really fun again in fact
if there's one reason to try Linux is it makes computing fun again using Linux
makes computers fun to the right person not everybody wants to use a terminal
and see what they can do with all these important these kind of people by the
way are the kind of people that will like you know like get a pair of wire
cutters and strip down old serial cables and like cause them to control other
electronics and shit like that and maybe they never did it before but they just
want to experiment with that that's the kind of person that gets really into
this kind of stuff working with Linux and open stack all day oh you'll have to
talk to us about open stack I actually want to open sucks all Python
unfortunately but I am thinking about learning open stack because I think
open stack would be better than something like Proxmox for even a
home lab and by the way open stack there's lots and lots of work in open
stack yeah if you learn open stack that's something that's an open source
very very open source technology that is but apparently they they're really
really really bigoted about Python yeah tiny far reported that that he tried to
commit some some add some projects and go to the projects and they were denied
because they were go and when I heard that I was like oh I don't know man I
mean they're that into Python you know that they don't want to even consider
other languages so I they're we're kind of on the cusp of a lot of other stuff
hey how's it going South Korea love having you I love South Korea I cannot
wait to go one day I want to go to South Korea so better hurts Python it gets in
nature yes that's right yeah so who got all the pies I have a few what did I
change my title please tell me I did okay good I guess I guess I didn't I thought
I did I did that same thing I did before again I thought I changed the title I
didn't all right well let's let's wrap up the stream here Singapore fantastic
oh I'd love Rancher desktop rancher but it's got a problem um what is the data
like I have no idea what is a data like I am a nerd we talked about that already
yeah you go back up watch the watch the YouTube video when I post it if you
wanted a data lake is a centralized repository allows you to store all your
structure and structure data at scale because there are data as is having to
restructure the data yeah I'm not a I'm not a fan of data lakes I got it fair
I've been a relational database person in my life if you look at like MongoDB and
a bunch of people that have tried to do object databases and you see them fall
in their face and end up deploying a relational database later you'll see the
problem I think you should start with relation relational database up front if
you need a database if you don't need a database you might be fine which is files
actually I know that's heresy to say it but yeah I but I'm not I'm not a fan of
that so yeah corporate yes what do I think of web3 I hate it web3 is
disastrously poorly designed it's horribly over engineered by extremely
intelligent people who have no practical sense whatsoever and these are my worst
type of technologists if I detect that type of technologists in real life
whether I'm working with them or I see them at a conference or at a pub I will
do everything in my power to get out of the room and go somewhere far away from
them because yeah SQLite exactly so people who don't understand why web3 is
a bad idea are not thinking in practical terms I absolutely despise
engineers who are not practical who do things because they can who like to pick
technology because it's cool and because it's complex I despise technology for
technology sake yeah I'll go swing and a hammock I will this technology is
serves one purpose of one purpose only and that is to enable life to be better
and to go on and to you know create harmony in the universe and and all of
those things and any technology that just tracks from that especially if it's
claiming to do that and it fails to hypocritically I don't want nothing to do
it and that's web3 as web3 that's NFTs as any of the crypto stuff am I
opposed to people exploring the realm and see if it's a good way to secure
exchanges between banks and stuff possibly I just I'm just tired of
impractical people applying their extremely intelligent brains to things
and coming up with shit that makes no sense at all and by the way HTML was a
bad idea myself too I think HTML was a bad idea and to a lesser degree HTML was
exactly this problem markdown was plenty fine why didn't they use it
markdown was invented by writers who wanted something practical HTML was
invented by scientists so they immediately went to the other scientists
and they said hey scientists what are you already using for like managing like
data and stuff we're using this SMGML thing with some big-ass acronym that
doesn't make any sense to anybody and makes them sound really important no
markdown did not exist if it had in fact the knowledge exchange grid that I
want to make is markdown and Hugo's markdown right yeah Hugo's Hugo's a
go-tech so markdown is relatively you know by the way Aaron Schwartz and John
Gruber made markdown John Gruber still has I think John Gruber has been he's so
much of a writer and a podcaster he they asked him JGM who made pandog invited
him to be in a you know involved and he's like nah and so JGM's lost was like
trying to document mark if you go read the ITF RFC's on markdown it's hilarious
because there's no official markdown specification at all and so they tried to
come up with one and JGM was left this Berkeley guy was left to come up with you
know as close as he could come up with with a standard because markdown as
defined in the Pearl script that John made that Aaron helped him make by the
way Aaron Schwartz God knows he's one of my favorite humans who ever live you
know they it's got tons of bugs and consistent use of specification a
JGM very scientifically like philosophy professor Berkeley he's like okay we
got to fix this so he gets in there and he tries to fix it all and he comes up
with as much consensus as he can for common mark and he got GitHub to sit at
the table and read it and a couple other people and they come out with the
common mark standard which you know and get a flavor markdown as an extension of
it now and so that's all been standardized but you know so look there
does need to be a scientific approach to it but I tell you that story because
it's a perfect example of engineers screwing shit up they do it all the
time engineers fix problems but they also create problems out of thin air
because they're engineers and I know because I've done it I've done it I've
done it so many times raise your hand if you've done it raise your hand if you
overengineered a solution and you're like you come me go get some coffee you
come back and you're like and you look at it you're like you mean I could oh my
god or or here's a bit here's a better one here's a better one your wife right
you like you like you're like going for a walk and you don't have a twitch stream
to torment with all of your ideas right yeah and you're and you're talking to
your you're talking you're like tormenting your wife with like technical
knowledge right it's just trying really hard because she loves you to understand
what you're saying and she's trying to follow you because she loves you and you
try to follow her art stuff and everything and and I don't know where she
says well what if you did this I mean I mean she's like you know I'm not a tech
you or anything but what if I just what if you just did that instead you're like
oh my god you're a genius oh yeah you know it's like so oh you're gonna come in
and comment on that I'm just wrapping up just telling him how you have to have
somebody who asked why are you doing it that way
ooh beef uncured hot dogs mark wallberg is making hot dogs now okay okay turn
to laugh thank you walks on you talk about tech how many things that break
why does this why couldn't this just be simple why did I have to make my
documentation website use JavaScript IBM I posted on Twitter today seriously all
of all of IBM's documentation site requires JavaScript to read it ask
yourself how come that's a bad idea so so web3 to me I need to answer the
question what do you think of web3 I think web3 is the epitome it's like if
you took all the people if you took it like like the whole Rick and Morty
idea where you can separate the toxic cells from the good self you know if
you were to take all of the toxic over engineers self from every engineer and
you were to put that in a big vat of actual you know goo in Rick and Morty
style and you were like have it like take on some sort of like nebulous form
that could communicate it would create web3 because that's what it is web3 is
the absolute worst possible design from the most over engineered impractical
frankly idiotic perspective you could ever imagine and I this I'll have to
say about that it makes me really happy that at least have my feet on the
ground and that sometimes I'm actually happy that I'm dumb compared to some
of these other engineers because it causes me to think things through more I
can't you know spit out you know complexity through your algorithms or do
land to calculus you know at lunch I'm not that guy I can't do that so I'm
glad sometimes because it keeps my feet on the ground and it makes me think
through things and think and ask questions like why are all these dashes
in all of our command lines get off to get up isn't as in a good example of
over engineered crap when somebody created a user interface that was an
engineer is I will put one dash here for this will put two dashes here will
allow colon for this and that's why I made bonsai because I am a practical
person I don't like when people over engineer stuff and one of the most
over-engineered things ever is get up so the little rant about that no
experience with snort and NIPS or NIDS I wish I did I'm super sorry I can't
talk about that this is just the whole idea of looking at logs all the time
and studying those and combining them all that's been around since the days of
like centralized system log daemons but it's still a thing I still think it
should be done what is NIPS I don't know what NIPS is network and prison
detection system umbrella term for combination of hardware and software
that's cool I like the concept from what I understand of it is the system that
attempts to detect hacking activities to now have service attacks I think these
things are cool I really do I don't have anything I don't my is just old-school
tripwire we would just like checks on every file on the whole system make
lists of exceptions and then watch for things to change security is actually
a lot simpler than most people make it out to be kind of in that practical
sense all you really have to do to ensure a system is secure is track
everything on the system and tell you when anything changes you don't have to
have fancy signatures it can be gotten around by compiling the same malware and
go that was in C before you don't have to if you just look for things on the
system that are regularly changed and and to create ways to detect those
changes in the system and report on them that that is the number blue one blue
team approach that I think everybody should be doing and I don't know that's
how I caught the hacker who invaded my computer at home back when I set up my
own mail server and that's how everybody it should be doing it I don't
understand why it's so hot so hard the defender-defeater yeah what is held up
and I should use it so held up is a lightweight directory access protocol
this is something that came from the 90s that was used to put group information
for corporations and stuff and it is still used a lot it's used in we've
talked about it before we talked about it with I want to say Hayden and with
free IPA and some things like that it's built into Active Directory now as of
May as of May 2022 and it's the way that you get group permissions once a
person authenticates to see if they can do things if you can authorize them to
do different things I think everybody should use it it should be a part of
your system in your identity management and how you do things we will be putting
open LDAP on my lab here probably in the form of free IPA although I'm I'm a
little at the area free IPA now now that I've been looking back at NIS which is
really old-tech but I want to see if there's something related to that before
I make a decision right now I'm just doing localized logins on everything
and which is more zero trustee because it does use search for all that LDAP is
not a Windows thing no LDAP is getting if you do a search for LDAP you're going
to get a lot of hits for Azure and Active Directory these days because that's
usually where people are running or deploying it but it's actually way
older than that yeah on Linux it comes yeah Linux LDAP has Kerberos built into
it uh-huh Kerberos is the name of the three-headed dog Greek dog that was
guarding whatever and is MIT technology designed to do password
authentication without ever sending passwords over the over the wire by
exchanging data that's been signed using public key cryptography so Kerberos is
the standard even if you're not using it outright you're using it inside of
other things it's Kerberos is is built into PAM for example and Linux SE and
and LDAP and everything else it's just not always front and center yeah the
tickets that nobody really understands exactly if you're familiar with wire
shark yep it's another one yeah and you can watch LDAP over the wire to these
days LDAP is secured and you know over encrypted connections but not always but
most of the time these days LDAP is used to give information about an account
regarding you know what things it's authorized to do and what it can do
roles will say role-based authentication I mean authorization but it and it can
be used for authentication the first part that says I am me but that I am me
thing is now taking place elsewhere in Kerberos and other things that are and
then LDAP is provides the other data they get that right it's still useful not
over-engineered I think public key cryptography is not over-engineered at
all I think I think it's actually the only natural way to do it it's other
things you call smart or harmful no absolutely not no and that there are
some things that have to be complex cryptography is one of those things and
I you know and I accept that right I don't think cryptography can be although
I mean you can make the argument that some of the cryptographic algorithms
failed because of over-engineering if you I'm not going to get into it but if
you like short like the failure of blowfish or RSA or any of the other
ones that are no longer officially good you know you might you know uncover the
fact that somebody was getting really clever and their cleverness ended up
being their downfall but you know we do need cleverness don't get me wrong so I
yeah does does how to I mean my favorite XKCD about this is and you guys know the
XKCD about the password thing it's a perfect example of this over-engineering
concept that seems to be the theme today is anybody have a link to it I'll go
find it XKCD password it's one of the most popular password here it here it
is right wait oh true but our common substitutions your risk no that's not it
where is it that's not it
Enigma into coffee just enough to use it effectively yes it was dang it where's the
one you guys know what I'm talking about password password password actually
password encryption if you know it's the next KCD about the encryption thing I'm
trying to find it I can't it's taking me forever because I'm slow or is it you
just have to look for a club yes where is it I love it I love it I can't find I'm
gonna I'm gonna spend all day trying to find it if I can't find it you guys can
try to help me find it it's the one where he talks about his algorithm for
defeating defeat cryptography how to defeat password cryptography
ah it's actually it's actually a joke about it in and Mr. Robot oh here it is
yeah this is the one okay so here we go a crypto a crypto nerd's imagination his
laptops encrypted let's build a multi-million dollar cluster to crack it
no good it's 40 96 bit RSA encrypted blast our evil plan is foiled what
would actually happen his laptops encrypted drug him and hit him with a
$5 wrench until he tells us the password got it this this is my favorite
because this is exactly how this is engineers over here right and this is
like practical dumb people threat models are a thing they are a thing you know
and you know it's like you spend like a multi-billion dollars on the door and the
wall next to it is two by fours and drywall it's like but then they don't
think about it this is this is a pretty common meme out there by the way they're
not dumb right they're not so you see engineers I mean you know it's I think
that this problem comes about because people overthink the technology either
because it's exciting to them because they really get off on mathematics or
something or some other reason I don't know but they they don't accidentally
locked as you Q says accidentally locked my keys inside a calm closet today then I
realized the door was on backwards so I just some metal in there probably a
vulnerability absolutely that's what I'm trying to tell you yeah you know it's
fun it's it's fun to talk about it's horrible when I when you experience it
so as I seems to be kind of the theme today I hope I hope no one gets overly
bent out of shape on my picking on engineers I am one and I am the first
one to tell you that I've made tons and tons of mistakes because I overthought
something and some of these projects I threw away do you guys remember that
parser that I made where I made my own school sub language to do all the
parsing and I was like why don't I just let go I mean I totally threw the whole
thing away I threw like three weeks of work and an entire documented sublay
subgo API for this language that I had created and I chucked it all and I
replaced it with like a one-roon character scanner instead and and then
code did cogeneration when necessary and I was like oh my god what was I
thinking and you know we're gonna go through those times that's just human
progress but you know and I really shouldn't beat people up for over
engineering things until they get like all you know white towery you know ivory
tower about it's like you're gonna use what we give you and you're gonna like
it and people get like that I have lose my patience a lot of over engineering
actually comes from corporate and management from not from mentors
themselves I agree let me give you an example of that one fun one fun in the
crypto web three job you experienced it firsthand really so let me give you an
example of that the engineer the management screwing stuff up okay this
is a true story from my buddy Brent who worked in the military I taught him
Lennox you know back in the day he had taught me Solaris and he was kind of my
mentor I was the first official system of in job I had I had been doing what
development I was like his webmaster before that this is my first actual job
you know managing Solaris and AIX and everything and he told me a story once
that we used to play chess and and eat and talk stories because it's just a
min job at lunch and he told me the story once about how is and I've told the
officer before his senior officer he did all the work to speck out a Solaris
server and he got the best one possible for the job and it costs like 20 50
thousand it was like really spendy but it was small and if you know anything
about technology you know that if you want small you pay more money right and
so I mean it was barely the size of like a for you tower today right but we do
have questions but not right now we're about out of time we're out of time but
if you want to you can give me a question we can put in for tomorrow or you can
come on in and leave the questions in our discord in the questions of
conversations and advice channel economy of scale right so so I mean everybody in
the IT world knows that small is better you know if you can keep the heat down
everything so no joke his senior officer said I have my commanding officer is
coming in I'm giving the tour and that will not do they're gonna be here in two
weeks you need to do something about this news like what do you want me to do
and he's like I don't know it just needs to be bigger very male American
military thing to say and he said well we could get a rack for it and we could
get it like a we can get like a we can get like a rack for it like a like a 42
you rack for it put it in that he goes is that bigger and he's like well yeah I
mean that would be like you know 13 feet in the air and you just put the in
there and we just close the door on it and he's like I want that I want that
his senior officer no kidding his senior officer commanded him to spend an
extra $300 like a Dell rack or whatever to put his like four or five you server
in that costs like $20,000 $50,000 and you know he's like okay I'm sure it was
and you know we were just riffing he's like oh you know you can put some lights
on it yeah it's the kind of Atlas suspension I know but you know when he
got victorious like see this is our new computer which we just which we just
purchased you know and Brent's been here at Brent's been instrumental in getting
the server for us and Brent I just love Brent I wish I could get Brent on a
stream Brent is the most stoic human being I have ever known he's hilarious
he's so hilarious he never cracks jokes he's just really smart you just I can
see his mustached face today he's the kind of guy who just doesn't talk but
when he does say stuff it's really funny it's really interesting and I will
never forget that story I miss him so much he was such a great I mean I know
you know it's hard to you know you you get people that you work with intergrade
friends and I just really I really miss having having him around and and letting
me like transom and and Vera how are you wow speaking of having fun friends
around good to see you my friend please don't dox anything about yourself in
the moment this is going on YouTube we are just about ready to wrap up my my
good friend Vera's here so we will we'll be catching up in a bit so stop by
the YouTube channel stop by the Twitch channel if you want to watch me making a
lab I can't wait to hear all the things I'm doing wrong from Vera my friend
about my server I'm sure that everyone's gonna have an opinion on that
I've gotten used to it though it'll be fun talk to you later YouTube
