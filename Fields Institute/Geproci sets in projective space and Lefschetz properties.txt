Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me here, for letting me come here with Carolina, and for accepting the talk.
So I'm going to speak about the joint project with Luca Chiantini, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harvon, Juan Miliore, Thomas Schemberg and Justin Ashpond.
And for short, I will call these polytools because there are three Polish members, two Italian and two US-based members.
And this is our logo. See on my T-shirt, I guess Giuseppe also has the same T-shirt, but he didn't show me the talk.
So the logo is not just a logo, it has some meaning. I hope it will be visible after my talk.
The talk is based on two preprints. The first one is the same as Giuseppe was talking about, but not chapter two, the rest of chapters.
And the second is the new preprint from 2023. Both preprints are available at ARCH.
So let me start with the definition of the property.
So if we have a property P, whatever property you would like, and a finite set of points Z in the projective space over the fields of complex numbers.
I will drop this assumption. I won't write C in the next slide, but all the talk is for projective and dimensional space over C or then three-dimensional space.
And we say that a set C is a general projection from a general point to a hyperplane, which is isomorphic to Pn-1, as the property P.
So for example, we can think of the property P as being Gorinstein, and then we can speak of Gepro-Gorinstein sets.
We can also say about P being a complete intersection, so C, I, and that is how Gepro-G sets come from.
And there are lots of open problems connected with Gepro-P sets. So they are very open.
And the first is given a certain property, classify Gepro-P sets in Pn. So it is very, very general.
And this is the starting open problem. You can consider a property like being Gorinstein, and then you can try to classify Gepro-Gorinstein sets in Pn.
Okay, you can note that Gepro-Gorinstein sets are Gepro-Gorinstein sets, but not the other way around.
And you can also try to classify Gepro-G sets in Pn.
This is also very general, and in this talk I would like to say something about Gepro-G sets in P3, since we don't know any examples in Pn.
And we have some classifications in Pn. So let's move to P3, and from now on everything is going on in Pn.
So we say that a finite set of points Z is an AB Gepro-G set.
If its general projection to a plane is an intersection of curves of degree A and B.
So we have a set of points in P3, and we project this set from a general point to a general plane, and the result lies on the intersection of two curves of degree A and B.
This is an AB Gepro-G set.
And we call the set the Gepro-G set the generate if it is contained in a plane.
So here you have two curves, these curves are of degree two, and our set Z contains four points, the intersection points, and then if you take any point somewhere in the space P3 and you project to another plane,
the images of these curves would be the curves whose intersection is the complete intersection.
So this is a very simple example, and we don't want to speak about this kind of example.
The question asked by Francesco Polizzi in 2011 was whether every Gepro-G set in P3 is the generate.
So is it true that all these sets are in fact sets contained in a plane and projected to another plane?
So if we think about the answer, we may think about two curves in P3 intersecting, because in the plane it is what happens.
We have two curves which intersect and then we project and the images of these curves would give this complete intersection.
The theorem of Dufilda and Zias from 1986 says that if we have two smooth irreducible non-beginner curves in P3 of degrees A and B, then the number of intersection points is bounded by this number.
So it is A-1 times B-1 plus 1, so it is not even close to A times B.
So this is not the way how we can construct the Gepro-G set.
Let me mention also the second part of the theorem, the maximal value achieved if both curves are on the same quadric.
And I want to mention it because quadrics play a role here in this CETR.
So as I have already said, the set of intersection points of two smooth irreducible non-beginner curves in P3 of degrees A and B is not an A-B Gepro-G set.
So we have to look for another method to construct or to give examples of such sets.
Okay, so let me tell you what was the answer. The answer was given by Dmitry Panov in the same year, in 2011.
Let me recall the question was, is every Gepro-G set degenerate?
So does the point lie on a surface already?
And Panov said, no, it is not true.
So there are sets of points which are not on a surface and are Gepro-G, and these sets are called grids.
So what is a grid? Let me say what is an A-B grid.
An A-B grid is a set of A times B points, which are of the form A intersected with B.
So the intersection of two sets.
The first set is the union of pairwise disjoint lines, and the second is the union of, let's say, more pairwise disjoint lines,
such that each line from the set A meets each line of the set B in exactly one point.
So today if we consider the sets in P3, we will just see on a simple example how it looks.
I took it from Brian's presentation, so.
And here we see a two or three grid.
So one set of lines is black lines, and the other set is the orange lines.
These are two sets in P3, having six intersection points, and these six intersection points are called the group.
And why grids are the proteasets?
So let us see on the example.
We have this grid in the space, and if we project from a general point in a space to a general hyperplane,
then we get the black lines are projected.
So black lines and the orange lines are projected to orange lines.
Of course now the lines intersect, but this is not a problem because we look at the intersection points of the two curves.
One curve is a black curve, and the other curve is the orange curve.
So the black curve intersects with the orange curve in six points, and this is the complete intersection.
So the grid above is the proteaset here, it is a two or three.
Okay, so we may now consider whether there are other grids which are not the generative and not grids.
We will call these sets non-trivial.
So trivial if they are the generative of grids, and now we are looking for non-trivial grids.
And the modified question of quality would look like this, is it true that every grids set in P3 is trivial?
And if it's not trivial, is it possible to classify with the proteasets at the productive equivalence?
Maybe not all, maybe just for some small number of points.
So let us look for, on the first example, this is the, the example is the D4 configuration.
And it was studied by Alessandra Bernarbi, Luca Quiantini, Graham Benham, Giuseppe Favacchio, Brian Harbourn, Juan Miore, Thomas Schenberg, and Justina Spahn during the previous lecture workshop in the Mediterranean.
So this configuration looks like this.
We have, we have, let's think of a cube, so eight vertices.
Here we have six vertices, and the, sorry, seven vertices, and the other one is hidden behind.
So we take these eight vertices, then we add the vertices, which are the centers of perspectives of all the faces of the cube, and we add the middle point of the cube.
So altogether, these are 12 points, and these, these 12 points form a D4 configuration.
We may also give coordinates to the points, especially when somebody doesn't like to speak about the cube in the productive space.
So this is a set of 12 points with such configuration, such coordinates, is the D4 configuration.
And the D4 configuration lies on four disjoint lines, on different sets of four disjoint lines, let me tell you one set, so this is the set here on this slide.
So, if we have this D4 configuration in P3, we can project to a plane from a general point.
And then, of course, if we project collinear points, we get collinear points in P2, in the hyperplane to which we project.
So, we may take the solid lines, this is one line, then the other line, and this line, these are the lines which cover nine points of the configuration.
And there is also one more line which goes through the front vertex, the middle vertex, and the vertex in the back.
So, if you project the black lines, go to black lines on the right-hand side, this line, which is not visible, the points are not visible, goes to the grey line.
And because the points lie on a cone of P3, we have also the curve of D3 after projection.
So, we can choose the lines differently, so we can choose, for example, the dashed line or the dotted line.
So, there are more possibilities to choose the lines, but in any case, after the projection, the twelve sets lie on four lines and a cubic curve.
So, this is a 3-4 Geoprochi set on the bridge.
And it is not agreed why it is not agreed, because we cannot take the curve of D3 to be three lines, because of the position.
We have also another example, it is a four configuration, which I cannot draw, but I can give you the coordinates of the points.
And this configuration consists of 24 points, so two times D4, the number of points in D4, and this is not the coincidence, because the points which are green here are exactly the points of D4 configuration.
And the rest of the points are also D4 configuration, but not somewhere away.
So, two D4 configuration grew up to an F4 configuration of 24 points, which lies on six, these joined lines, and it's not a 4-6 Geoprochi set.
And it is built up with a 4-4 grid, and on a quadric, and two sets of four points, which are aligned.
So, in the case of D4, there was a 3-3 grid inside, and a line outside, now we have 4-4 grid, and two lines outside of the grid.
And we may ask the question, for which pairs of positive integers, A and B, let's say that M, A is less or equal than B, does there exist a non-trivial Geoprochi set?
So, a set which is non-degenerate, and it's not very quick.
And we know the theorem from the paper of Chantini and Lyore, published in 2021, that if we have a set of non-degenerate and non-degenerate A, B, Geoprochi sets, when both of A and B are at most three, then Z is a grid.
So, the first, the smaller numbers that can occur as A and B, for the sets not to be at grid, maybe three and four.
So, the question is to classify all three-four Geoprochi sets into three.
And we have a theorem in the print from 2022, that if a set Z is a non-degenerate 3B Geoprochi set in B3, then there are two possibilities.
The first one is that it is a 3B grid, and B is any number, we assume just B is greater than 3.
And the other option is that it is a D4 configuration, so a 3, 4 Geoprochi.
So, this means that there are no Geoprochi sets, like 3B Geoprochi sets for B greater than 4.
And the proof goes through different cases, whether the points are in general position, linear general position, or like on the twist of cubic, there are several cases which we consider.
And we come to this result that if you have 3B Geoprochi sets, that it must be a D4 or a 3B grid.
And so, we ask a question for which pair of integers A and B, which are both above three, and further exist non-degenerate, non-grid AB Geoprochi sets in B3.
So, if you are given AB, can you construct an AB Geoprochi set, if this A is greater than 3 and B is greater, B is at least A.
And we manage to give a construction for every pair of AB, at least four.
The construction goes like this, we take the primitive n root of unity, and we take the set of points in P1, which consists of points 11, 1u, 1u to the power, the second power and so on, up to 1 and u to the power n minus 1.
And now we construct the product of these points.
So, we look at the points as row or columns vectors, we multiply them, and we get a 4 by 4 matrices by multiplying 1 by 1 every set, every point from A with every point from A.
And we write these matrices as row vectors.
So, these are all the multiples of row vector matrices from A.
And we consider the set set to be the set of all these points plus, and we consider also two other sets of points, y1 and y2, which are sets of collinar points.
The set x is on a quadric, it is a grid, and y and y1 are outside of this quadric.
And the theorem says that if n is a positive integer, which is at least 3, then we have two options.
If n is odd, then the set x plus y1 and the set x plus y2 are n times n plus 1 to 40 sets.
And in case n is even, then also the set x plus y1 plus y2 is an n plus 2 to 40 set.
And also the sets mentioned in the first part are the priority sets.
And moreover, the sets constructed by the standard construction are not grids.
So, we are able to construct an AB, the priority set, when A is at least 3, for B equal A plus 1 and A odd, or for B equal A plus 2, or A plus 2, and A even.
But we want to construct also the priority sets when the factors, the A and B are different for more than 2.
So we have this useful lemma, then if we have a priority set, which contains a priority subset, so we have an AB priority set, and it contains a CB priority subset, Z prime.
And a general projection of Z prime shares with the general projection of Z, a minimal generator of the grid B, the second number.
Then the residual set, the B's, which is equal Z minus Z prime, is A minus C, B, the priority.
So this lemma allows us to construct the priority sets, which are when the A and B are not different by one, but by more.
So as a colorari, we get that for every pair of positive integers, when A is at least 4, at B is at least A, there exists a non-degraded and non-degenerate AB, the priority set of points in B3.
So now I would like to tell you how this is linked to the weak-lefted property, and the link is via unexpected cones, so there will be a few words about unexpected cones, and then we come to weak-lefted.
And I have shown you the sets D4 and D and F4.
These sets come from the root systems, and they are proved to have unexpected cones.
This is the paper of Harbour, Miljore, Nagel and Piper, published in 2012.
And these sets are also non-trivial, the priority sets, which was shown in the paper.
So the existence of the unexpected cone is equivalent to the filer of the weak-lefted property.
So if we denote the unexpected cone property by C of D, so this is the property of the existence of an unexpected hyper surface of degree D, and my PPCD.
So here, by Macaulay duality, sets Z satisfies C of D, if and only if the weak-lefted property fails in degree D minus 1.
So we have a set of points, P1 to PR, and we have the dual linear forms, L1 to LR, and we have another point, and also the dual linear form to this point.
And then the failure of the weak-lefted property in degree D minus 1 means that this multiplication doesn't have the maximal rank,
and this means that the cone is unexpected.
So now we may ask, because we know that these cones exist, for example for D4, for F4,
we may ask a question, do all the priorities set give failures of the weak-lefted property?
And this is open, so if there is a cone, an unexpected cone, we have the failure of weak-lefted property.
But if not, we don't know if there are the priorities sets which don't have this unexpected one.
And this is how we come to half-grid.
So all the sets we consider that were not degenerate and not grid were of the type that after projection we had some lines.
And this is what we call a half-grid.
So it is a grid in one way.
And if we had a non-degenerate, non-grid, the priorities set, we say that it is a half-grid if its projection is the intersection of two curves,
and exactly one of the curves can be taken as a union of lines.
So if both are the union of lines, that was the grid.
And now we consider only one curve to be the union of lines.
And as we have seen, the D4 is a 3-4 half-grid, and it lies on four lines.
And also all the sets, all the priorities sets obtained from the standard construction are half-grid.
And so we may ask a question, is every non-trivial grid a half-grid?
We don't have any general construction here, but we know three examples.
The first example is H4 configuration, which is a 6-10-14 set, and it was studied by Paulina Wichniewska and Maciej Sierba in 2021.
So this configuration also comes from the root system, but the maximal number of points on the line is 5, so this set cannot be covered by 10 lines.
Also, there are two more examples, one of them is the general configuration, which is a 5-8-12 set, and the other is a 10-12-12 set,
and the two last configurations are connected to quantum mechanics.
We don't know whether these examples are just the only ones or there exists some more.
It will be interesting to of course know this.
So this is an open question to decide whether there are other non-trivial, non-half-grid, general sets.
And if we don't know how to deal with non-trivial, non-half-grid, general sets, we may try to classify half-grids.
So how many non-projectively equivalent half-grids are there?
And we were studying this topic in the preprint from 2023, and the result is the classification of 4-4 half-grids.
So we assume that our set of points is a 4-4 half-grid in P3, and we discovered that there are two possibilities.
So the first one is the unharmonic case, and then in this case the points are as on the slide, and these are the coordinates of the points.
The epsilon is the primitive root of unit of order 6, and to visualize we can see that the points in the columns are in line,
and also the last row is the row of combinator points.
So one possibility is that the four points lie on four, let's say vertical lines, and also the four plus points lie on a horizontal line.
And the second possibility is called the harmonic case, the points have coordinates as on the slide, and the collinations are just the vertical ones,
so the points in the columns are collinear, and there are no collinearities in the rows.
So how this is done, I'm not going into details, I will just tell you some tools we are using, so we consider permutations which leave the cross-racial invariant.
We have four points on each line, so we may say about the cross-racial of this point.
And we use the notation a, j, k, l is the permutation, which sends 1 to i, 2 to j, 3 to k, and 4 to l, so this is not a cycle, that's why the commas between the numbers.
So with this notation, first it is well known that the cross-racial is invariant under the line group, so this means that with this notation, if sigma is one of the four permutations listed on the slide, then the cross-racial is invariant.
But these permutations are involuntary, but there are also two more cases which leave the cross-racial invariant, and this is the harmonic and unharmonic case.
So in the harmonic case, the cross-racial is one of the numbers minus one, one-half and two, and then we have eight more permutations which leave the cross-racial invariant.
And in the unharmonic case, we have 12 more permutations which leave the cross-racial invariant.
So we study how the permutation of points on, how the cross-racial on points on one line is read as a permutation of points on the second line and so forth.
Also the proof uses the fact that if you have four lines in P3 and they are not on the quadric surface, then there are two transversals of these lines.
And also what is very useful is that we can use this result from previous considerations, so if you have four lines and our half grid lies on these four lines and we consider the set without one line,
and then our points form a three-four grid.
So how do we know it?
They could, the half grid is a deprotis set, so if we take out a line, we get a three-four deprotis set, and there are two options, one is a grid, and the other is a default configuration, but the default configuration doesn't have four aligned points.
And this must be, and using this and considering how the permutations on, how the points on the line go to the points on another line using this cross-racial.
We can, we get to the theorem that gives, that only this harmonic and unharmonic case, let me go back to this, so only this harmonic and unharmonic case are half grids, which, so these are two different type of grids,
which are not projectively equivalent, and these are the only possibilities for four-four half grids.
So what can we do now?
We can try to classify the four B half grids in P3, and here we also have these transverse cells, so we know how to start at least.
The open problem is to classify AB half grids, where A is at least five, and B is greater or equal than eight.
So this is all, thank you, and I hope now you know that this logo is, the default configuration is somehow in this logo,
you'll know why we are wearing these t-shirts. Thank you.
