Listen, it's wonderful to see you all, all 334 and rising. I'm Jonathan Ryerson. I'm
chief executive and co-founder of Perspectiva who are putting on tonight's event. We're also
very proud publishers of Ian's most recent book, The Matter with Things. I'm going to
work on the assumption that you know Ian pretty well, but he is as well as a now quite famous
author and he's quite there more in the North American sense of very rather than the sort
of British sense of not so much really, you know, very, very much a famous and celebrated
writer and thinker with an increasingly international reputation. So it's no wonder that so many
of you are here to see him. Tonight we're going to carry on our series called Attention
as a Moral Act. And we've spoken already in the first session of what we meant by that.
We might sort of reiterate it a little bit tonight. Some of you may know the first session
was between Ian and I. We were sort of trying to reassert, reaffirm, reestablish the nature
of Ian's most fundamental argument. We spoke a little bit about my own take on it, calling
it the McGilchrist maneuver. And we tried to establish what that was. And we just more
generally sort of updated ourselves prior to the plunge into the more specific aspects
of the book. In the second session, we spoke with Zachary Stein, who had an amazing conversation
with Ian about value as a fundamental feature of the cosmos. It was a very richly metaphysical,
somewhat spiritual, fundamental conversation about the nature of reality. And we've had
a great deal of positive feedback about it since. As some of you may know, in between
our sessions, we also have bi-weekly connection and inquiry sessions, which are run by Michael
and Lee, my colleagues. And so if you have questions or you want to have further conversations,
you're welcome to just go to those events. And they're quite informal and you have a
chance to reflect and do some practices and get to know the work a bit more deeply. Tonight
we have an unusual situation, which is that earlier today, I was in touch with Bonita
Roy, whom I've known for quite some time. And she gave me chapter and verse on how
she's prepared for this evening's event. And she will be joining us very shortly. For some
reason, we can't currently contact her. And we're waiting for her to arrive. So I'm going
to briefly introduce her. I hope that she shows up. And if she doesn't show up, I'm
going to begin speaking to Ian, myself, partly based on Bonita's notes. But it's just a matter
of time until she shows up, because we have now reminded her. And my only assumption is that
she may have got the time zone conversion mixed up because of some daylight saving time change,
which we thought we were on top of, but evidently not. So give us a few minutes as she
manifests herself. Bonita, many of you will know already. But many of you may not. And
she's really a rather extraordinary human being with a multitude of different character traits,
skills, assets, interests. It's quite rare for someone to get deeply into metaphysical
philosophy. And by that, I don't mean so much the metaphysical and the sort of new age sort of
irrational kind of philosophy. I mean, more profoundly an engagement with metaphysics as it
studied in classical philosophy and in analytic philosophy. And she's written papers on why
metaphysics matters. She wrote one of the most profound chapters in a book released by
Perspectiva Press called Dispatches from a Time Between Worlds. And it was about the idea of
metamorphosis. And a lot of Bonita's work is about emphasizing not just the kind of how we
have to improve things, but also a little bit about how we have to allow things to end. Michael,
are you showing me signs of life there or am I imagining it? I'm imagining it. Okay. So Bonita
is also a horse trainer, a farmer. And like Ian, she describes herself as a Taoist.
One of my favorite conversations with her was when she spoke about the enormous tomatoes that
she had in her farm after using some unsuspecting variety of manures to make them grow. But she'll
switch from that to speaking about, you know, whitehead and heart short and so on. So Bonita
is a rather extraordinary person. And I'm very much hoping she'll join us in just a second.
Just check. I'm just noticing I have a problem with my battery. So if I disappear too, Michael,
you'll have to take it up. I think I've got it covered, but just a second. So I want to start,
Ian, with a question that Bonnie was going to ask you. She had something else to say first,
but I'll let her say that because it's very personal to her. She was very interested in your
subtitle. She wants to understand a little bit more about after the matter with things, which
you might want to remind us why you chose that title. More precisely, the subtitle, our brains,
our delusions and the unmaking of the world. And I know it took you quite a while to come up with
that. But if you can share anything about why exactly those words and what you're getting at,
I know that's one thing Bonnie wanted to ask you. Well, of course, in choosing the title
in the matter with things, I was addressing myself to the idea that we often have problems
understanding elements of our experience because we thingify them. We see them as things. And
in essence, many of the things that we think of in this way, I think a better thought of
is adverbs, probably. In other words, they are not elements that we have to pin down or we can
find in certain places, but they are ways in which we relate to everything else that exists. And so
the idea would be that you don't look for an entity, but a web of relationships that allows
what this entity is thought to refer to to become real. It's always a reverberative relationship.
Why I chose the subtitle is, of course, it has a kind of glancing nod towards the subtitle of the
master and his emissary. But what I'm talking about there is that I believe that we've
started to use our brains in a particularly limited way. When I say started, I think we've
been doing it now for a couple of hundred years at least, in which we disattend to whatever it is,
the right hemisphere is able to tell us, and instead focus on what the left hemisphere would
have us believe. And the delusions come from, as I demonstrate in the first nine chapters of the
book, which are all dedicated to neuroscience. And it's more fascinating, I hope, than that makes
it sound. It's not abstract. It's looking at what actually happens to people and their lives and
their world and their whole way of being when part of their brain is not functioning correctly.
And this may be because of an injury to the right hemisphere or a stroke in the right hemisphere,
but it may also be because of developing a disease such as schizophrenia, which has many,
many, many parallels with the right hemisphere deficit state. And I go into all of that in that
chapter. And the left hemisphere is literally deluded. And that's not just me who says that.
I'm very happy to quote other, and I do, other neuro-psychiatrists who say, yes, the left hemisphere
is on its own deluded. Sorry, Jonathan, are you... No, just for a point of clarification, because
the word delusion is used a lot. And I know you're very precise with your words. It's one of the
reasons people love your words so much. What exactly is a delusion? I mean, as opposed to an
unreality and illusion and lots of other concepts around it, what makes a delusion as such?
Well, I think that the standard definition is something like an incorrigible false belief
that is not explained by the person's culture or other context. So, you know, there are things
that we would call unexplained false beliefs, but they're part of somebody's religion. And
it doesn't mean that they've become crazy. It means that because of belonging to that religion,
that's the way they think, for example. And so, it's got to be something, and it's not just
false, but it is in this sense incorrigible, because there are false beliefs which can be
corrected. But in the case of a delusion, it is pointless arguing with somebody about it, because
you're relying on a shared way of seeing the world, that is, as it were, yours and mine, and the
patients, in order to explain to the patient that this cannot be the case. But you've got to remember
that for the patient, the whole world that they are experiencing is based on this certain way of,
that certain disposition towards it, this way of experiencing it. And so, it's a very obvious and
a very obvious and common observation that however bizarre a delusion is,
it is absolutely fruitless trying to argue with the patient about whether this is evidentially
likely. And also, there's a sort of gray area where, for example, you may believe that your spouse
is unfaithful to you, and your spouse may be being unfaithful to you, but there is still
a delusional way of believing it, because you believe it not in the way that somebody would
normally frame this, but you believe it with a sort of determination and on the basis of evidence
that other people would not consider a reasonable basis for making decisions. So, there's no very,
very clear way of putting it, but when you meet somebody who's deluded, you sure know what you're
encountering. And I believe that we as a society have started to believe obviously false things
about ourselves that experience, intuition, the business of living, would tell us must be false,
and have always been seen by people as false, but we now believe them to be the case. So,
that's that bit about the delusions and the unmaking. Joe, before you get to the unmaking,
I just want to get the delusions very clear, because, again, as with last week, sorry,
two weeks ago when we had the necessary, but sometimes confusing, elision between value and
values. With delusion and delusions, I'm just curious, you're speaking in the subtitle about
particular delusions that you outline in those chapters that you mentioned,
but there's also something you say about shared reality here. So, I'm just getting,
wondering the relationship between particular delusions, which might make it difficult for
people to interact in a shared reality, and the idea that the whole perception that shared is
somehow deluded. And what it's like, are we living in both of those kinds of delusion, or
and if so, what's the relationship between them? And if you don't mind while you answer that,
I have to go and get another charger for my computer, or they will disappear. So,
I'm still with you. I'm turning off my video, and I'll be back. So, make it a long,
good answer. I'll be back in two minutes. Thank you. I'll do my best.
Yes, I see the distinction that Jonathan's making there. And, you know, for example,
if we are as a whole society seeing things in a certain way, is this still delusional,
since part of the idea of delusion is believing something that cannot be explained by your
societal beliefs? And I suppose this is a very new situation. I don't think there's been an
example in the past where a whole society has been in the grip of ways of thinking that are,
frankly, delusional, and like those that are held by patients with major psychoses who are
out of touch with reality. And so, this is a new era that we've entered where,
as it were, there is a mass psychosis. And I don't think I'm the only person actually who's
used that conception of a mass psychosis. But what we see is that, for example, people with
delusions based on the fact that they have got a psychotic illness, will find many things
apparent that we would not think apparent and make things that we do see apparent as
completely probable or impossible. And I could go back to chapter nine,
which is the chapter in which I do look at schizophrenia, but just illuminate the,
I don't know, possibly I would say about 30 different ways in which people with schizophrenia
demonstrate the same sorts of aberrational thinking that we do. And one thing that's
interesting about this is that it, I mean, a lot of it, one might think is because we're
interacting with machines, people with schizophrenia see themselves as machines often,
and call themselves machines, and have been known to do things like cut open their wrists to see
whether there's blood or engine oil in their veins. So they can often have this very disturbing
feeling that nothing is right. It's all mechanical. It's all abstracted engineering,
rather than anything embodied. Sorry. I put my hand up because I've got an email notification
from our esteemed guest that she's waiting to be let in. Yeah. Oh, good. Yeah, I just want to say
Hey, so here we go. You've managed to bring fabulous. Yeah. And I'm just gonna bring it up
to speed then and let you take over from there. Hi, Bonnie. Nice to see you. Are you with us?
I am. Sorry. I'm so sorry about my tardiness. No, that's okay. That's okay.
To have you with us. You may not, I know you've been in touch with Ian by email, but nice to
introduce you. I'll be in front of 300 odd people. So, you know, I've spoken with many times and I
think you'll know, Bonnie, I've already introduced you to some extent to the audience. What I didn't
mention is that over the last year or so, you've maybe more than a year now, you've created
something with a lovely fetching straightforward title, a pop-up school. And just briefly tell us
what a pop-up, what your pop-up school is so that before we get into the discussion, people get a
better sense of where you're coming from. Well, hi, Ian. Nice to see you. Hello.
So, for almost 15 years, I taught a master's course in consciousness studies in transpersonal
psychology or transformational psychology, which we called it at the end. And COVID pretty much
was the straw that broke the back for that program, which was always kind of an off-broadway
struggling private program. And so, I graduated my last cohort in August of 2022. And in August of
2021, kind of anticipating the end of that, I wanted to offer something similar that was equally
robust that could speak to what people were starving for, but had a much lower onboarding
threshold. So instead of paying $17,000 a year, you could pay like $40 a month. And I kind of
modified substack so people could enroll on an off or enroll on a yearly basis. And I called it
the pop-up school because in Zach Stein, whom you met a couple of weeks ago, Ian, in his book,
he predicted that schools might be these little pop-up initiatives. And I wanted to give it this
sense of like serial learning, like you could pop in and pop out. And yeah, so it's been almost
two years now. And it's quite a growing, growing community. And I suspect there's several of the
students or our community on this call today. Okay, great. Well, I'm glad to hear it. And,
Bonnie, while you're getting settled, just as far as I understand it, where we were in the conversation
was, I didn't say anything about your observations about the book, but I did use your email from
this morning to ask Ian about the subtitle. And so we spoke a little bit about why the matter
with things. We spoke a little bit about brains, which could be somewhat self-evident. We spoke
a little bit about delusions and the difference between delusion sort of singular and delusions
plural and individual and collective delusions, but only really scratch the surface of that.
And Ian was just about to come on to the unmaking of the world when various things kicked off,
including my computer running out of battery. So Ian, if you want to finish that thought on why
the unmaking of the world allowed me to get settled. And once you finish that, I'm happy to
disappear until the Q&A. So if you can go on the unmaking of the world, Michael, you can allow me
to disappear. Yes. And then you carry on talking together. And I'll be back with the Q&A in about
50 minutes. Is what I wanted to indicate by the phrase the unmaking of the world
is that the various habits of mind that I believe are toxic, which we've adopted
more in the last few decades, but certainly going back further than that, the last century or two,
lead to us no longer having a world. And a world is a very special thing. If you like to put it
that way, it's an experience really, like all the things I talk about. It's not really a thing,
but it's a place in which we dwell. It's a home. It's a living thing. And therefore, in
schematizing, mechanizing, abstracting, decontextualizing, ignoring the uniqueness of
individual cases, ignoring the individual uniqueness of people, we have come to inhabit
an enormously impoverished version of what that world should be. We're in a sort of lost place,
which has none of the feel of a living, vibrant world in which we are committed,
orientated, and find a place of being. That's really what I was guessing at.
Yeah, so thank you. When I read that, I was struck by, I just had this impression you put
a lot of thought into the subtitle, and that it was a more poignant message maybe than a lot of
people might think about at first. And something that strikes me as being a grave concern, I think
there's a lot at stake. I think you would agree that there's a lot at stake. And I think sometimes
people think, yeah, they take you seriously, but they think it's like a metaphor. And I think that
it's more than a metaphor. It's more than a passing concern. It's more than almost a sci-fi movie,
let's say. Some people with all these crises go into their consciousness like it's almost a sci-fi
movie. It makes us nervous, but I think that for me, a lot of what you're talking about, I see
every day. I've seen the erosion of the adult mind through the 15 years that I've been doing
teaching. And of course, my course selects people who have maybe a little bit of spiritual
emergencies and stuff, but the nature of the question of whether reality is real is extraordinary
now. And these programs that people go to, that question whether we share the same world or we
all have different worlds. And I know the sense in which we all live in our own perspective,
but the emphasis is always on that the world is a simulation, that we share different worlds, like
this sense that the humanities and the science are teaching this extraordinary fragmentation
and I call it locked-in syndrome, that we can't perceive the world really. And my question for you
is where is the fever? Why are we so feverishly trying to convince ourselves that we live in
a simulation? I mean, where is that pain coming from that we don't want to live in, let's say,
the natural world? Gosh, there's so many things to say about that. Well, one is that the natural world
imposes limits on us, like we die and we have bodies that have certain inclinations and so on.
We're busy trying to pretend that none of this is true and we can remake everything according to
our whim, but that is not the case. And in fact, the limits that are imposed by life are extremely
healthful and important. It's a mistake to think that we ought to be railing against them and trying
to get rid of them in my view. But of course, like everything, it's a matter of degree.
Nature is something that medicine has always interfered with. Nature tries to, medicine tries
to overcome some of the unnecessarily adverse effects of disease and so forth. So we are always
juggling these things. I think another reason why we're addicted to this idea of a representation is
because the left hemisphere is a representation of the world. The right hemisphere has a presencing
of the world. It is, allows the world to presence to us. That is a vibrant two-way experience. But
once it is taken up by the left hemisphere, it is dislocated, dismembered, analyzed, categorized,
and turned into something abstract, a map of the world. You cannot live in a map. You've
unmade the world once you do that. But the left hemisphere can only trust the things that it has,
it has itself has made. It wants to, Heidegger actually said that he was, of course, not talking
about hemispheres at all, but he did say that modern man needs to be able to tell himself that
he is the giver to himself of everything that he has. And that is part of this problem that we have,
that we must be the all-powerful and we must be the one that can do anything. This is extraordinary
because for decades I've been puzzled by the kind of paradox that at the same time
we believe ourselves to be capable of doing almost anything we want to,
and believe ourselves to be basically pointless, worthless. So the dignity of humanity has hugely
plummeted, and so is its happiness and its sense of belonging and everything else, at the same time
that our hubris about humanity has gone through the roof. So adopting a certain degree of modesty
and a sense of proper limits to what we can do and what we can know would actually perhaps help us
to regain a sense of respect for what we in fact are and what we can do. But those would be some
of the thoughts I'd have about why that is so promoted, and I'm afraid it is very much promoted,
and I just like to say that there are a number of philosophers amongst the foremost at the
moment is Donald Hoffman, who says that what we see is a readout of an instrument panel.
This is an idea that has been offered many times in the past and was really in Damasio's
early work as well, for which I criticised him and for which he hasn't forgiven me.
But this idea that actually what we're doing is reading out something,
which is what the left hemisphere does, but in fact we're experiencing something real. There are
things in the cosmos that correspond to all those things that we perceive and value.
Now I'm not saying that there's only one way of seeing them, but once again in our culture,
what we've done is we've taken a partial truth and made it the whole story. So it is true that
everyone to some extent sees the world differently, and that's an important and beautiful fact,
but it is also a very important and beautiful fact that generally speaking we see things
in a common world. We don't all live in so vastly different worlds that we have no common ground.
And at the moment there's a general tendency to say that if something is the case up to a
degree, which wasn't thought to be so perhaps recently, then it's true to the max across the
board. We go to extremes, we have black and white positions, and I'd like to present myself as a
photo of black and white positions. It's very important that there are matters of degree and
things that are implicit and not fully made explicit. So you said that we kind of have this
hubris that we imagine ourselves are all powerful, that all the gifts we have we've made ourselves.
And it seems to me that there's a pickle in this because somehow deep down inside we do know that
we haven't made the earth and we haven't made the trees and we haven't made ourselves and everything
that we actually are has been given to us freely by nature through no account of our own. I mean
this is more you know people will when I say that they say oh that's very spiritual and I say no
it's just a strong naturalism. It's just actually the case it's rather mundane and for me there's
something that if I thought I was responsible for booting up my enthusiasm every morning I would
be overwhelmed you know. It's like so much of who we are that gives us the possibility to pretend
we're all powerful comes to us through this intelligence that we don't we don't maybe you
know we don't have you know it's not it's not been it's all given to us and so it seems to me
like the thing I can't understand is that and I don't know this is seem off topic to you or is
this kind of interesting to talk about. Yeah so I went to a conference the other day and this young
man was presenting an argument that that the world is intelligible and that communication
between people is possible and to do that he took this huge journey through theoretical cognitive
science and opponent processing and and free energy principle and I thought something very odd
he's a very nice man and I thought something very odd is happening here like if if people had to
understand all that to understand that the world is intelligible it's a possibility of communication
that most people would be lost and I thought like I told my dog you have absolutely no no
chance at all for being in the world you know and so this question this crisis of how so this is
an example of something that looked like a well presented presentation but it really was to me
a sense of collective madness and and yeah. No well this kind of thing goes on all the time
it's just that we've completely lost any kind of contact with the live intuitive
reverberative business of experiencing the world in which the world approaches us becomes available
to us and we to it and it's in this encounter that whatever it is that we we we know comes about
so what you're describing is this unnecessarily complex way of approaching it and there's a lot
of this in science in which frankly the extraordinarily opposite is sorry obvious
I meant to say extraordinary obvious is demonstrated at costly and great length
where at the same time oddly there are things that are completely obvious that are wholly denied
and people go around believing them because they think oh well people say this so I better
believe it and but I want a bit of the touch of the little boy who said the emperor's wearing no
clothes yeah I mean I'm sorry guys he's nude and there's just so much rubbish talk these days
and it's very confusing disorientating to people and leads them to a sense of desperation they
don't know what to believe who to believe what to believe in their intuitive spirituality has
been deadened by the way they've been brought up and by everything they experience in the world
their capacity to pay continuous sustained vigilant attention open attention respectful
attention the sort of attention that leads to real sense of meaning and or is has been
undermined and they've been told they have thousands of choices that in reality are not helpful
and it's a well-known fact in in psychological research that beyond the few choices too many
choices make people less happy more stressed than they would have been content with fewer choices
so it's not as I'm always saying it's not an argument for having no choice but it's an argument
for saying that choice doesn't get better and better if you try and say well you can be anything
you want you can't I mean get real it's a horrible fantasy that creates enormous stress and the fear
of missing out and the fear of having failed and the need to do all kinds of incompatible things
at once in order to prove that you're okay it's a horrible world to bring up young people in I mean I
just feel for young people whose rates of mental illness are just zooming through the roof
yeah so we do live live in a mad world my master's when you think of young people it's really very
sad and and I read a statistics that one out of very 16 kids in the United States is diagnosed
with a severe mental illness and whether it's because the DSM has gone mad or the children
have gone mad it doesn't really matter it's an alarming alarming fact and you know I talked to
sometimes I coach some young parents and we we we try to teach parents how to have unstructured
time with their children and and I often get the response you know I I blocked out time
she was playing I was there nothing was happening but I got bored I don't know what to do with my
body I don't know how to put my body in a in play I don't I'm just stiff and I pretend and and and
this is all by way of trying to say to the listeners like it's not a joke and it's not
science fiction and something really disturbing is happening right in front of our eyes
but I thought you know I have this this note here and there's this beautiful word that you use
if I don't know how to say it city of city
it's a tea it's a tea and you have a quote from sass in his book about this crucial self
sense of self sameness a fundamental and therefore nearly indescribable experience of
existing as a vital and self identity identical subject of experience in action
and and I thought this is one of these experiences that we can no longer take for granted that
people have any intuition of and so I thought maybe you could if you were talking to aliens
who had had had not this experience what what what is what is that experience
the trouble is that it's not something that's improved by being put into words it's something
that has to be experienced and I take the word it say it largely from louis sass
and a very great mind I think and and what he's talking about there is the natural
unselfconscious awareness of a continuous functioning self we've so eroded our intuition
and we've been encouraged to attack our intuitions to reject our intuitions that we can no longer
act unselfconsciously and this happens in schizophrenia people say I don't know how to
walk I have to think put one foot in front of the other and so on I don't know how to sit down
or whatever it may be so they've become paralyzed by a kind of gorgon stare of the intellect on
everything they're doing and the beauty of life is that things work well only when it's not like
that imagine um how bad the performance of a piece of music would be if the pianist was
thinking all the time consciously about what he was doing with his fingers imagine how um
how diminished an act of sexual love would be if it was entirely contrived according to
a plan an algorithm or a worked out schema it's this way of thinking that is absolutely crazy
and a huge affliction and makes life impossibly difficult for us
the trouble is that if we adopt a legalistic frame of mind I mean a lot of this comes back
to a sort of legalistic um incorporation of um the redress in the the redress for any kind of
wrong that happens to you is to accuse somebody so nowadays we we we have this sort of idea or
some people seem to have this idea that we are owed a pain-free life and if there's pain there's
suffering things are not good in it there's somebody to blame for that and they must be
brought to account preferably through the law this has a deleterious effect on whole ways of life
where in fact we need to trust and to accept that there will be ups and downs and things but not
to become um you know reaching for our handy attorney at every turn in events this is the
problem and this is why schools schools find teachers harder to recruit hospitals are finding
doctors harder to recruit because first of all they've been told that unless they follow certain
written procedures they will be vulnerable to being sued and that will completely destroy their
career and and that's you know nothing any longer can be done according to the wonderful way in which
I was taught and it was taught medicine too which was from experience from people who'd had you
know 40 years of experience of whatever it was talking to me from that base of what goes well
and what doesn't and and you know the teachers at school were people who had had an enormous
enthusiasm for things that they had learned to love and they communicated that to me and that's
in itself worth a thousand hours of just following rules and procedures it's this awful business of
rules procedures theories that have overtaken our ability to be naturally responsive creatures and
when we can try to recover that we may be able to get back some of our moral self because that's
also a very important thing isn't it I mean since we have rules about absolutely everything now I
think back to when I was was young and one I mean it's a it's a cliche but one didn't need to have
the same numbers of locks and the word cameras watching everything and so on but on the whole
although certainly crime existed it didn't seem to exist on the level that it would if we now took
away all the the locks and the and the cameras that we've since instituted and there's a sort of
belief that if you can get away with it then you're entitled to do so there's no kind of strong
innocence of I would never do this because I'm not that kind of person and I don't want to live in
a world where human beings do this kind of thing that seems to me one of the most important moral
stimuli to action I don't want to do this because I don't want to be in a world where we can assume
that people will do this unless some law restrains them from doing it so we've moved such a terrifically
long way from anything intrinsic and spontaneous and intuitive and to the world of somebody who
is unable to stand unless they've got scaffolding all around them a support and of course such a
person is a feeble version of a healthy living individual yeah and of course that's what you
think about that yeah and of course that scaffolding is actually fragmented right just like this so
I was thinking of the other day we were talking about wisdom like what is it to cultivate wisdom
and I was saying that years ago both of us will use that phrase quite a bit I think
doctor for example could grow wise in his career right so he would give birth to children he'd
watch them grow he put their help their parents in the dying process he'd be in the community
and this kind of embedded in the community in the local with his expertise having what I call
voluntary obligation to his practice through the thick and thin and the difficulties this
is a formula for having wise people embedded in relationships but a doctor's career is not
a formula for wisdom today not at all it's completely fragmented and they're systematically
standardizing things so all the doctor does is go on the computer and tell you something so pretty
soon you don't need the doctor and we feel we've we've we've slowly redefined intelligence as
something machines are good at and say you see the standardizing of teaching the standards of
this is what machines are good at and now we have you know chat gpt is going to be our teachers
because it's better at that than we are but we've been we've redefined intelligence is what
people are good at well we need to redefine intelligence I mean yeah exactly yes I I mean
I I always say AI is not artificial intelligence it's artificial information processing and that's
what it does but intelligence involves a full understanding and that can only come if you if
you are embodied if you have emotions if you form relations on the basis of that and if you're aware
that you were only here for a while and are going to die the all these things are very important
to making us what we are we need all these elements including the element of death which is not our
foe but in many ways our friend that's a whole other topic but but I what I'm really saying is that
intelligence isn't is is at risk and I think you're saying this as well and being replaced
by just very rapidly and mechanically following every kind of pathway that a computer can find
but having no sense of a context in which to properly evaluate these things and and will
fill in things which are absolutely not true on the basis that it looks like in this pattern
this ought to be happening so it actually states that certain things have happened in a person's
life for example based on the probability but they didn't and that person rather specifically
didn't do those things so I mean not only have you got the problem of telling true from false
in educating children and and students who may waste their time and their teacher's time by
using chat gpt to write their essays but it will also make the the sphere of the law very
difficult our is the evidence fabricated what do we really believe here can we believe something
we see our politicians saying when you can't believe and you can't trust the civilization
collapses and you know that's this wonderful saying Chinese third century is saying one of the
emperors that for a society for a civilization to thrive you need guns food and trust and if you
have to do away with one of them do away with guns and if you have to do another one do away with
food but the one you cannot do away with this trust and we've done away with it
sorry I hope I haven't depressed you too badly don't you think of something
I see something good for the end
and now I think that what I'm trying to collaborate with you on is it's really to
open people's eyes we know we get so habituated to the way things are and open people's eyes to see
how extraordinarily unmade the world is I mean we we think we think we have to encounter people
who are paranoid schizophrenics to understand what you're talking about and yet this kind of
unmaking of the world is the world that is being unmade right right in front of our
right in front of our very eyes and
it's the world is an organism it's not a machine and the trouble with the way we think is that we
think it's just a machine and can therefore be reduced to parts and all we find after we've done
this is a lot of of material elements that have been broken out of a hole and the whole cannot
conceivably be reconstructed from these bits these inanimate bits and what I mean by the
unmaking of the world is all that structure all these relationships that enable things or people
and the feelings that they have experiences they have to interrelate with one another are being
shorn away the world view is becoming simpler and simpler and simpler not because it's approaching
truth but because it's moving away from truth it's it's running away to a blatant falsehood
which it feels it can't escape because of a certain way of thinking which is that the only
thing that matters is that we should be able to be in control and amass material goods those are
the values of the left hemisphere and all the other important values are better served by the
right and it's anyway that was what I talked about last week so we won't go there now I think that
another thing that um the way to another way to look at it and of course you've done incredible
detail on this is people a lot of times people are um let's say their teachers or educators or
their psychiatrists or their spiritual teachers they assume that the kinds of minds we have
is the nature of mind and then they try to work with that or or um you know people will say because
our minds are constructing reality and and I always say no that's the kind of mind we have
thinks it's a simulation but what I hear you saying is that this integrated mind and of course we
have to we're off balance so we're going to emphasize what the what we've lost with the
right brain a contribution this kind of mind looks at nature and sees home and and and moves
around the world and sees that every act of life is a gift from nature from my home from where I've
become um this kind of mind um trusts that um that there's such a larger intelligence that an
envelopes envelopes all of us and that's like a tissue from which we dialogue is possible
you know the left hemisphere like the difference between yake concepts as you know you hold your
baby like this and it's right hemisphere to right hemisphere and yet we're talking at odds like we
think that if we can come to some conceptually agreed upon solution then there's a possibility of
a communication and I'm saying that like because we our bodies are inhabit the tissue of the living
world then this is why this communication is possible not because it's an effort in this
direction it should be a joy in this direction and and yeah I I totally agree with that and I think
you know the phrase constructing the world is is very important because it's a fashionable
conception has been since the 60s that effectively um we make up the world according to um you know
who who we are then what we what we want but um I reject this idea that we um fabricate it
because that is dependent on this idea that we are cut off from any kind of reality and that
all we have are the bits that come to us in our in our mind and we put together a world out of those
but that is not in my view the case because we do have contact with something beyond ourselves
and unless you tell yourself that that cannot be and cut yourself off from it in which case
of course you won't find that there is anything beyond yourself if you don't do that but cultivate
a kind of humble awareness of things that are far beyond what we know right now you you start to
feel experience those things they start to to give you something with which to build the world
and so it's not a fabrication or a construction of the world it's a helping to bring into being
something that is there to bring it more into being and we play a part in that and so the world
comes about for each of us in a slightly different way because if each of us brings something different
to it but this is wonderful it's not a negation of the idea that there is a common core to the world
it's the idea that each person's contribution brings a slightly different uniqueness to an
aspect of the world we still have something that is vibrant living evolving it's not a finished
product it's a thing that is in process as we ourselves are in process and that process is a
resonant thing between our consciousness and whatever the rest of the conscious cosmos gives
that's my my view of it so instead of saying that we construct the world we make it up in some
mechanistic engineering way which is exactly how the left hemisphere would think was the only
possible way we are in fact if you're like midwifing into existence helping to burst
something that is natural something that is nature which is that which is always about to be
yeah so i want to move on a little bit and there's this notion this philosophical notion
which i think is is true and that is that reason i'm going to use the word reason because
rationality is is associated with just like left brain typically that reason is isomorphic to reality
in the sense that there's something about human reasoning and i'm not just talking about the
brain but you can unpack this that is isomorphic to reality such that there is the possibility
for a direct attunement let's say yes and um and so that's the first question and if you
can speak to that then there's a question just to build after after that to kind of yes
i i think that's a wonderful observation and i certainly believe this and i think i've made it
myself and in a way it was what einstein was saying when he said what is so wonderful and
so unexpected is that the world is understandable why should the world be understandable by our
minds and the idea that our minds would evolve naturally to understand the world
is not necessarily correct it might have adopted various kind of entirely false positions for a
while in order to deal with a certain situation but over time our understanding of the world has
increased i mean we i'm not saying that we most of us in in the modern world are making the best of
that fact but there is something heroic about the degree to which over thousands of years we have
come to understand more and more of the world and the world is um as david deutsch says speaking to
us in english i mean he means if english is your natural language why is it that when you approach
the world the world speaks to you in your own language which is another way of putting einstein's
remark about extraordinary fact and i think what this gives us is the opportunity to trust
what reason tells us not as you say i make this distinction between it's not really one that's
a core english distinction but we have to have two different words for it one is for simply
the following of rules and procedures in the way the computer would and the other is tempering all
that with the wisdom that comes from experience the understanding of context and so on and so
forth in fact what a wise judge would do you know you're talking about wisdom and interestingly
judges are being more and more constrained by mechanical sets of rules and procedures so that
they're no longer free to use um wisdom that they've acquired over an arduous training in and
decades of experience so that's what i say is that these things are naturally resonant and i do
also believe the imagination is like this and unfortunately we haven't got time to go into
that enormous topic of what is imagination but with courage and with shelling and so forth i take
the imagination to be a faculty which enables us to be in touch with reality beyond the things that
we can reason about it's not fantasy which takes us away from reality he makes a very strong
distinction between fantasy and imagination and imagination on the other hand is our one chance
of actually feeling our way into the inside of the world and experiencing it yeah that's that's
beautiful so my last question actually somebody asked me to tag on and that is so we have this
notion that reason is isomorphic with the world so there's a possibility for not only attunement but
yeah for deep mutuality um so the question and then is what is the relationship between
goodness and reason because it's a little hard tricky to say they're isomorphic
um well we're talking in a different way than we were about whether reason is isomorphic with
reality or perhaps even with truth i i distinguish between different kinds of meaning of truth
one being something abstract that we have an analytic past towards and we get closer and
finally we get it and a different one which is a form of attunement of coming together of meeting
of resonating a completely different kind of sense of truth and of course the word truth has
as a core this idea of being true to something of surfaces being true to one another as a carpenter
says or a couple being true to one another if they love one another so it is about a relationship
that is that is truthful and real and goodness um well all i would say is that reason is obviously
another tool that we can use in helping work out what is um good but it shouldn't be the only or
the limiting tool because there is very much more to goodness than calculation and one of the things
that um i i write about in chapter 26 i think is the way in which in academe in the west um the
philosophy of utilitarianism has more or less ousted every other kind of way of thinking about
what is naturally good and the odd thing is that what is being praised is a way of thinking which
is archetypally not good immoral to always calculate about things is immoral and often leads
you to um horrible conclusions that it's okay to kill one person in order to um harvest their organs
and give them to five other people awaiting transplants for example so um reason has a dual
aspect as it's there often that it can be extremely helpful but if used in a rigid fashion it approximates
what people who are mentally ill do with it people who have frontal damage right hemisphere
damage who are psychopaths and who have schizophrenia all have in common that their
idea of morality is based on rationalizing calculations whereas i hope that most of the
rest of us see it in a broader sense yeah that was the trick i think now that i now i understand it
thank you very much because what what what was the tension in his question was in the assumption
that goodness is utility right so that he it was like well when i'm reason when i reason i don't
always get the good but i but that was more like he yeah so now i understand what that
tension was but when i reason and i don't get what i want it may be the good and so then you start to
see that there is the potential for more attunement between reason and the good versus reason and then
thinking of the good as a utility especially an ego referential utility so that was that was very
helpful thank you very much i knew there was a thank you that kind of tension where there's an
assumption that is yeah yeah creating the tension in the question so yeah thank you very much thank
you bonnie and um i hope you don't mind if i come in yes you could you can uh i'm aware of
bonnie that another question might come to you as you're um you know watching the questions that
follow um but i want to give a chance for the audience to come in now um before that i just
want to i want to ask you one question um about something bonnie alluded to earlier vis-a-vis
what's at stake here um because we don't often flesh this out you know the source of the sense
of mattering um because you know there's a certain intuition about moral acts in our proximity about
good behavior with our peers and then our society and then you get into the health of the planet
you might think about the cosmos you might think about the ultimate nature of reality
you might even wonder about life on other planets and other forms of intelligent life as many do
and i say all of that because i've noticed between the two of you a sort of difference in tenor
um if i can if it's i think it's reasonable to say that in you um although there's you offer a
great deal of uh emphasis on beauty and love and goodness and there's a great deal of positivity
in your work it's also true that you lament a great deal about the world and there's a a certain
spirit of let's say melancholy about about how things are turning out and a sort of urgency to
to redirect things and re-perceive them that's the premise of your work bonnie with us sense
something altogether more chipper something altogether more kind of lively and playful
and i don't know i don't want to sort of make this too personal but i am just trying to get at this
idea of you know when we what's at stake are we talking about the end of human habitation on
planet earth are we talking about um the capacity to destroy ourselves with exponential technology
are we talking about the intrinsic value of things that will be destroyed pointlessly
can you give me some sense when you this question of what's at stake both of you please like what's
your sense of um why we should care about any of this if i can ask such a big context question
like ultimately at the end of these searches what are we trying to protect what are we trying to
safeguard what is it that actually matters to you both and i think even yours would be more
more familiar to people so i'm gonna come to bonnie first it's a great question um so for me
i'm trying to say i'm trying to say don't think what's at stake in the future don't worry about
what's coming don't take what we're saying and and draw it out in in a narrative arc and figure out
what's going to be left right we just be with reality right now every single person alive
is going to die is that a crisis it's just just you know what i'm saying if i put it within all
the middle crisis and everybody will die you have a different reality to it if we put it in
right here now what's at stake is every person in this call could be deeply wedded with reality
deeply feel belonging to the earth feel the generosity of having been given a life
experience the beauty of the perceptual world when you listen to read ian's
writing on music that people don't have those experiences anymore
the completely robbed of who people are the the fantastic joy and voyage of being a human being
is not present in people's lives they don't know how to get to it this is what's at stake
and in young people there's a struggle because they haven't yet forgotten something
and um you know used to be when i worked with young adults going through the individuation
stage let's say their problems were like problems with the intergenerational change
between their families different how societies conventions that change now they say things like
when i was seven i felt like i was hooked up to a machine that was sucking out my blood this is
like the the metaphors that seven-year-olds use like it's so bad now that young people who are
still kind of like organisms and then they don't blame their parents because they're like their
parents are sucked into the machine you know they use these metaphors it's extraordinary how
poignant the lack of world living world is for them and so for me what i think what's at stake is
you know trying to connect with young people make a world for them but right here and now
all the things that you may imagine were possible
are possible as long as you're still a living breathing organism and people don't believe that anymore
thank you bonnie and um it's lovely to hear you say that i've heard you say similar things but
great to hear it again um you know makes me think of the unmaking of the world again are we to
understand that the world is inevitably being unmade that it has to be unmade for it to be
remade or that we're called in some sense to protect what is already made
well i think what i'm saying is is that we are in the process of unmaking the world not that it has
to and not that it can't be reversed or but that we are we're simply unmaking it and and that's the
predicament we find ourselves in and that's not i can't just to be clear there's some people who
the reason i asked that question in that way is there are some people who want to tear it all down
that you know i have met people of persuasion and are they entirely wrong i mean how how do you see
this quite simply anybody who wants to just tear down a civilization or tear down a world is is
crazy foolish arrogant um what we need to do is to work with what is in fact as i say not a machine
but an organism to change the parts that we feel need to be changed and to respect the wholeness
of it and i find myself after your perfectly accurate portrayal of me as a miserable old
git i find myself i find myself curiously more optimistic perhaps than bonita in that i don't
think that people lack all these things i mean i'm sure she's right that the world is a much less
hospitable place than it was for finding these things for being encouraged to to to nourish
oneself on them and we're offering children a diet of gruel and which is a great shame but
but there'll always be people who will gravitate towards the magnificence of what the you know
what there is and who will see life as you and i i think both see it as a an awe inspiring gift
and and that this is a very important way to be i i often think you know if you say what do we do
and this is a famously difficult question to answer but i was thinking that there would be
some value in saying pray and what i wouldn't mean by that is well the only thing that's left open to
us now is to pray and hope that there's some divine being that will change it all that's not at all
what i mean what i mean is by adopting a devout and all filled compassionate vision of the world
not striving to know alter take and all the rest but actually to first of all to understand
is in all its awe inspiring complexity and that if we did that a lot of things would start happening
differently because so much of what's wrong is due to simple hubris the pronouncements of people who
think we can do it all and only a few more tweaks and we'll be able to achieve this that and the
other well this is this is how things get destroyed it's in all the old mythologies
the the arrogant know-it-all upstart who doesn't realize what he's destroying and becomes that
demi-edge that that brings the cosmos to ruin so that that's that's my thinking about that
i'm not surprised though that you ask jonathan so what is it that is worth saving or what is it
that we're trying to say because surely the answer to that is everything that inspires in us love and
beauty and and it speaks to us of all these things that are so life-enhancing i mean you can live in
a world in which everything is is is is bleak meaningless pointless i mean you can create that
for yourself but don't kid yourself that that's necessarily the reality you can also live in a
world where you are maximally responsive to what is what is good beautiful and true and worthy of
our love and respect and and that don't get me wrong good beautiful and true there's a reason
we have three different words they're not interchangeable with one another
they sometimes conflict with one another but nonetheless they have this family relationship
with one another in which all these positives come together they don't have to be mechanically
related they don't they hasn't doesn't have to be an algorithm saying go to beauty then if this
then go to good or it just doesn't work like that right right so i got a lot out of that answer
because um you know to be maximally responsive to the possibility of love or those were not your
words but but but paraphrasing the idea of being maximally responsive to what is good beautiful
and true is what's at stake in some sense and also reminds me in one back in the day at one
some seminar event you were at i once remember writing something down quickly because the
turn of phrase is so beautiful when you put it you said that life is life is a superfluous gift
calling for gratitude and tenderness and you said it off the bat as if it was one of many
lines but i'd love that particular formulation a superfluous gift calling for gratitude and
tenderness with that thought i want to bring in the others now the the technicalities of what's
about to follow are not altogether trivial so please pay attention and if you have a question
you'd like to answer ask and please type it in the chat while also putting your hand up
it's a double whammy we're asking you to do both because it helps us to find you you might think
it's just self-evident but we are we do have a 380 participants and we can only see them on a
relatively small screen a certain number at a time so if you raise your hand through the
reactions icon i believe um or at least one of the icons down below while simultaneously typing
your question and in some cases we'll ask you to speak it in some cases we'll read it out
also let me say this quite important point we're very keen to hear from all kinds of people
that i mean men and women i mean young and old and so if if you're in any doubt about
answering asking a question can i particularly encourage you to do so if you're feeling that
you're somewhat uncomfortable or not too sure if you should and we're very keen to get from here
from a wider variety of people as possible and we'll do everything we can to make that happen
okay with that thought in mind i'm going to look at the google doc that michael has
hopefully prepared for me um and i'll take a take one and while you're asked while you're
answering i'll look for others okay um the questions so far are very technical um but
actually there's one here from jane's van louen which i think is a good one it's a direct message
he says um and this comes to the premise of tonight's talk is there a root mass delusion
um is there something is there some i think that it's i understand the question he's trying to get a
um is there something inherent like a premise or an axiom or a fundamental part of the delusion
that we need to take stock of collectively and if so what is it and that's initially a question for
ian when i look through the other questions well i i suppose that um i would say inevitably that
that there is a core mass delusion which is indoctrination into the vision of the world
which is delivered to us by the left hemisphere untempered or relatively untempered by the right
and so it is one orientated towards um greed gain power i mean effectively it's about power and
control and it it's lost intellectual subtlety because the left hemisphere doesn't have much
intellectual subtlety and is literally less intelligent than the right it also has no
where near the understanding of social and emotional matters of intelligence and so
inevitably once this this way of thinking becomes the standard way in which all discourses
is carried on in the public sphere and children are brought up no longer to believe in or or take
pleasure in all the the the beautiful things that are now associated with the past because
we've now moved into this brave new world where we we have technical machines we don't need to
read literature and look at painting and listen to music and do drama and all these other things
or for goodness sake and develop some kind of spiritual sense of something beyond
you know that's if we're like that then that is it is a mass delusion which will lead to great
unhappiness conflict and and destruction the destruction of the valuable that's what i see
around me people at loggerheads much more than they were um 30 years ago interestingly the
relationships between all the societal groups that are now so strictly policed and and and
boundaryed and so on have become worse rather than better through this process so anyway there we are
okay thank you bonnie do you have a direct answer to that question or should we take some more questions
i think that um if you want to think of root causes or or the root problem i think it's one
of fragmentation in alienation at all scales so the the left hemisphere wants to analytically
reduce something to study it and so it feels fragmented and separated we feel that matter
is different than life in in a kind of alienated way we feel that humans are separate from nature
we feel individualistic we feel our countries are separate and sovereign so this whole notion
the i guess the left brain thinks it's separate from the right brain i would say that the lack
in loss of any kind of sense of understanding a deep continuity at all levels vertical and
vertical dimensions and horizontal dimensions could characterize the the sum total of the problem
okay thank you bonnie and i'd like to see a question from lisa maros maroski if i said that
correctly lisa you're welcome to ask it yourself but it could yeah there you go hi uh thank you
for hosting these wonderful talks i've really enjoyed them the context for my question
to to both of you is imagine is the imagination so i'm not really looking for a factual response
but given as you've said that the world is an organism and yet is being unmade
uh are there models such as uh the caterpillar becoming butterfly that uh barbremark's hubbert
refers to um that uh you know show us um or could help us understand what is happening
to us um help us get through this process of unmaking and remaking um and and then second to
that what might be we what might we be remade into like as the next phase of of evolution
um my my own hunch is that endosymbiosis might give us a clue um but not the answer
so so this is an imaginative question thank you very much and bonnie i know you might have
an angle on the butterfly uh caterpillar metaphor from a piece of writing that i'm familiar with
um ian if you have any thoughts initially
well um the the caterpillar butterfly flightings is is extraordinary in in nature and as we know
butterfly actually has a completely different genome from the caterpillar so what we're seeing
there is a transmogrification what um what i think i'm being asked to do is to say
what this butterfly is going to be like and um how we can bring about its release and and i
first of all what it what it is like i would be extremely cautious in predicting because i do
believe that one of the glories of existence is that things are not determined fully and that we
when we predict the future we are very often wrong so i i would resist being asked to make
any prediction about that i mean although i have my own hunches which are limited by my imagination
which are that probably some people will survive and will survive by leading much more simple
modest lives closer to nature and closer to one another than our human lives have become
um so i i i don't know quite how to exercise the imagination that you're asking me to exercise
except that i guess that my books are i hope works of imagination and that i appeal to many
great works of art and literature to illustrate my my drift but i i think i'm not entirely in
tune with the the drift behind that there's a little thrust behind that restaurant thank you ian
bonnie i want you to answer this because i know you've got a great take on this but
while i'm doing that if celeste flavan could put her hand up please because i want to take
your question but we can't find you um after this but bonnie first of all on uh caterpillar
what butterfly and what lies between yeah i'll start with that but i wanted to answer the
question also in a larger context so um we and i think this is a little bit building on what ian
said is that we can't we we shouldn't imagine that the caterpillar imagines itself to be a butterfly
it's much more scary than that right like if we if we had to voluntarily go through the
metamorphosis process without understanding it um that would truly be an act of imagination
um to be to be open and welcome and inviting surprise um but you said something beautiful
you talked about endo i think endo symbiosis and what i wanted to say is there's many places
where people are using their imaginations to thread a different story through the scientific facts
so ian uses scientific facts any any threads a beautiful story and other people can use the
same facts and they'll thread a different story um and so we need all all science is
based on what are called interaction metaphors they're deep metaphorical um assumptions about
the way things are and what we need are people who are uh understand the science
and using it to thread a different story um and so that actually separates i think imagination
from fantasy so that's that's one thing and the work on counterfactuals is very important so
you might say but what if what if the Darwinian attitude of the survival of the fittest
and complex adaptive systems is not true is there a story that threads the same evidence
that is more aligned with goodness truth and beauty so i've done that in writing speculative
philosophy on complex potential states it takes into account everything that the Darwinian attitude
takes into account but it tells a different story so endosymbiosis is one of those great
imaginative things that are emerging in our culture that want to be true to the science
but understand that there's a different story that can thread it and that's a power the
imagination the other thing i'm going to say that is something that i think is we should do i see
there's a question of education um there's something called empathic projection and kids
do it really well when they're young and that is they imagine what it might be like to be a pencil
and they imagine what it might be like to be an aunt and they imagine and in this experience
it's not like fantasy where you go away from the world you enter the spaces in between the world
that you don't understand and this is a valuable exercise in um in becoming attuned to the reality
of things and nature and animals so it's a process of the imagination it's called empathic projection
thank you bonnie i'm just going to get other questions in um celeste you're welcome to ask
it yourself if you're happy to do that i think we've found you now
can we hear you i'm not sure we can hear you i can see you but maybe your volume's not on or
what's the shall i just ask it for you or are you ready to go yeah okay thumbs up okay i can
ask it for you well thank you celeste it was really a question about poetry i'll i'll it's
to do with precision of language being a kind of antidote i'm going to get the exact wording here
but celeste asked here we go can language especially that which is used with extraordinary
deliberation and care i.e poetry be an antidote to this wide-scale delusion can we use the tool
that makes us feel tethered to our humanness to combat feelings of robotic or unintuitive
existence so you can already see the poet in the question um you know i'm assuming the answer
might be yes but what's the what's the sort of bigger answer it's very much yes i i would say
um and it's interesting this idea of the carefully considered uh or precise because of course
both here and in science there is this interplay between the the precise and the imaginative which
which means that although in science you're working with something that seems very
strict in its structure in fact the discoveries come through the exercise of intuition and
imagination there's just so many examples of this in the history of mathematics and science
and something similar could be said of course about poetry but what i was alerted to by your
question was the idea there's a certain sort of precision involved as well and that we need to be
precise as the situation will allow us to be but not a whit more than that in other words there is
a word that is precisely right because it opens itself to a number of possibilities being experienced
or felt at the same time so the great thing about poetic language is it's
ability to be single and multiple at once this is really a theme that should be throughout
everything we've talked about this evening that i feel at some point there was a tendency to say
that you know it's bad that there are individuals um but i'm sure that wasn't what was was was meant
by bonita um but but individuals are terrifically important what's important is that the distinction
and the um the differences don't imply a severance in fact they imply a something bigger out of which
they come and to which they contribute in turn so it's always this alliance of division with union
of the individuation with togetherness and integration and so i would say that poetry is an
example of this because in poetry we are trying to bring together not trying but allowing things
that are multiple to come together in our minds in a very clear and precise way that if you changed
a little bit of it would ruin it so it has a very individual existence but it arises from a process
which is unconscious and which is about the coming together of the many into the one
thank you ian bonnie there's don't have to add to that if you don't want to but you're welcome to
okay i am i know it's a beautiful answer but there's a lot of questions
thank you bonnie madalina machado uh great question you're welcome to ask it yourself or
give me a thumbs up if you're happy for me to ask it but you're welcome to you i'd rather you asked
it much rather you asked it you can do it yeah so you're on mute it now you're welcome to go ahead
well um i'm i'm actually quoting gregory baits and he says this question what have we here
um 400 plus people on a zoom call is this not radically new what sense does it make to speak
of what we've lost does this mostly apply to accidentals and a cosmo vision of domination
which is now eroding is it not about time we learn planetary interdependency for the first time
together as online ancestors because we're all online ancestors this is basically 10 years old
this duality of technology versus life is mannequistic nothing on this planet is not
natural there's nothing not natural as spinoza said the 24 years old 400 years ago with the
printing press we began propaganda propaganda pd the mr vatican now we are in a participatory age
for the first time ever can we give ourselves permission not to know and honestly this is what
i feel bonita is teaching at the pop-up school which i've joined and it has for me for example
just add one little footnote in the 2p language in the amazon there's no word for sin there's
no word for temptation there's no word for kingdom i mean what would our language be
language in had those concepts not you know abducted our capacity to think differently
thank you well well i would love to ask you some questions medelina another time maybe
but for now ian do you want to respond to that
um bonnie you ian if you want to pause for some thought bonnie do you have a more immediate
response yeah because i i think it ties into the previous question on poesis so she so medelina
is saying what would our language be like and i think um you know there's po poetic language
is a contemplation on ideas or things that language seems to contradict right so how can
everything already be nature and is nature then destroying itself is nature unmaking the world
is like the question if everything's nature then isn't this just make nature unmaking the world
and i think this kind of tension if you sit with it in a certain way so you have both trust and doubt
and belief and skepticism and confidence in the in the intellect the intelligence of the world
and humility then something like poetry comes out and we might imagine that that's something
that shares with earlier languages so i would say that that's that's how it seemed to me that as
the question came up right after the last question ian i wasn't really quite sure what the question
was i i heard that we that we were in a more positive way we could communicate with one another
and so on then there was a sudden remark about the word sin which by the way not only in the
two pay language but also across many parts of the world there isn't such a word um but what am i supposed
to okay if i if i dare give my own interpretation the reason i chose medallina's question
it it actually it was it reminded me of a colleague and friend idra adnan who was on a
zoom call a bit like this one with several hundred people from across the world and one of the
speakers was lamenting how disconnected we all are all were how we've lost connection with each
other and she's saying what the hell are you talking about look at this extraordinary process
that we're part of who knows where this might lead this is the beginning of something amazing
and we should all get over ourselves and stop complaining and start using the technology we
have to you know reckon with the no doubt profound problems we have um but also to trust
that something is emerging that's of great value and promise and and as i understand
medallina's question i think she's just using that as a counterweight to the sense that the
things are inevitably collapsing something is also arising that that is right and if we could
find a way of using the interconnecting capacity sparingly when it is really important and not
allowing all the dross that comes with it to drown out the good then that would be a marvelous thing
but i remember when i went to johns hopkins in in 1922 um 1922 1992 i'm not that in 1992
we were i was in a in a in a lab um looking at scans uh of brains and the head of the department
came in and said you guys are great you know work you're doing is great but you know what we need
is more communication and i was already aware that in england started this sort of over communicative
style and in america it was already a huge problem people spent so much time um recording
communicating and so on that the actual business of what they were doing got somehow left behind
and i said actually what we need is to communicate less but to communicate when it's really important
so i do think this is i'm not saying this just to be sort of a bit flippant um there is a huge
problem with what technology is doing to our attention it is it is fighting for our attention
which has been monetized and destroying our attention is destroying our intelligence
destroying our capacity to imagine it is degrading at the level of our experience and the being so
this is a worry to me i i love the fact that we're all here on this call and so it's best to
focus on the good bits and um but but there are mighty problems as well and and in and also i'd
just like to say in the way that the coincidence of opposites works is that if there is too much
cacophony and too much actually people fall out with one another and don't actually become closer
to one another it's a really difficult one to to call that life is complex it's not just a simple
question of there being more or less communication what is the quality of that communication is a
very important question can i just follow up i think i think to put it short i think um i think
communication like this is neither necessary nor sufficient for to to stop the unmaking of the world
and so when but it can be helpful or it can be harmful but to think that it's either necessary
or sufficient i think is is both of those are a mistake um and i agree with ian the the the
cost in general is currently out outweighing the benefit the new the new chipper non heracliton
ian says um well it's it's not um uh sufficient but it might might be necessary to have these sorts
of conversations i hope so technology technology yeah okay well i i i do like the i do like the
chipper ian as you know um listen um there were i can i encourage everyone here to please take a
look at the chat um because there are some mind-blowingly good questions in there and i'm
really very grateful for all of them um back in the day when i worked at the rsa i um i chaired
quite a lot of events and before i started doing that matthew taylor who was the chief executive at
the time taught me that it's always better to end an event leaving people wanting more rather than
drag on with further questions even though there are great questions to come so i'm going to leave
leave you with that thought and end now um i'm very grateful for all the questions that haven't
been uh aired but they are there in the chat you can write them down we will take note of them they
may come up again i notice some about education about parenting about love great stuff there will
be more there will be another of these events um in two weeks and another two weeks after that and
another two weeks after that watch this space for more information um there's also a connection in
inquiry session as i say um those of those of you on this event will now be signed up the
perspective as mailing list so you will hear from us about all of those things very shortly
um but i really want to just thank you all for being there it's been a great attendance
and some lovely questions um and i'm very well particularly grateful to bonita roy for beaming
in from connecticut to ian gilchrist of course for beaming in from sky um and i just want to thank
you all for coming and i hope you'll come back and bring your friends so uh with that thoughts
enjoy the rest of your day or evening and see you again soon take care thank you
