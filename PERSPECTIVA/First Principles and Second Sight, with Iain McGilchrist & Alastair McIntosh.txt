Well, welcome everyone. It's lovely to see so many people from all around the world and
it's really an enormous pleasure to introduce tonight's speakers. I am keen to get out of
the way as quick as I can tonight, not to steal their time. Just briefly to say who
we are and what the context of this event. Perspectiva recently celebrated its seventh
birthday. We're a charity based in London and we play with our elevator pitches and
they change over the years. But the essence of it is that we're interested in the relationship
between three kinds of world. The inner world of the human being, the psyche, the soul,
the spirit is very important to us. We see it as something sort of culturally neglected,
something we need to understand better. But we also want to have that in conversation
with complex systems at scale, the economy, politics, technology and so on. And we're
interested in how all of this plays out in society and contexts like this when we're
trying to navigate together what's going on and make sense of the world. So our tagline
is systems, souls and society as a way of covering the kinds of relationship we're
trying to make sense of. And that's reflected in our public conversations like this one.
But we're also a publisher and although we won't announce all the details now, we do
have some very good news about a significant ramping up of our publishing arm next year
based on a grant that we earned in this year just passed. So watch the space for further
perspective of books to explore these themes in greater detail. And we also can announce
that in June we have the Realization Festival Perspectiva or co-founders of that with St
Giles House. That's right at the end of June. And we have already confirmed to Speaker
Ron Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. And there are other things to share. We have
a Perspectiva community you can find online. And we do have a sub-stack if you're interested
in our writing and we publish ourselves but also bringing other people to share the space
with us. So do check out Perspectiva sub-stack. And if you want to support us as a charity,
not least at Christmas, do consider becoming a paid subscriber. That really helps a lot.
So, well, Ian and Alastair are people I know personally. But let me just share who they
are to the outside world. First of all, Ian is, I think, one of not many people who can
reasonably be called polymath. And he has a background as a literary scholar and not
just, you know, read a few books but actually taught literature for seven odd years, I believe.
So a really deep grounding in the humanities subsequently became more interested in science
for a period of time and later became a neuropsychiatrist, to put it technically correct, I think.
And that led to, over the years, to him realizing one big thing, one really big idea that I've
jokingly called the McGillchrist Maneuver, but it's based on the hemispheric hypothesis,
an understanding of the different hemispheres of the brain, not so much what they do but
how they are and what follows for how they attend to the world and the world that's brought
into being as a result and everything that follows from that. And we're very, very proud
to publish this book The Matter of Things. If you don't have it already, it's a mammoth
two-volume book but very highly recommended and I hope tonight's event at least doesn't
discourage you from buying it and hopefully, you know, sends you on your way.
Here is, well, I know him most recently as someone who took my son's fishing and I share
that with all candor because it gets to the heart of the man, I think. He wanted them,
younger generation, he knew they were coming through Scotland, we were not so far away.
He wanted to show them where the food came from, took them out on his boat. The delight
in my son's was off the charts and it's a sort of testament to Alastair's grounded
spirituality that he's very much interested in questions of meaning and purpose and the
sacred but at the same time extremely earthbound giving a great deal of his time, energy and
attention and brilliant mind to significant issues of land reform and protecting those
who can't always protect themselves, speaking up for those who are in poverty and fighting
on their behalf. So an extraordinary mind and heart and it's really an enormous pleasure
to bring these two wonderful people together. And tonight, we are technically part of the
series, Attention as a Moral Act, which is now the ninth chapter of that. However, I've given
complete permission, not that they needed it, to speak about whatever they wanted to and I know
that over the last few days, since we decided on this event quite last minute, only about a week
ago, there's been some sending of books across Scotland for both parties and they're both
studying each other's work. So I want to leave it to them to follow the conversation. The title is
First Principles and Second Sight and I'll leave it to them to decide where to go with that.
And whoever feels most moved to speak first, you're welcome to do so. I will join you again
in about an hour. Take care and forward to listening. Over to you, Alastair and Ian.
Here we are. Here we are at last, which is wonderful. And you've got a... I'm drinking the
Fine Talisker, but I think you're drinking a little-known whiskey called the Hera.
I wouldn't say we're allowed to do this. But my daughter, who is a clinical new
psychologist, you might be interested to know, she sent me a bottle of the Hera,
which is one that is unique to Houston House. So I will have a small drop of this while we're
talking. Yes, let's not go wild.
To raise a question to yourself.
Very much to you, Alissa, and to our listeners too. So I wanted to... I mean, I didn't make this
title. I think Jonathan did. But it occurred to me as I was reading your work that it had
something quite interesting to say about the Scottish mind. Because in your book, I found that
you quoted, I can't remember the name of the man, Pharah, who said that there was a Caledonian
Antisigie. Which is a lovely word. Cisigie means a coincidence of opposites. And he could have
got away with that, really. But there is something about the Scots that is puzzling. You know, my
dad was a Scot. And he was a very down-to-earth sort of Scot. And he said, the thing about the
Scots is they're very hard-working. They're very precise. They're very down-to-earth. They make
great engineers and doctors and so on. And yes, that's true in a way. But there's another completely
different side to the Scots, isn't there? And that's the bit that encompasses second sight. So
they do nice to do this split. And it occurred to me, perhaps you'd like to pick me up on this or
not. But there's something here that reminds me of my feeling about the Germans. That they're both,
you know, magnificently precise and make very good engineers. But they're also,
they were really the first romantic. Well, what a way to plunge in. If I might say,
first of all, for people who don't know your book in double volumes, I mean, look at the
sickness of that nearly 1600 pages of that with things. You're deeply wrestling with that problem
as a philosopher. I'm not coming at it as a philosopher. I'm coming at it more from a poetic
perspective and a culturally rounded perspective, an experiential perspective.
What you were doing in these 1600 pages, which I should say, I've only skimmed,
I've only had it for a couple of days, I've just skimmed it. You're very badly behaved because
there are some chapters to which you gave no conclusions. I had to presume that they are
inconclusive. I only gave conclusions to the first part because it's science. And I wanted
people who weren't comfortable with the science just to get the drift. What you're doing is you're
putting so many strands together. You're coming at it from a neuropsychiatric basis, which is
fascinating. You're also going into the philosophy of time and into wave motion,
physics, the whole shebang. And you're doing so in a way that gives a wonderful grounding
in these disciplinary areas for people who haven't got it. So the person who came to mind,
as I was reading you, was Clarence Glacken, traces on the Rhodian shore. When I was a student at
Aberdeen in our first year geography classes, that was one of the set books. And it's often
been remarked that Glacken, who said that it was when the shipwrecked soldiers came ashore on roads,
and he saw geometric patterns on the sand, knew that this must be a sign that there were human
beings here. Because who else could make geometric patterns on the sand? And it's often been said
that Glacken was one of the last of the scholars who could really pull together an immense inter-disciplinary
perspective and bring it to bear in the matters of the world. And that, it seems to me, he wasn't
the last, but you're doing that here. I hugely congratulate you for what you were doing. But
you asked me there about the Caledonian anti-systhegy, A-T-I-S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y anti-systhegy. It's a philosophy
as gift to Scrabble. And basically, this was an idea that Professor G. Gregory Smith came up with
in his book, Scottish Literature, published in 1919, in which he said there were two moods
in the Scottish psyche. On the one hand, as your father just said, there is the engineer,
the mathematician, the accountant. On the other hand, there is this crazy world, as he puts it,
where you are tossed in the horns of Earthland, the imaginal world. And I think in many respects,
what he is describing there is what you describe when you speak of the left and right hemisphere.
The left hemisphere, the mechanic, the engineer, the doctor, etc. The right hemisphere, the
artists, the musician, the one who is away with the fairies.
You could see it that way. But of course, as you and I know, the fairies are not to be taken lightly.
So that it's not a matter of being somehow scooped up into some unrealistic fantasy.
I believe that there's something in the Scottish psyche, and I have, and you have,
more than I have because you grew up here, but I know stories of and have had some experiences
of people making unbelievably unlikely prophecies that turned out to be entirely true.
They were able to see things here, and my partner is of Scottish descent, and she has her head screwed
on. Don't think otherwise, but she has the most amazing capacity for a second sight,
which she takes very much in her stride. But it is something that is very real, I think, and we
only don't recognize it because if you stop believing in something and stop attending to it,
you don't see it anymore. The faculty for seeing it withers, and you don't, you can't do it anymore.
And we need to ask, why is this important? Because here we are, you know, we've got 500 or
people on here just now, and we're diving straight into the fairies and the second site,
which most philosophers would not take incredibly. You know, most philosophers would think we are
off the wall of this, and why are we taking it so importantly? That we're talking about
first principles and second sight. We're talking here about epistemology. In the warm-up here,
I sent you that, you know, right beside me here, I didn't have plan this, it's just on the shelf.
I have the Institute of Metaphysics by the Professor of Moral Philosophy at St Andrews University.
He was writing this in, say, was it 1875, and Perrier invented the word epistemology,
which is about the theory of what knowledge is and how knowledge is structured. How do we know
what we think we know? What is the meaning that gives meaning to meaning? Is there any sense in
what we say, these kind of questions? And we're diving straight into the second site here.
You're speaking to me from Taliske House in Sky. I have here, this was planned, a book
recently published in Sky by Steve Taylor, the seer, Visions, Dreams and Prophecy, Isle of Sky
and the Hebrides. Now, I know two of the now deceased seers, or I knew two of them in here,
two of them are good friends of mine, Norman MacLeod at Bridgehouse in Harris and Tawkel McClay
of Grimshadow, the next village to me in the Isle of Lewis. So I've sat with these people
and had first hand accounts of their seership. Why does this matter? Because if we are concerned
with first principles, what is real? What is reality? Anomalous phenomena, like these telepathic
clairvoyant type precognitive phenomena, are of huge importance. And they may not appear to
so to many of the people listening to us just now, because of how they might be situated culturally.
But as you've already indicated Ian, if you are living in an indigenous culture, such as those
of the Hebrides, then you cannot not be aware of it. You cannot not be aware. And so you've got
to factor this, you can either deny your own culture, and indeed as you've just indicated,
deny your own reality. Or, well then you're in a state of denial. We're talking about very,
really, when I was 18, I had failed my first year of physics at Aberdeen University. I had to
resit it, and sitting there, swatting in my father's, well, surgery, because the doctor's house and
the surgery were united then. So I'm sitting in, you know, in our surgery house at Glenmore,
in North Loxon, Lewis. And my father was ill. He was away in Rakemore. He was in hospital there.
And my mother had driven off from the car to go to Stornoway, seven miles away. She went there
nearly every day. This was not unusual. And she was going to go and fly over to
Inverness and visit him in Rakemore. And about 10 minutes after she'd left, there's me sitting
studying my physics texts. And I look up, only to see my father's beloved whippet dog,
Sheba, who he had rescued from abuse. Jump up out of the ditch, run at first the road, and smack
into a passing fan and killed outright. I ran out. I told the driver, I'd seen it. There was
nothing he could do just to drive on. And I did what any rural child would have done in that age.
I went to the buyer, the cow shed. I got a hessian sack and a spade, placed Sheba's limp
body into it, and walked out to the moor to dig a hole and start burying her.
And I would say, although I was 18, I psychologically regressed. I needed my
mother to be there so that she could tell my father, because this was before, this was 1976,
summer of 1974, the summer of 1974. I needed my mother to be there
so that she could pass the news because she couldn't just pick up a mobile phone and tell
my dad in a hospital in those days. And I'd no sooner got the whole dog. When my mother's car
reappeared at high speed over the brow of the hill, I ran towards it. She screeched to a halt.
She got out looking white as a ghost and shouted at me, what's the matter?
I said, the dog's dead. She said, thank goodness, I thought it might have been a child. She thought
it might have been me or my sister. She doubled back, managed to catch the plane to Inverness,
got into rake moor, said to my dad in his hospital bed, Ian, I've got bad news for you.
I know he said it's Sheba, isn't it? How did you know she said? He said, because
all last night I kept on being woken up by Sheba jumping up on my bed and pouring me.
Now, Ian, when I tell that story in Lewis, or if you told that story in Sky, people would tell you
another couple of stories just like it, quite likely some time they'd experience themselves.
And this is where what you're writing about time, you culminating with what is it, 114 pages
of something chapter on the sacred is so important because you're opening the ground for these things.
Well, I see them as separate, really, but connected, if you know what I mean.
I have very little experience of paranormal phenomena directly. But I am quite clear that
there is a realm of the sacred, and it is that that perhaps this in some ways bridges
in many people's lives. I mean, I sometimes say whenever original people in Australia say that
they can hear the voices of ancestors, that they can see things happening hundreds of miles away,
which turn out to be true, who are we to say that they can't do these things? And again,
I think it's atrophy of a faculty which we have taught ourselves not to use. Richard Dawkins,
a man of whom you've no doubt heard, has a dogma that children wouldn't normally think in terms of
anything to do with the sacred or the religious or particularly the paranormal, except it was
drummed into them by our culture. But the reality, which is, you know, I quote the scientific evidence
for this is that children, when they're little, automatically do think in these terms, and they
only stop doing when they go to school and find that it's no longer considered smart to talk like
that. So I think that's interesting. And a couple of other things that care to me. One is that you
in sending our initial exchange of emails, you won't mind my mentioning that you said that
Johnson and Boswell, when they were up here, sort of mocked this. And I don't remember that at all.
In fact, I thought it was rather the opposite, that they had exactly the cast of mind that a proper
scientific person should have, which is open, there may be something here, and they would be
interested in hearing more, but they weren't sure. And they certainly weren't dismissive.
And they were very impressed by the stories that they heard. One story that I can tell, but then
perhaps we can move on from second sight to more to do with the more general sense of the sacred,
is, well, there are some things that are a bit too personal to mention, but they're absolutely
riveting. But one is from my partner, who was at the opera in London, I think with her husband,
and saw a friend that she knew who was in France, who was there and said, what are you doing here?
And I don't remember the rest of the conversation. But the next day she got news from France that
he had died. And I mean, she's not my partner, given to seeing things as it were, or I mean,
she's a very, very rational, down to earth person. And I find that people who have this faculty
don't make a big thing out of it. They take it along with that rationality. And I wish we were
able to have this balanced way, this scissorgy of these two things, which complement one another.
I remember in also reading something I just want to mention, that you told in part of your book
about, I think you had a bus of 18 archaeologists and engineers you brought from
Glasgow, Edinburgh, I forget where, and you were in the tropics, I think, I mean, you've got this
wrong. And there was a big question with a last about going out at a certain time, because this
was the fairest time, the twilight, the gloaming. And you went to a sheen, which is a kind of holy
place for where you see fairies. And you were there in your sleeping bag, and you looked out and you
saw, well, you should perhaps tell it, but you saw this disc of lights that was close to the ground,
and was coming down the path, it was moving along the path as though it were sort of walking almost,
and came to you and went back into the sheen. So I thought that was, let me say, at least very
interesting, and not to be just dismissed. Well, I've had your two or three experiences like that,
which I've written about at various points, you're talking about my book, Portia's Pilgrimage there,
which is a book where I really go into the nature of the spiritual and the spiritual embodied in
the land. And what interests me about it is that this opens us up to the nature of imagination,
and the question that I address in Portia's Pilgrimage, do we merely have imaginations,
or are we moving in imagination? Are we moving in cosmic imagination? And this is where you're
writing, where you open a pathway to profound interconnectedness in your analysis of time,
and how it interacts with how you see the right hemisphere of the brain, is very relevant.
Why does this matter? It matters because it's about our relationality together,
it raises the question whether we're parts of one another.
Yes, and when you have time to read my book, if you ever have time to read my book at Greater
Lank, you'll see that one of my grounding, in fact, probably the central message, is that everything
exists in relation, that relations are prior to the things that are related, which is why there
was a problem with things, because things are secondary to the relations that they exist in,
the network that they exist in. So I very much agree with that. And I think the important point
about imagination is one that you make using, I think, a now customer distinction between the
imaginary and the imaginal. But I would say that there is nothing fantastic about the imagination.
Wordsworth and Coleridge, two very important figures for me intellectually,
made the big distinction between fantasy and imagination. And fantasy takes you away from
reality, but imagination takes you into the depth of reality, so that you really see it.
And I think what you're seeing, and what you're describing in Lewis, is that meaning of the
word imagination, not a fantasy world, but a world more real than the one we imagined is the only
real one. Yeah, I'm thinking here, I recently read Henri Corbaill's work, Alone is Alone. So he was
a great French Islamist, and he's writing about the scholar Ibn Arabi. And he has this wonderful
line that prayer is the supreme act of the creative imagination. Yes, I love that.
Creative and he capitalizes creative imagination. That we pray to God, or pray for God, God
prays for us, all in a oneness. But before we dig into that further, can I ask you the question
that fascinates me, because I spent a number of hours with your books, giving it, as I say.
But I kept on wondering, what is motivating you here? Because you've reached the top of your
career in conventional neuropsychiatric terms and so on. You're clearly well positioned as a
philosopher. And yet the longest chapter in your book, over 100 pages, ends up being under the
sacred, which is risky ground. What is motivating you? What experiences have you had that opens
you to the importance of this? Well, I don't know. I mean, I can describe experiences, but really,
I think what motivates me is something rather unusual and probably prejudicial to a career,
which is the truth. I mean, it sounds grand to say that. But I think the thing that we have most
importantly lost in our lives is any sense of truth. We now believe and say the most absurd
things that have ever been said by moderately intelligent human beings, we have lost track of
truth. Even in science, we are now being constrained by all kinds of things. You can't say this, you
mustn't do that. We are losing truth. And I wanted to be truthful to the reality. I was trying to
get that. This is my life's work, this book. And I was begged by philosophers who read my book,
not to write a chapter on the sacred, because he said the philosophy in these books is very
interesting. And it can be taken seriously. But if you write about the sacred, nobody will take
it seriously. And yet in many ways, what I'm writing about leads rationally to, I wanted to
take people who couldn't countenance any idea of the sacred or the divine, perfectly reasonable
position for many people nowadays, take them by the hand and show them things that are scientific
and that are reasonable, and bring them by stages to a place where they could accept it or see it.
And one of the things I feel very much about this kind of neck of the woods is something
I can't put my finger on to do with the sacred, whether or not one sees it as specifically to
do with a religion or not is another matter. But in the very natural world here, which called to
me to come and live here, is something very, very special. People who come here say there is something,
there is a new man, there is a feeling, there is, I don't know what they call it, but there's a sort
of something that speaks. And I think that, and you can't deny that, I think, unless you willfully
blot it out. And I often ask myself the question, perhaps you can reflect a bit on this, why did
those Celtic saints have to come so far to find peace and solitude? After all, in those days,
it was before EasyJet, you didn't have to go too far from Londinium a few miles to find total
peace and seclusion. So what drove them through wildness, through adverse climate, through taking
their precious books on little coracles across the water, pushing on and on towards the outer rim
of the known world? What were they doing? Well, Sinterdam, in his biography of St Columba,
written a century after Columba's death, around about 697, I think it was, he testifies to that,
he testifies to people coming from far and wide to go out in small books and find little scaries,
little rocks in the sea, where they could sit and be alone with God and nature and pray for the world.
You said about coming to telescope where you are just now, and I would imagine it's probably a
glass of telescope whiskey that you've got, with your written off, you'll certainly have it in your
cupboard. What else could it be? I actually did a naughty little bit of homework here,
because I dug out a poem by the Isle of Rassy poet, Sorley McClain, Samuel McClain.
I mean, talk about deep ecology. I dug out one of Sorley's poems called Tion Beaches.
It's from his poems for Emma, who is the wife of Coo-Hulan, his mythical muse, his figure of love.
And I just need to explain some place meanings here, telescope meaning the sloping rock,
at the north, coming into the garlic there, who are, and Clash, the story point.
I know the bit you're going to read. It's so wonderful. The reddish rocks, the picture being
painted here is of the sloping rock, and then down on the sea, these two rocks, and beside them,
there's the white sea churning in. Now listen to this, you know what I'm going to read, but the folk
listening to us don't. Wonderful lines, but only read the first standard, because we haven't got time
for the whole poem. Don't worry, it's already a short bit, and pre-Charlie, is that how you
pronounce it, pre-Charlie? A rock that looks like an animal here. If we were in telescope on the shore
where the great white mouth opens between two hard jaws, ruin and Clash, and the bitter ruin,
where I would stand beside the sea, renewing love in my spirit, while the ocean was filling
telescope bay forever, I would stand there on the bareness of the shore, until Prishul bowed
his stallion head, until the rocks are worn away. That is the place where you're living,
that is the integration of people, poetry, and nature. It's mind-blowingly beautiful,
I mean the poem, we mustn't give the impression the place is, otherwise the place will be over
on the tourists, which we could never do, but you know the other thing that I think is very relevant
is that haunting line with which he begins a poem about Haleik, the ruined village there,
and it begins, time the deer is in the woods, wood of Haleik, and the interesting thing is I
hadn't really picked up until reading you actually, that the word deer and wild are one and the same
in Fia, meaning the wildness and the deer, and the deer, you know here I am, I'm sitting underneath
the fairy on the Christmas tree, and I'm sitting at the foot of the sheen, the fairy tale as I
talk to you, metaphorically speaking, and the deer is a cattle of the fairies, and you know
Dr John McKinnis, there's Michael Newton's book of him, oh too high up, you know in his essay on
the supernatural in the Gaelic world he says that fairy is a metaphor for the imagination, so in other
words fairy is an indigenous way of talking about what you call my hemisphere. Well it's being open
to whatever is, listening and being honouring of, whatever comes to you, not constantly saying but
I know better, it's like this, I already know this, I'm going to put it in my box of knowledge,
and it's getting away from that, that is in our world so difficult, it's getting back to all that
is meant by Jung's unconscious mind in which there are powerful symbols, and the thing about them is
that once they're made explicit, they lose their power, so it's a deeply implicit, unexplicit
knowledge, and that is why it will always seem lacking or fantastic to somebody who's determined
to dismiss it, and as Johnson himself said, for those who want to be skeptical there are many
reasons and he lists them, but he also beautifully says that there are other reasons for standing
back from that position as well, he was so wonderfully unpredictable man, he was in fact in
some ways the first romantic, the first appreciator of Shakespeare, and he was also a rational thinker,
a very down-to-earth man, he managed to bridge these worlds we're talking about, and I'm honored
that he came and stayed in my house, and there's not many people who can say...
I know, two nights in your house!
He did, and he just slept in what was then called the Low Bedroom, which is now my library, and as I
say, not many people can say that Dr. Johnson slept in the library.
So you put me right in that, because I had picked up that Johnson was a bit incredulous, and what
he says basically is that some people are incredulous about it, but as you rightly
corrected me, he himself was very open to what he was saying there, and to his reflection on
Martin Martin, who wrote about 40 pages on the second site. Can we take this to a slightly
different level, because one of the feelings that I had reading or skimming your book Ian,
is that it was as if there was a gradually sloping swimming pool going into unfathomably deep
water at the deep end, and you were taking your reader in each of your chapters by the hand,
and leading them round to the deep end, and saying this is actually real.
This is where you swim.
This is where you swim. This is where you learn to die. This is where you even perhaps learn to
breathe underwater. Is that...
Thank you for saying that. That's exactly what I hoped. I'm delighted and thrilled that you feel
that, but I feel that you're taking people to the same place just by a different means, a more
narrative and more poetic means. After all, one of the things that is so central to your work,
I mean the title, Soil and Soul itself tells us, is this link, two links really. One is between
the earth and whatever is above and beyond it, and the other is to the sense of the place,
the importance of place, and that's something we've been taught no longer to feel, an allegiance
to a place. It's not fashionable. It doesn't fit with the post-industrialized society where we
were all uprooted and taken away from our culture and thrown into a hug-a-mugger world in a city
where we had to reinvent meaning, because those meanings had been left behind deep in the places
that we came from. And you know, one of the things that staggered me when I was writing The Master and
His Emistry was to discover that animals such as rats bond as much with their nest as they do
with their mother. So their nest is like their mother. I mean that's pretty important, and your
work unveils this what's there in this landscape. I found myself, and you mentioned this concept
which I hadn't heard of, I'll get the pronunciation probably wrong. Is it Keanna Las? Keanna Las, yes,
a deep yearning, a kind of homesickness for place, a yearning, a longing for your place of belonging.
And you know all the cultures that have not been uprooted and deracinated and thrown around the
world have this feeling, and it's not just a useful yearning. It's a sense of connection, a longing
which literally means a stretching out of yourself from some place that you wish to be
close to again. C.F. Lewis writes very well about this. Well you know from Soil and Soil that my
best known work is just land reform, and my involvement in the 1990s was the organisation
that brought egg, and I mean you will look out your window. Can you see egg from where you are?
C.F. Lewis Not, no, it's from the other end of the island, but I can. C.F. Lewis You've probably
got rum, but the mountains have rum just blocking. C.F. Lewis You can see rum,
you can see rum if you're up on the heights. C.F. Lewis You can see rum if you're up on the
heights. C.F. Lewis Just behind, just behind. C.F. Lewis I know, yes. C.F. Lewis And so to me,
I suppose having grown up in the Isle of Lewis, and having experienced real life communities of
place, and then as a young man when I was 22, being sent by voluntary service overseas to
Papua New Guinea, and finding exactly the same cultural understanding of community in Papua
New Guinea, as we had in Lewis, to the extent it helped me understand my own home place properly,
for the first time. You know, you don't, fish doesn't see the water, it steps into a different
water. That experience opened me to this work with people in place, which I think is germane
to our modern environmental predicament, that we have become de-racinated, or as Anthony Gooden's
sociologist puts it, disembedded from the place of our embeddedness. And so one of the practical
applications of the kind of work I'm doing, and that you're doing, is the ways in which it can
help to re-embed us. C.F. Lewis We need to be re-embedded. We need seriously to be re-embedded
in place and in time. These are the two things that are most important in where we are in this
world. And I don't mean that they should confine us, but in fact they liberate us into this other
world that we're talking about. It's through them that we find the greater, the eternal, the whatever.
We don't do it by turning our backs on place and time, but by inhabiting them. And it's the
continuity of time, i.e. those who came before us, and those who will come after us, and the
continuity of place that have been disrupted for us, and have made us, I don't know what to say,
pilgrims wanderers, people who are fleeing from their own being. C.F. Lewis The fairy on top of my
three hands me down, just the very book, and you know, here's the latest time is. And there is a
wonderful line early on in the time is where Socrates, as it is, defines time as being a moving
image of eternity, a moving image of eternity. And when I first read that at the age of 20,
early 20s, it kind of blew my mind because it is so much the sense of time that you get
in Hebridean religious people. We're talking here of free church, free church of Scotland,
those sort of people that are the indigenous people of the communities.
Earlier, I mentioned the retired policeman now passed away, Norman the Cloud of Bridgehouse
of Harris, and he wrote, I put it on my single page of notes for tonight, so I could quote him
exactly. But I've got him quoted in Porteous Pilgrimage, where I discussed my meeting with him,
in which he's describing to me the vision, the second site vision he had of events in the
Falkland war several weeks before they happened. And eventually, he was so afflicted with the
second site, that he prayed to God to have it taken away from him. And as Steve Taylor in this
book that I mentioned here, there's got a whole chapter on Norman says, and indeed, as Norman's
own daughter told me, when she came to a talk I gave in Van Bekula a few years ago, that was
successful. He was then relieved of the predicament of seeing what was going to happen to people
before it happened. But Norman said to me, isn't it interesting, isn't it? Because Norman said to
me, he was criticizing a book by Ludwig Kennedy, in which... Oh yes, yes, I read that bit, yes, yes,
yes. But carry on, yes, yes. And you know, Kennedy was poo-hooing the idea of God. Yes, yes.
And this is what Norman said to me. He said, my God, Alastair, it's a high and lofty one who
inhabits us eternally. His name is holy. Now there you have hepody and metaphysical religion
who inhabits us eternally. I mean, it's all there, really, in that. And this sense of, you know,
these things that are double-edged slightly, the high and mighty, the awe-inspiring,
and the thing that can also inspire melancholy, or key analyst, or how we pronounce it,
key analyst. That seems absolutely core to the feeling one has here of
contacting something very profound and without the sort of tinge of the melancholy or whatever,
there wouldn't be the depths of it. And I'm wondering if you and I both, it turns out,
as I discover, as far as I can tell anyway from my brief reading of you, that we both
embrace panentheism, not pantheism. And the important, you pointed out in what you had
to say about that, I have things to say about it in my work, but you pointed out that in some ways
that perhaps explains how so much that seems to our eyes to be painful, destructive, whatever,
is also taken up into the realm that has meaning, that has ultimate meaning. And I think that is
a way I would very much embrace with you. Yeah. This is why hepody and people,
for those who don't know what the hebrides are, islands like Skye, where Ian is speaking from,
and the Isle of Lewis, where I grew up and had my primary connections with.
Hepody and people have really experienced hardship in the past. They've had, you know,
in an extreme environment, terrible losses in the first and second world war, because there were
such competent mariners and practical people. Sorry about that, Ian. It looks like we've just
lost Alastair. He might be trying to come back on in. I might ask Jonathan if he wants to step in.
Well, yes, yes. I was hoping to talk about some other things with the...
Don't worry. He'll be back. He'll be back. Yeah, yeah. I'll play temporary substitute.
I was struck there for a second. I know this is not literally what Alastair said, but it sounded
awfully like for a minute he was saying the right hemisphere is a fairy. But I want, just for a
second there was, you know, were you really saying that? No. I'm not saying that. I know you're not
saying that. I know everyone listening knows you're not saying that. I guess we keep an eye out for
him entering the room up there. Yes, yes, of course. What I was curious to understand the
re-inventor was what not everyone watching may know, and even Alastair, because he hasn't had
so much time with the books yet, may not know, in the second volume of the matter with things,
although the sacred comes right at the end, it doesn't come out. There is a sort of cumulative
argument that includes rethinking many metaphysical principles from the nature of time, the perception
of value, sort of cosmological purpose, the nature of the world and so on. Can you talk us
through just a little bit what that story is, how you end up with the sacred, and a lot of people
want to go straight there, but I feel in some ways even interesting is how you bridge the scientific
premise to fill that out towards the sacred. I suppose it offers two things. One is it shows
that it's not disconnected from, but actually consequent on. Hello, Alastair, and I'll just
finish answering Jonathan's question, but consequent on a reimagining which we must
make in any case of what we think our reality to be. And I suppose the other thing is that it offers
a way of bringing people who might not be entirely close to the possibility of the divine, but don't
as yet experience it to coming to a place where they can find something that resonates. So that's
really it. I will take my leave again momentarily, but just to say that part of the book, the first
phase of the second volume for me is my favorite part, just for those who are watching who are
interested. I can disappear for a second to let them carry on for another 10 minutes or so.
Alastair, I wanted to ask you, unless you have something pressing, but I wanted to use the bitter
time we've got left to talk about wildness. I don't know if you like the poem by Gerald
Mandy Hopkins, but he wrote wonderfully about wildness and wilderness and how important it is
to us. And I don't think we understand this. We think that as long as there is land, it's okay,
but it being wild, untamed, undominated by the human spirit is very, very important. And there's
almost nowhere left in these islands where this is true. There are bits of sky and bits of the
outer hebrides. And you probably know something that really I think is so awful that everybody
watching this should write to their MPs or raise it in public, is that a Danish company who have
bought parts of sky are going to erect enormous wind farms on sky, dethroning the last really great
place of wildness in this part of the world, or one of them anyway. And this is a crime. It's not
something that any human being should be contemplating. If it costs more to put them in the
sea, then do so. Or it might even mean that we become less dependent on electricity altogether.
But to destroy the beauty of these wild places is an unforgivable sin in my view. I feel very
strongly about this and probably tell. Well, am I back on? Can I just say that what company officer
is that, although I had my phone supposedly switched off, so somebody who's able to get through,
ironically, who is from the Isle of Harris, one of the men in the Galgale Trust, a local
organisation here in Government, who wrestles profoundly with alcohol, with ill health, a wonderful
man, a wonderful man, who burst into garlic song at a moment's notice. So that was the Isle of
Harris. It was calling. The second site. Well, I don't know. I hope it doesn't come on again and
fool me off. Can I engage your considerable prestige, imagination and energy in helping us fend off
this disaster? Or perhaps it's too late, but it is really. Okay. So basically, my view is that
terrestrial wind farms, as distinct from one's far out to sea, should only be where the local
community decides that it wants to have them under its control for its benefit. Like you have the
Point and Sandwick Trust in the Isle of Lewis, putting a million pounds a year into the community,
whereas if it were the commercial one, it would only get 45,000 pounds a year or something like
that. So that is my position on wind farms. The situation we're caught in just now is that the
urban world is saying, well, we need to get carbon-free energy. So we'll go to places like
the Highlands and Islands. We're not going to have it from nuclear. So we'll go to places
like the Highlands and Islands and we'll wire it down from there. And the problem I have with
that, Ian, is that if you destroy the beauty of nature, which in my view is this is doing,
it is turning a natural landscape into a mechanical landscape. If you destroy the beauty of nature
on that scale, because some of those sky turbines will be standing two thirds of the height of the
Cullen, the highest mountains in the sky from the platform level that they'll be on. If you
destroy that, you start to destroy people's capacity to appreciate beauty and to care about
anything that really matters in this world. And destroy their access to awe and wonder and
thus erode their imagination and destroy part of their vitality. It is a really, really serious
thing. It's as serious as it gets, in my view. So there we are. I just want to say that because
so much of what you write about and what you alerted me to is this importance in the folklore
here of the wild. How they too, you know, it's often said, oh, only kind of educated, romantic
people like you see this. But actually the ordinary people of Skye and of these places also see that
wildness as crucial. But let me put a caveat in here, because a lot of my work this year has been
engaged with Community Land Scotland. You'll find two of my papers if you go into the
website. And the whole rewilding thing, where again, wealthy people, what we call the green
layers, are buying up vast areas of Scotland to rewild them so that they can sell the carbon
and maybe later on the biodiversity uplift credits on it. And the problem that we have with this,
that it is taking control of place out of the hands of local communities by permanently
buying it up for a purpose that the layer was parachuted in.
I'm sure you know that I wouldn't be speaking for that. And life is complicated. And one has to,
yeah, well, that's a quite different issue, frankly, from the one I'm talking about,
which is the deliberate destruction and violation of the few places of natural
wildness and beauty that we have left. I think that is appalling. And so I'm not talking here
about the rewilding by green landlords from elsewhere. But there are many sides to most
questions, but some are so clear that we ought to be doing something to defend our world.
Well, I think we have to have what I would call ecological restoration alongside the people.
Many of these places were cleared of their people historically.
Exactly.
Young people cannot buy places to live in a place like Scotland.
Because second homers and what have you, price them out of the market.
How do you pull that together? At the deepest level, you pull it together by reactivating
imaginative potential. I've been working this past month on an SE for Dark Mountain Journal,
which I have titled A Sermon to the English on Land Reform. And it's set out in the structure
of a traditional Scottish sermon. It'll be out in Dark Mountain Journal, I think probably around
Easter time. And it's basically suggesting to the English what they need to do to achieve what
we're doing in Scotland was now about 3% of our land and community land trust, so 500 community
land trust. But that comes from the artists and musicians. It comes from the poets. It comes from
the songwriters. It comes from the visual artists who inspire a vision, your right hemisphere style,
inspire a vision of what the future can be so that we remember what has been dismembered.
We revision how the future could be. And then we do the political and practical left hemisphere work
of reclaiming how to bring it into being. And we're in a perilous political time just now,
because these massive amounts of money and the desperate imperative of action and climate change
is powering up forces, which in my view are recolonising our land and should have no place
in modern Scotland. And you're so right that it is also important that this is to do with a cohesive
community and a cohesive society. But I don't think that speculators from other countries coming in
and, you know, the Chinese are behind the dispoliation of many Greek islands. They put money into it
and these are not really beautiful and sacred landscapes are destroyed. Anyway, there we are.
I'm not arguing here that we don't need green energy, we do, but we have to do it in a different way.
Yeah. Thank you both so much. I'm here to usher in the next phase of the evening to bring in the,
the, you know, feeding the 5,000, but it's going to say feeding the 500, but it's about that.
And I want to ask a couple of things, partly to give people time to write their questions.
Because of the numbers here, choosing people from the audience is far from straightforward.
So we'd much prefer if you could please write your question. The chat is now reopening.
And we have, I have colleagues who'll be looking at those questions and choosing among them.
It's not as simple as first come, first serve. We're trying to get a range of viewpoints, a range
of kinds of people. And we're trying to kind of keep in mind what's been asked before. So if we
don't pick your question, please don't take offense. It's, it's not personal. I'm really glad
with where you ended up in a way. I know it was a bit tense, but it's sort of interesting because
I began introducing perspective in terms of systems, souls and society. And you kind of got
there at the end because, you know, you begin with second sight and premonitions and possibly
the paranormal and the sacred and you, but you come around to, you know, a real life political
issue in a beautiful place with contested values and competing economic logics and so on.
And for me, this is really in some ways where it's at. It's the challenge of how do you,
how do you navigate these different things? So the question is first of all for Alastair and I
have a slightly different one for Ian, although you can both answer them both. I'll say you invoke
imagination and I know Ian would be a big fan of imagination in general as well. But I wonder
sometimes if people expect too much of imagination. If it's, if it's always assumed to be filled with
goodness, because there's also dark imagination. There's also the imagination of those who long
for world domination and so on. How, what is it in the nature of imagination that gives you hope or
rather what, what forms of imagination need to be brought into being such that they're actually
beneficent and positive and not destructive? What, what, tell me more about what it is that
gives you faith and imagination? I think that as Henri Corbass says in his book on Ibn Arabi,
it must be grounded in the divine. Hebridean people take God very seriously. They take God
as a matter of fact, a matter of experience. In Bernard Shaw's play, Joan of Arc, which is
somewhere behind me. Don't turn around to get it. No, no, we know it, we know it.
It was my fairy god. There's my, you see my, what a wonderful fairy I've got. Her inquisitor,
special to her. How do you know that the voices of God that you hear are not just your imagination?
And Joan says, but that is how God speaks to us. That is how God speaks to us. So on your question
about dark imagination, I would say that if imagination, if I work with imagination, it's
our work of art and of intellect. It's not grounded in the God space. If it is not grounded
ultimately in prayer, we must be very careful. Otherwise, as many native peoples will tell you,
the gift or charism can very easily turn toxic and poison both its processor and those around it.
So I would say that if we are working with imagination, Jonathan, consider starting from
a place of prayer, consider starting from a place of offering yourself and your works to that which
will serve what the Russian Orthodox call the Philokalia, the love of beauty, the divine beauty,
our relationship with each other. Thank you, Alastair. Ian, do you want to come in on that?
I've got a direct question for you as well. Yeah, well, I would say I think courage said something
like that the imagination is the repetition in the finite mind of the infinite I am. So
really saying the same thing that it is the way in which God speaks, but you're right that it can be
perverted as all things in the human realm can be perverted. And I don't want to go there now
because it would take us too long, but I would stand up for the idea that there is a drive which wishes
to thwart and pervert and that it's what is traditionally meant by evil. I think it is a
real thing that has power in human doings and people think I'm mad, but I defend myself on
another day. But that's what I would say about it. So Ian, it's up to the follow-up question to that
and this is the last one I'll ask. My sense is that very few people will think you're mad,
but some might find you coy in the sense that we had a moment there where we were
aligning between the paranormal and the sacred. And I understand with your scientific background
and due caution about misinformation and being misunderstood and so on, I fully respect and
understand that to keep things grounded and real and yet open as well at the same time. And we've
had this kind of conversation before. But intriguing for me that as we're talking about
fairies and you're joking with Alistair about fairies, I think there must be some people in
the audience who are like, what are they? Are they really saying they're fairies? And on second
site in premonition, are we actually, is it okay now in a public conversation for reputed people
to obtain these possibilities? I'm just saying, is that indeed the case?
Well, fairies and second site are not the same thing and it depends exactly what you mean by
fairies, not as they're commonly imagined, but more messengers perhaps from another realm such
as angels were thought to be. Although I'm not conflating the two, I have to answer so quickly,
I can't really make the niceties I want. But my view on second site and the paranormal is exactly
that of my hero, Johnson, he ended up saying, I came away not entirely convinced but willing to
believe. He listened to the evidence, he was interested in the evidence, he asked more questions,
he didn't dismiss it, he thought there's probably something here, I don't know quite what it is.
And that's, it's not coinage, it's, I think, a natural
discrimination between types of issues about which one can be relatively certain and those that one
can't. Right, okay, thank you very much. So listen, can I just say, Johnson, you know,
there's a huge amount, I mean, that's just three I could reach just now. There's Ted Cowan, the
late Professor of Scottish History at Glasgow University with Lizanne Henderson and Scottish
Fairy Belief. In Scottish scholarship, this has taken very seriously because it is understood
as being about ways of seeing into and talking about the imagination. It's like it's a symbolic
way of speaking about things. Okay, I appreciate that and I appreciate both of you
being both open about it and discerning and discriminating about it. We have some great
questions. If it's better to hear from the person if possible, so we're going to try this initially
and if it doesn't work out, I'll just read them out. But first of all, Catherine Lord, do you want
to try and raise your hand and if we can find you, we'll unmute you. Hello. Okay, let's have your
question. Thank you. Yes, I'm interested in how we educate children and the implications of
the seeing in whole ways and seeing with our imagination and what we do with our children
in schools. And I'm just interested in how you feel maybe our education system might need to change
so that we don't take, stop us being able to see things in with our right hemisphere.
Well, naturally, I feel very strongly about that and I've talked many times about how I think
education in this country and in the West generally could be reformed. I think the loss of the
humanities, the prevalence of only STEM subjects is disastrous. And I think that education is
about awakening a mind that is seeking, not about sating a mind with information and then
agitated. I think teachers should be freed up to talk about, I mean, not go wild, but to talk
about the things that really interest them. That was how I was educated. And it worked because
the spark came to me, if you like, that was right hemisphere speaking to right hemisphere.
So I think all those things really in brief. Thank you. I appreciate that. I would come in at
that. Here's Rudyard Kipling Puck of Pooks Hill just handed out to me by the Christmas tree fairies.
You know, it's fascinating because what's going on in the first chapter of this book,
and Kipling's mother was one of the McDonald sisters, four sisters who had their family roots
in Skye. What's going on there is that Puck appears when the children say by oak and thorn
and ash or something like that, Puck appears, he's the last fairy in English, England, because he says
the English are frightened the rest of us away. And he says, I too will go when the trees are all gone.
What does he do to reconnect the children? But he reactivates their imagination. Okay, he starts
telling them their history. It's a very robust your history, as you'd expect from a writer of the
empire, not the kind of thing you'd read to children today, perhaps. But that is what's so
fascinating. He starts telling stories. So in answer to the questioner's question, I would say
the way you reactivate imagination in children is story, is beauty, is creativity.
Yes. I'd just like to say, though, that I'm certainly, I don't speak for others, but I'm not
saying that rigor, clarity, logic, and all these things are not important. They're under
taught, actually, these days, children are indoctrinated rather than taught how to think on
both sides of a question. So I'm not saying that I'm just saying that we need to get back into the
curriculum, imagination, narrative, myth, poetry, music, drama, all the rest. Yes, history, our own
history, above all, but history of other places, too. Thank you, Ian and Alistair. And thanks for
the question, Catherine. Caroline Thompson, if you could please raise your hand and let yourself be
known. We'll try and unmute you. And while you're getting ready, if Anne-Louise Walters can also
do the same. But first of all, Caroline, if we can find you. Hi. Hi. Thank you so much for answering
my question. I'm a composer and I write music. And I always feel people appearing in my music who has
recently died or people who I'm very interested in while I'm writing. And since you are both like
the heart and ratio in the philosophy and poetry, I was thinking, maybe you could have
a poetic discourse about how people who died influenced my music and where the music comes
from anyhow. So that's a bit broad. Yeah, I know. It's a bit of a complicated profession.
Yeah, do you want to take it on? Well, I'll kick off if you like.
I mean, of course, immediately I thought of Elgar's Enigma Variations, which were pieces of music
inspired by people some of whom had recently died. But I don't think that's what you're talking about.
I mean, I think that the question where these things come from is very interesting. But the answer
seems to be that they do not certainly originate in our conscious mind. They come through us in
they come through us in some sense, how far away that that thing originates, I don't know,
from my consciousness. But it certainly comes through my unconscious mind. And I think it
comes to all artists in that way. And it's probably something bigger than ourselves that
we don't appreciate that is speaking to us in forms. So I mean, that's really what I would
briefly say. Thank you. I have a whole chapter on creativity, by the way, in the matter of
things. Yeah. Alastair? Well, just I know that when I'm writing, and I really start tripping out.
It's like, I don't cry easily, but a few tears will come to my eyes. And it's just like,
I'm immersed in something. And I'm telling it as it is, Ian talked about the importance of truth.
Truth with a capital T is so important, because you're in the Greek, the word,
the Greek New Testament, the word truth, Elysia, also means reality. In the Sanskrit, the word truth,
the word truth, Satya, Uganda, Satya Graha, truthfuls. Also, as Gandhi points out,
means realityfuls. So we're talking here about real creativity. We're not talking about narcissistic
art, egotistic art. We're talking about real creativity is about being receptive to listening
to cosmic truth. And allowing that to come through in whatever our art or in Ian's case with his
book is intellectual creativity. It is trying to give expression to honouring that, honouring that.
Thank you. Thank you. A little shade of something that Jonathan and I mentioned,
I'll just say this quickly, which was that sometimes there is also a slight dark side to this.
My own experience of the daimone that works in me when it does is that it's pretty ruthless.
I don't really care about my health or happiness. Yeah. Yeah. Ask my wife the same question.
I mean, Ian, I was dealing with a talking binbecula and an old woman came up afterwards and said to
Viren, my wife, are you his wife? Viren said yes. And the old woman said he must be very hard to
live with. Surely not. Caroline, I'm just trying to get through a few more questions just to
respect the audience. So, Caroline, I think you're unmuted now if you want to ask your question.
Yeah. Your discussion of Sianolas was about the place of longing and it kind of made me
remember the concept of thin places and that idea that in those sacred places, spiritual places, you
are very close, like a hair breath away from the divine. Do you have any comments on that?
Am I getting close to what you were referring to? Absolutely is what I said. So, I don't mean to jump
in ahead of you again, Aleph. But I mean, that is exactly what I mean. That's what people say
when they come here. This is one of the thin places. It is. It absolutely is. And the other world
is closer here and no wonder, therefore, one can hear, feel, and see things that the noise of the
city drowns out. Thank you very much. And then we have a question from our old friends. No, no, no.
George McLeod of the Iowa community. One of George's things was George's big question is
what's the matter? And he said, matter is the matter. It is when we forget that the
divine is incarnate in matter. That's when that's when we have to ask what's the matter,
because we've forgotten that incarnation. You may have forgotten what's the matter with things.
Yeah. Good moment, Ian. Just to briefly remind us that the meaning of your title,
the matter with things, because that appears to be pertinent. Since you're saying there's
something going wrong that needs sorting out, what's the matter? And there's a lot of the matter
is to do with our privileging of a kind of very debased idea of matter, devoid of any imminent
spirit, simply lumpen matter, and our belief that the world is composed of things. It isn't.
It's relational, and things secondary emerge from a web of relations.
Okay, wonderful. Thank you for that quick answer. Rupert Reid, our old friend, Rupert Reid, come
and give us a question. Rupert. Good evening, both. So I wanted to pick up on Ian's remarks about how
we are disconnected, estranged from truth in this civilization. And I wanted to suggest
that while that's completely true, there's also a tendency which is opposite, maybe equal,
that's what I'm kind of asking, which is of an enormous hunger for truth that you can sense here
tonight in the audience, but also in the two of you. For me, one of the ways this has come through
very strongly in recent years is in the absolute determination in the climate movement to break
through in a new way by truth telling and not staying in the normal confines of a sort of
conservative risk analysis of where we are at. So if there's a question, the question would be,
I'd love to invite you both to comment on, well, firstly, whether you agree, and secondly,
if so, how do we enable this second tendency, the tendency of the love for the truth and the
authentic to overtake the first tendency which Ian was so powerfully mentioning?
You go ahead, Anderson. Rupert, I missed the very last, because we're getting lots of
captions coming up over my transcripts and I'm very deaf, I missed your very last point of your
question. Could you just repeat it? So the very last point was, how do we strengthen the tendency
to love for the truth, the love of truth, to disconnect from it? You be truthful. You make
an ethic of trying to be truthful. It's very difficult. We're in a culture where we are all
expected to tell little white lies because they help to lubricate our relationships. Well, bugger
that. That starts to distort. It's very difficult. It's very difficult. I don't think any of us
always succeed, but you really work being truthful. You work on being honest. I had a dream last night
about this. I had a nightmare last night. I woke up about three in the morning.
I was at the end of our house, the surgery in Louisbus. I was standing by the road and it was
dark. It was pitch black and what we would call a poor truan, a poor soul, a very simple man in
the village. She used to wander from house to house. We're standing there and he pointed out
across the moors. He said to me, there's a madman raging out in the moor over there.
I went back into the house. I started locking all the doors for my father's medicine square and all
the rest of it. There was a sense of this oppression, this fear coming in over me and a sense of
that the madman was out to get what my father, the doctor, represented and the National Health
Service. Then I woke up and for a while I was lying in bed spooked. When I woke up this morning,
it all fell into place, Ian, in terms of the questions you've been raising about the dark
side of the creatives. Who was the madman out in the wilds? The madman was your right hemisphere.
The madman was what the doctor's surgery and medicine and the NHS cannot control.
The dream was saying, don't forget the madman. The truth is facing that. The truth is acknowledging
that. I get what you're saying there, but I don't want anyone who to run away with the idea that
I think that the right hemisphere has anything to do with madness. The left hemisphere is much
closer to that. It's our truth-telling organ, actually. I go into that for great length in the
first part of the book. What I would say in our answer to you, Rupert, is that you don't have to
teach a hungry person to love food. People are starved of truth and they know it. That's why
there's a hunger for people to buy an incredibly long book which aims to help them on a journey.
From the messages I get from people all over the world of all ages, they don't feel they've been
let down on that. They feel they have been taken somewhere that has made a difference to how they
think. That's really what I'd say. I've just finished reading that hideous strength by C.S. Lewis.
I don't know if you've read it. It's quite a good book, really. It really is about how when people
see something desperate happening and destroying everything beautiful and imaginatively rich,
they eventually, the falseness crumbles. I hope that we all live to see that happen.
Thank you both. Thank you, Rupert, for the question. In the interest of time, Gary Hoover,
I'm going to slightly paraphrase your question, which is a great question. In effect, Gary is
arguing, and I've noticed the same thing, that many describe the modern world in terms of an
anthropogenic extinction event, that the world, as we know it, is ending typically ecologically,
but sometimes technologically. This may or may not be an accurate scientific prognosis,
but it's limited, sort of reductionistic and technical in its perception. There are other
ways of framing this in terms of, I don't know, apocalypse, Armageddon, or something more imaginal
or this kind of thing. How would you see it, both sort of scientifically and more spiritually,
how would you describe the state of the world and the predicament that we're in?
And I'll go with that. Alistair first, please.
I don't think we're going to, as human beings, become extinct. Many other species are already
becoming extinct because of their actions. I don't think we're going to become extinct,
as some people make out. I think the challenge of these times is to take in the suffering of the
world that we are all participants in creating and to use it as a wake-up call to building community
and creating beauty or being open to the creation of beauty through us.
In my most recent book on climate change, Riders and a Storm, I've written two books on climate
change, but the most recent one, the final two chapters are about community land trusts in
Scotland because that is where, on the ground, I see beauty being recreated, both with nature
and in human nature. And that is something we can all do. Whether we're in an urban context,
like I am here in Governing Glasgow or in the Hebrides or whatever, we can all work on our
relationships with each other and our relationships with nature, making beauty, making love.
It's not rocket science, it's just about sharing, making a meal, cooking, sharing a book, having
a chat like this tonight. Thank you, Ian. How bad are things? Well, I guess I'm also interested
just in your sense of how bad things are, like, you know, how the state of the world... Well,
I would say, first of all, amen to everything that Alistair said there, those words could
have come from my lips. I do think things are very bad. I think it's possible to use various
techniques we have of soothing ourselves and thinking that it's probably not all that bad.
And it may not be that bad because prediction is an imprecise art. We usually are not entirely
accurate in our predictions. And science and imagination need to be in dialogue. Science alone
cannot really tell us what's wrong with the world we're in or where it's going next. Imagination
has possibly more to say about that, but the fact that science can give us, when it can give us
facts that we can rely on, which is not as often as people think, is very valuable. And you know,
my whole epistemology, Alistair, in the second part of my book, is that we need to bring together
science and reason with intuition and imagination, that none of these is dispensable, and we need to
bring them all to bear. I think if we do, we see both that things are very bad. And in my view,
that there is the possibility for something unforeseen to happen, which is a revolution in
the human spirit. And that may sound all very well when we're facing these practical problems.
But actually, the practical problems won't be solved by simply practical solutions. They also
need to be coupled to a renewal of a spiritual dimension to our lives. And I think the signs
that that is very much craved by the young and the old now, and that this is a sign of hope,
and that also just to say, because you said something like we can all play a part,
this is hopeful for everyone, because people say, oh, what can I do? I'm so small, the world's so
big. And by the way, our world is so small, look at the size of the cosmos. That's got nothing to do
with meaning. That is the left hemisphere's way of thinking, measuring. But actually,
how big is love? How big is the divine? How big is the sacred? And they're all in here,
and they can all begin from here, and you can unleash them, you can grow them. And that is what
we can all begin that work tonight, not even tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I mean, if this was an auditorium, applause with breakout at this point. Listen,
thank you. We've reached our 101 minute mark. And I'm very grateful to you both. I'm grateful
for the audience questions. I would encourage those who've enjoyed the chat during the Q&A
to save it. There is a way of doing that whereby you look for the dot dot dot sign, the ellipsis,
and click on that, and it usually lets you save the chat. That will give you access to any links
that were given there. And I'd also encourage you to search out Alastair's books, particularly the
ones he mentioned, Writers on the Storm and Climate Change, I very much recommend.
Poacherous Pilgrimage and Soil and Soul. For Ian, of course, the matter with things, particularly
highly recommended. And if you want to check out Perspectiva, we've also given our link to the
website. Here we have a sub-stack, which you're welcome to join. And if you become a paid subscriber,
there will be perks forthcoming for those who do so. Thank you very much.
You need to see email for the fairy on the top of Alastair's Christmas tree.
All the books that you need at the very moment you need them.
Yeah, if you want the books at hand, I'll get that contact information for the Christmas
tree fairy later, Alastair. But for now, I wish you all a thank you. And you can just
briefly unmute to say bye. It's going to be a bit cacophonous, but let's enjoy the merriment for
a second, if we can do that, guys. If not, then we'll just have to enjoy the silence.
Uh, thank you.
