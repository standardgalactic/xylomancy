Welcome. Good to be here. Thank you for coming. My name is Jonathan Rausen. I am Director
of Perspectiva and I have known Ian for 12 years, I realized today, and in that time
come to understand his work, I hope, and certainly enjoyed his work and found a great
deal of importance in it, and we're the very proud publishers of The Matter with Things,
which is an extraordinary book over two volumes, and the paperback has just come out officially
today. So tonight's event is partly a way of marking the, I don't know if it's still
a launch when it happens the second time, but the kind of re-enchantment of the book
through the act, let's say. And Perspectiva, for those who don't know, we think that based
on the data we could receive from who's joining tonight, roughly a third of you are familiar
with Perspectiva, and maybe roughly two-thirds not so much. We are a charity based in London,
although our reach is quite global because of the digital world, and we have staff that
are outside of London as well. We are funded primarily by the Fetzer Institute in the USA,
and I say that now because that's what makes tonight's event being free possible, that
an additional funding that we received, particularly for this event. And Perspectiva, it's worth
just saying a few things about it to contextualize why we're interested in Ian's book and what
the series is about. So we sometimes call ourselves an urgent 100-year project, and
it's interesting when you say that. Some people hear the hundred years and think that's far
too long, and the point of saying an urgent 100-year project is deliberately to get to
that problem of sort of playful paradox being somehow the reality of things, that we think
that we do urgently need to rethink the world, reimagine the world, we conceive the world,
but at the same time, it's not something that is in kind of action panic mode. We're not
in the business of trying to put fires out as such. We're trying to reconceive the world
from first principles and give intellectual permission and social permission to people
who want to try to reimagine how the world might be, not just next year, but in 10 years
or in 100 years. And that kind of work often takes quite a philosophical dimension, but
a lot of our work is also applied. We do a lot of sort of social innovation of various
kinds, and of course, a publisher. So there's more to say, but if you'd like to understand
perspective of better, someone can put in the chat, our website, and do have a look around.
Although tonight's event is free, you are very welcome to make a donation. If you're interested
in the work we do already, or if you're becoming interested, and later after this event, we'll
be asking if you want to sign up to our work and get to know us better. So first of all,
welcome. And I'm very grateful to Ian for making it possible to have so many of you here.
So this series is called Attention as a Moral Act. And I want to just draw your attention to
a line in the first book here. The big tomes, so it just takes a second to come to it. But Ian,
for those of you who don't know Ian's work, and I'm assuming we're working on the assumption
that you mostly do. He says here, we'll just find it. Yeah, it's not a small claim. Ian says this
right at the beginning of the introduction, I believe we have systematically misunderstood
the nature of reality. I believe we have systematically misunderstood the nature of
reality, and chosen to ignore or silence the minority of voices that have ensured it as much
and consistently maintained that this is the case. Now we have reached the point where there is an
urgent need to transform both how we think of the world, and what we make of ourselves. Attempting
to convey such a richer insight is the ambition of this book. So he sets himself a very high bar
that we're systematically misunderstood, misrepresented reality. And what's interesting
for me as a civil society leader of a civil society organization is, many people ask how to
make Ian's work relevant. And this is a non trivial task, because someone has been alongside it in
some way for 12 years. It's not as simple as because Ian says X, the policy should be Y. It's
never that simple. But Ian's comment there does point to this quality of kind of the need to
reconceive who we are and what we're living for at a very fundamental level, to have a chance of
surviving and thriving in the 21st century and beyond. So the stakes are kind of high. So the
combination of the really high stakes, but often the quite deeply philosophical content, makes it
a particular kind of discussion. You know, it's, it's important for me, our job here in this series
is to try to move the conversation towards people beginning to perceive it and experience it and
understand the view of the world presented in these books in a way that allows them to act
differently, not as kind of premise to conclusion, but as a shift of perception, a kind of meta
noya sort of completely new frame of mind that allows them to live differently, to prioritize
differently and so on. So that's what this series is about. And we call it attention as a moral act
to get to that feeling of it matters how you attend to the world. And these books help to explain
both what that means and why. And we're going to have, we already have scheduled for two weeks
time, Zach Stein. And then laterally, soon after that, we have Phoebe Zach, Zach will be speaking
about value, value-ception, the notion of value as being something that you can actually perceive,
a very profound notion in Ian's work. Phoebe Tekel will be grappling with imagination. She's
an imagination activist she calls herself, so she'll be interested in the kind of theoretical
basis of her work. Bonito Roy will be speaking about the notion of what it means for a society to
be insane, whether we are in some meaningful sense insane, the books subtitle, as you may know,
is our brains, our delusions, delusions, sorry, delusions, and the unmaking of the world. So this
notion of what it means to be deluded at scale will be that that focus. And then we also have a
discussion on the physics in Ian's book with a physicist, Philip, remind me of his second name,
Philip Goyle, Philip Goyle, sorry, Philip Goyle, who will get into the sort of the depth of the
physics that underlies some of Ian's theorizing. So that's ahead. And then we have another six
or so after that. And we want this conversation to go on to try and really tease out from unusual
places, what to make of Ian's work, like what how does it help us reorient to the situation
of the world's in at the moment. So that's all going on. And I think I've mentioned everything
essential. So the first question really, I want to speak to Ian tonight about something I call
the McGillchrist maneuver, half in jet, totally an earnest, but we're going to come to that a
little bit later. The first thing I want to do really is most people here know Ian as a talking
head, perhaps from Channel McGillchrist, perhaps from a lecture, and they'll know his writings
from his books. But there is an intellectual formation story. You know, Ian sometimes gives
the impression of being a polymath, but it wasn't always thus. And so I'm interested in if you could
please, slowly, but surely, yet somewhat quickly, talk us through the key turns of your intellectual
formation, because you appear to have this sort of polymathic erudition. And I suppose I mentioned
doesn't know where it came from. Well, as with all polymathic erudition, it's probably not as
exciting as it looks. But it started in childhood. I was a very kind of secularist child. And that's
probably true as well. And I was interested in many things. My father was a doctor, but it was
mainly my mother's father, my grandfather's interest in science that fired my imagination.
As a child, he used to love going to stay with him and being, he showed me many fascinating
things in science in the workshop, in the garden, and so on. And that made me think, wow, this is
something I really need to know more about. And I suppose that was the general drift of my intellectual
life until I, at the age of 12, which is of course a very important turning point for everybody,
I got to be at the school where I could explore many things. And I've really always been
philosophically minded. There were a number of things that occurred to me and seemed terribly
important that were different from what everyone taught me or what everyone seemed to imply at any
rate. And these were things like that the whole is never the same as the sum of the part, you know,
when I used to say this to people, they said, Well, what is this magical something extra that
goes in there? And at the time I felt, you know, well, that's all very well, but it's not quite
right. But I couldn't articulate it at the time. I can't now, I think. I thought that the world was
not a sort of unresponsive dump of mache was it was a deeply responsive, vibrant, living,
reverberative experience in that whatever it was was a two way process between the world around
me, particularly the natural world and me, I thought that opposites were not necessarily
as far apart as people seem to think. In fact, I started to think that opposites often seem to
coincide and that the further you push something, the more you approach the very thing you're fleeing
from. I thought that history generally seemed to move in spirals, not in not in a sort of linear
trajectory. And I thought that the general tendency of the analytic mind that was very much
prized in my education was to take things abstract them, decontextualize them and render them no
longer unique and alive. And this was an odd thing because doing this was important. It was
definitely what we did. And I seem to be good at it. But I also thought this is not enough.
And then
your thoughts are arising when you're 12 or is that rather when they began?
No, no, I would say probably about 13 or 14. And what happened at the school I was at,
Winchester College, was that you did your own levels in the first term, or at least by the
end of the third term, the end of the first year. So at age 12, when I got one's own levels out of
the way. And the rest of the time was free to really explore many things. And there were three
strands to it. One was a science ladder, one was a humanities, i.e. the history and languages,
and the other was the classics. And everybody had to, whatever they chose as their special area,
they all had to do a hard core that never drops things like mathematics, history, English, and so
forth. And I started off, in short, by jumping onto the science ladder, because that seemed to me
the thing that was most interesting. And I very quickly found, as my mind unfolded in this, as I
became slightly more of a mature person than I was at 12, that things like history and literature
were vastly important. So I hopped to that one. And then finally, I hopped to the classics
so that rather unusually, I managed to straddle all three of these things. I've never been able to
seem to make up my mind about what it is I particularly want to specialize in. And then I
wanted to go to Oxford to study philosophy, and particularly the kind of philosophy that was not
the terrifically dry splitting of hairs, but the kind of philosophy that saw into the depths of
things and had a place in it for the idea of a God. Because I came from a God, I can put it this
way from a godless household, I mean, one in which we never went to church, my parents didn't talk
about that kind of thing, to being in my teens struck by the force of what one can only call
the sacred in nature, in music, in art, and in the fellowship and community in which I lived.
So I was changing at that point. But I'd always wanted to do philosophy. And as I say,
I was excited because in Oxford, there was a course called philosophy and theology, which was
just what I wanted to do. So I did the exam and I went up for interviews. And I had to do the exam
in some school subject, which just happened to be English literature. And the people who interviewed
me said, Oh, you can't do philosophy and theology, it's not an honest degree. So in 1971,
philosophy and theology was not even an honest degree at Oxford. There's a simple reason it had
only just been founded. And I don't think it had had time to acquire that status. But they said,
instead, you must do PPE, philosophy, politics and economics. And I'm sorry to say this to
somebody like Hugh Jonathan, who's learned and excited by both philosophy and by both politics
and economics, I'm not particularly. And I wanted the other thing. And they said, Well, look,
I don't want to do that. So they said, Well, come and do literature, because it's quite
philosophical, if you want it to be. And so I did, I read English literature. After I got my
degree, I was then encouraged to sit the exam for all souls college, which is an odd college.
It doesn't have any students, not graduates, not any kind of students. It's really just a kind of
an intellectual hot house for people who can be assumed to be somewhere near the head of their
game. And it was a very exciting seven years I had there. When I arrived there before the seven
before you got admission, I want to pause there because I happen to know something that's of
interest to the audience, maybe. I took the exam myself, I believe in 2001 and did not pass.
But I do remember the, at that time, had one of the five papers being a single word essay
question. And it was diversity, which is quite curious given the current world. But what's also
curious is I believe yours was on evil. Do you remember what you said about evil that got you
admission to all souls? Well, I wouldn't have remembered, but a philosopher, Derek Parfit,
was a colleague who was so taken with that essay that I wrote that he photocopied it.
And when I became a fellow, he gave it to me. So somewhere in a box in the attic, if I could
ever find it, there is that essay. I was alarmed because I sat in this room with, I suppose,
20 people. We were competing for at maximum two fellowships. And very often one or none were
appointed. And in the room, people started to write after five or 10 minutes. And I sat there
and I was sort of thinking, half an hour went by, I could see everyone scribbling, I still
wasn't writing, three courses of an hour went by. And finally, at two hours, I was just so,
if you like, wired, I just thought I've got to write. And I just did in that hot fire of
the pressure of time. Anyway, that was that. It's an extraordinary exam. I hope it's not
too different, these days. It seems to me to be able to try and take in people who are not just
very good at their special thing, but actually can think broadly about many topics. So there were
general papers. It was you who told me and that they did away with the one word question in the
exam. I think they have done. I think they have. The quality had decreased so much that
they weren't sure it was worthwhile. I don't know if that's the case. I think that was the
case with the language. There was a language paper where you just had to translate as many
pieces as you could in three hours from Greek, Latin, German, Spanish, French, Russian, and
Italian. I think they stopped doing that. I'm sorry about the essay because I think it was a
real test of something, a kind of ability to think broadly and differently. But they do still have,
I think, the special subject papers alongside general papers. It doesn't matter what subjects
you're taking the exam in, you have to answer some general questions. Anyway, there it was.
And when I got to all of those, I had planned to do a thesis on 18th century literature and
ideas, the transition from the Enlightenment to Romanticism. But a number of people, but most
vocally, again, Derek Parfit, a very, very considerable philosopher, I think by most people
considered the greatest philosopher of his generation, had started as a historian. And he
said to me, you don't know where you may want to go. Don't do that. You've been given something
very special. You can do a doctorate at any college, but you've been given seven years
in which you can do anything and there'll be no questions asked. You can read what you like.
So I did. I spent that time doing a lot of things. I read a lot of science, of course,
but I also read philosophy, went to philosophy seminars and other things. I found myself a
Russian teacher and so on. So that just generally broadened my horizons. But I began to think at
the end of this, what am I going to do next? I don't want to just to go into some sort of
normal academic rut. There's something wrong with the way we studied literature. And I wrote a book
called Against Criticism, published by Faber in 1982, in which I laid out the philosophical
basis for why the academic study of literature is somehow vitiated. It destroys the very thing
it's trying to get hold of. Anyway, I won't go into that except to say that in brief, I thought
there were three important things about, say, a poem was that somebody in the past wrote something
that they thought was very meaningful and important, so important that they poured some very,
you know, they suffered in order to produce this thing. And along we came with our clever,
sneering attitudes from the 20th century and sort of encouraged to deconstruct it in a certain
way. But more importantly, what happened was that we abstracted something that was deeply contextual
and embodied. We generalized something that was unique. And we lost the sense of the living
thing that we were looking at that is unique, embodied and implicit. And in the process of
analyzing it, we taken this importantly implicit material out and made it explicit. And that's
as deadly as explaining a joke. Explaining a poem is death to the poem. So I wanted to move on,
and I got very interested in this issue, what was wrong. And it struck me that it was to do with
the mind-body problem that we neglected the body. And I was familiar with the philosophers. I went
to their seminars and heard what they had to say about the mind-body problem. But it seemed to me
they were just too disembodied in their approach. And so I thought I ought to do something more
embodied about this. And at that time, Oliver Sacks had just published Awakenings, which was
one of the many sort of real milestones in my intellectual development. Because here was somebody
who related illness to an analysis of what we are when we are well and healthy, who related what
was going on for an individual person, beautifully realized in his text. And he was able to see in
it general truth, general philosophical truth through that highly individual vignette. And that
most of what he was saying was actually in the footnotes, it was as implicit as it could be.
So anyway, I thought, well, I want to be somebody like Oliver Sacks. And that meant going to medical
school and learning neurology and going into psychiatry and the overlap area between neurology
and psychiatry. So I did that. I became a doctor.
Let's just throw that into some words for a second, just because you seem to be saying
two things there. One is, in a very real sense, your first book on literary criticism prefigured
the master and his emissary that came much later. There was a sort of very clear overlap and the
kind of concerns you had. Yes. Which even went back to my adolescence at school. Yes.
Right. And the second thing is that there's a very clear figure of admiration that sort of
propelled you forward into a way of looking at the person, scientifically and philosophically.
I want to make sure we've been a number of days. Now, I'm worried about just taking up too much
time. It's worthwhile because people don't know these licenses. They don't know these things.
And it's good to get your work done around. So then you go to medical school
and later become a psychiatrist. And particularly you have to Baltimore, right?
And their brain scan things happen. That's right. But perhaps just before that, I should say that I
was at the Maudsley Hospital in London, the Bethelman Maudsley Hospital, which is a great
British teaching hospital. They would like to think the greatest British teaching hospital
in that area. And I heard a lecture there one day by a man called John Cutting, who became another
influential figure for me. He'd just published a book called The Right Hemisphere and Psychiatric
Disorders with O.P. Oxford. And anyway, I almost didn't go to this lecture, but thank God I did.
Because in it, he talked about the differences between the hemispheres, which are nothing
like what I'd heard in the pop psychology stuff that is all too widely or used to be all too
widely believed. I think I've done something to erode that now. But what he was saying was that
the left hemisphere doesn't seem to be able to understand what is implicit. It understands what
is explicit. So it doesn't get tone of voice, humor, metaphor, irony, sarcasm, facial expression,
bodily posture, all the ways in which we communicate meaning. Secondly, it tends to
categorize. It takes the unique thing and it categorizes it so that the uniqueness is lost.
It becomes a representative of a type. And the third thing that I remember, but so relevant,
was of saying the right hemisphere is literally more in touch with our embodied being for a
number of reasons. I don't need to mention, but to do with its more rich connections to the limbic
system and its relationships to the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. Anyway, that fascinated
me. I went to talk to John afterwards and I then began some research on hemisphere differences.
And then I went to Baltimore and I was able to join a research group in which people were looking
at hemisphere differences. This was very exciting for me. And I became involved in researching into
the abnormal symmetry or asymmetry in the brains of people with schizophrenia. So
in the normal brain, there is a reliable finding that the left hemisphere is broader and bigger
towards the back and the right hemisphere broader and bigger towards the front. But in
schizophrenia, this is often either absent or actually reversed. And interestingly, the very
parts that get affected by this are the parts that underwrite some of our most important
capacities for making sense of the world. They're what's called hetermodal association cortex,
particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and parts of the
cingulate. So these things are very important and they are abnormal in this condition.
And that was terribly exciting. I was able to map these things and take part in research into it.
But I also, at the same time, received an excited message from John Cutting saying,
you must read a certain book. It's absolutely essential to everything you and I are concerned
about. And it was Louis Sass's book, Madness and Modernism. And its subtitle is Insanity in the
Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought. And this extraordinary book, extraordinarily clearly
and beautifully written, is the product of a mind that was able to range over many things,
over literature, over philosophy, obviously, over psychology, and over the visual arts.
And what he seemed to show was about 20 to 25 aspects of modernism, if you like, the culture
of the 20th century, mainly, and postmodernism that overlapped with elements in the experience
of subjects with schizophrenia. And I kind of knew this. Of course, of course, it was really
the most beautiful moment at which something happened to me that people say happens when
they tell me now when they read my work, which is kind of, of course, I've sort of
realized this but had no way of articulating it. Anyway, I mean, obviously, it couldn't be that
we'd all suddenly got schizophrenia, we haven't. But what seems to have happened is that we have
ignored the input of the left hemisphere, people with left hemisphere overdrive or right hemisphere
deficits, look at the world very much in the way that people with schizophrenia do. They become
frankly deluded. And that's why the word delusions is important in the subtitle of the book, The
Matter with Things, because I really believe that we are now in a world in which we have lost touch
with what the right hemisphere could have told us. And we are becoming deluded about what we are,
what the world is like, and so on. So that is some of my intellectual evolution.
And all these influences were very important. And I spent the next, I suppose, 20 years writing
The Master and His Emistry. So that really takes you up to the beginning of that one.
So okay, great. Thank you. Well, I hope that was useful for people. It certainly is for me.
And like you said, that takes you up to the publication of The Master and His Emistry,
which I believe it took about 20 years to write, although you're working at the same time, I suppose.
I was working about 55, 60 hours a week at the time. And it only took me 10 years to write the
longer book The Matter with Things, but I was writing full time.
You also, yeah, okay. And so then The Master and His Emistry came out to mostly
critical acclaim, although some critical, some critical aspects of that too, but mostly acclaim.
And then a documentary was made about your work by Vanessa Dillon. And you've been on shows with,
I don't know, John Cleese and, you know, various other people that are very well known household
names. How do you, you feel fulfilled then? Do you feel like you're like at a personal level,
you've done your work in this world?
That's an interesting thing. I think the answer is I can't help being delighted, touched, and
filled with a sense of, yes, of something having gone right. When people tell me what my work
means to them, that is the important thing. And it's not, yes, I've been on all the chat shows
and I've met the best people, but it's actually when people, individual people that I didn't know
write to me in the loveliest terms, saying what a difference it has made to their life,
not just to their intellectual life, their thinking, but also to their
relationships, to their work, to everything. And that is, I think, is the thing that fulfills
me. That is the moment, that is when I say, okay, it's all worthwhile.
Okay, so I can tell you why, what it means to me, now it's a good segue to get to what I felt
recently. So as you know, Ian, I read the entire manuscript of the matter with things,
including all of the appendices and notes, which all inclusive, I believe, comes to,
quite close to a million words, if not actually there, when you factor in absolutely everything.
And I read quite a lot of it on train journeys. I think I said in the launch party of the event
that it was a time when I knew I had to interview you about the book. And I was struggling to read
with my job and family, just finding the time to read it. So I actually created excuses to go up
and down to Scotland a few times to meet extended family and made it sound like it was all about
them. It was, I was also getting myself done so five hours each way to read the book.
Anyway, while reading it, I noticed something that kept recurring. And it was as if
it was a musical note that you hear come into a song every so often. And at the time, I couldn't
quite place it, but we spoke a bit about it when I was on Sky. And it had a certain kind of pattern
to it that I've laterally called the McGillchrist maneuver. And since then, I've been reading the
book more closely. And I think the heart of the McGillchrist maneuver, insofar as it means something,
is, is the primary hypothesis of the, what you call the hemispheric hypothesis,
which is broadly the, the brain functioning well, presencing, allowing the world to presence
itself to our own kind of appraisal and perception, then a kind of imperceptible
shift towards left to sort of make sense, categorize, and understand, then I sort of shift back to the
right, no longer quite the same for having received the input of the left. So the first
McGillchrist maneuver is a kind of right, left, right of that form. But then there's a more subtle one,
which is a little bit more analytical sounding, but it's very useful for public conversations
because you hear a lot of people saying, you know, you're thinking in a two binary manner,
it's not either or it's both and right. There's a very common refrain, you hear it a lot in sort of
popular culture even. And, and what your argument suggests, and you're not probably the first to
say this, but you say it particularly well, and it falls out of the hypothesis as well,
is that it's not so much that it's either or or both and it's in some meaningful sense,
either or and both and but not to the same extent, right. And that's the kind of like it's
many layers of subtlety on that. But you begin to see this in several different parts of the book
and where the heartland of that maneuver lies, the kind of source code of it is in chapter 20.
Chapter 20 of the book, I can say to people watching this is the business. If you want to read
one chapter of your fundamental work, honestly, and you think if you've got a glimpse of the
argument in general terms already, as most of you have, either from the prior book or just watching
a video or whatever, I think you can understand chapter 20 by itself without much other information.
You need to know something about the hypothesis, but not that much. Chapter 20 for me is like the
hinges on the door between the sort of scientific and philosophical appraisal and the sort of
cultural implications. And for those who don't know, chapter 20 is in rendered in the simple
English as the coincidence of opposites. But the word coincidence as Ian points out in the book
has somewhat been tainted. But nonetheless, so you use the Latin, I guess, coincidence,
how do you say it? Coincidence? Coincidence here? That's the one, right. Thank you. And this is really
a beautiful, beautiful chapter. Because I think that if people who are in a slightly more applied
side of things, working in civil society organizations concerned about climate change,
interested in how the arts can influence culture and thereby influence behavior or whatever,
in chapter 20, I think we see a shift in perception that is really generative of a
different way of viewing the world and acting in it. And I say this, knowing that earlier in the book,
in the first volume, you begin the book by targeting reductionism. Reductionism is kind
of the public enemy number one in the first part of the book. And I think more precisely,
reductive materialism. And you make a very strong case on that, and that stands on its own terms,
and it has its own validity and so on. But I think actually for people in the public realm,
trying to fight against reductionism with something more holistic of the kind you offer
is not necessarily as powerful as recognizing this McGilchrist maneuver in chapter 20. Because
what happens there is the enemy there is not so much reductionism. It's actually the the law of
non-contradiction. And the law of non-contradiction basically says, you know, it can't be night and
day, that you can't be right and wrong, it can't be black and white. And this chapter basically
says actually it can, and in many, many meaningful senses, not only can it be this, but this is the
beating heart of reality. These opposites that are in some kind of meaningful relationship with each
other actually are closer to the heart of things than the law of non-contradiction would ever be.
And if I could just read a few of the, few of the statements you make, for example, you speak
about the non-duality of duality and non-duality. I'll just get my notebook which fell under the
table one second. You speak about, yeah, you speak about the non-duality of duality and non-duality.
You speak about the the unity of unity and multiplicity. And you also speak somewhere very
profoundly, this is the thing I want to ask you about now, because it relates back to your
also's essay on evil indirectly, is you speak about the equal necessity, but unequal status
of spiritual opposites. And this is where you're getting at, it comes from the myth that you begin
the second volume with, but it also speaks to the perennial battle between good and evil.
And again, the McGillchrist maneuver here is very valuable, because what you seem to be saying
is it's not that it's the world's either good or bad, it's not either or, it's not that it's,
it's not simply that it's good and bad, that's not quite right either, it's that it's good and bad
and it's somewhat more good than bad for particular reasons. That's how I, at least that's how I read
it. So please. Yeah. Well, I suppose the first thing to say is to anybody who hasn't read the
book, I'm not sure apart from really in that opening myth, which is just absolutely staggering,
which is something I've learned about comes from an Iroquois people called the Onondaga.
And it's unfortunately too long to go into now, but it is the most stunning introspective
understanding of how the right and left hemispheres work together. That's the way I would look at it.
I don't really talk about the spiritual much. I address that in the last chapter, 28, because I
don't want to lose my audience along the way. And I know how all the misconceptions that surround
the idea of the spiritual, the divine and the sacred will lose people. But I want very strongly
to show them that if they follow where I've been, and you see the world in a different way,
there's nothing that's irrational or unintelligent about embracing this idea. There's something
very important about it. And I do, yes, I do in that chapter, chapter 28, at the end of the book,
I do briefly talk about the nature of evil, but it's just a very personal thing. I can't,
I can't believe the idea that evil is simply a kind of
lessening or falling away of good. I think it has its own dynamism. I think it's real and to be
reckoned with. And I think that this is part of the whole picture of the cosmos, which is that there
are different drives, if you like, that are both needed. And the intellect may try and get rid of
one or diminish one, but actually, that's just cheating. And so when I talk about the
coincidence of opposites, and I use the term, the Latin term coincidentiopositorum simply because
it was, it was the way in which it was first talked about by Nicholas of Cusa, very interesting
philosophical scientific-minded cardinal in the 15th century. And by Jung, who I think is enormously
important here. And as a psychiatrist, I can vouch that, you know, however good you think you are,
there is a dark side. And that dark side is very important. And recognizing it is enormously
important. The failure to recognize it and understand it leads to damage, destruction,
and disease. And I, so it's a, it's a hugely important thing for each of us individually,
but also for a society as a whole, to realize that in pursuing headlong, some very simple goal
that looks you perfectly good, you're destroying all kinds of other things that may be very
important. And if you push it too far, you may actually achieve the very opposite of what you
intend. I mean, a very obvious case of this is that anarchy leads to tyranny. So when, so we need,
what I'm definitely not saying is, and people might say, oh, well, if he's saying something about
the coincidence of opposites, doesn't that leave us unable to say anything about anything? Because
really anything in its opposite are true. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that context
greatly matters. And, and that these things share in some important way, their qualities.
So we need not, in fact, to reach, we must essentially never reach the position where we've
abolished both of these and just substituted some warm mediocre soup somewhere in the middle.
My point is, we need to hold both of these realities maximally, and yet hold them together.
And this is beautifully imaged in a whole range of ways in the philosophy of Heraclitus,
pre-Socratic philosopher, for me, most important philosopher in the West, anyway, that ever lived.
And he has this image of a, of a loot string or a liar string, and also the string of a bow
that shoots an arrow. And his point is that it needs to be pulled in opposite directions,
and it's very nature, it's very power to do anything at all, to give a note, to let the arrow fly,
comes from that tension being held. Now, that is what we, that is one of the many things we
don't perceive. We also don't perceive that reality has this circular spiral like, I prefer
spiral light, because in fact it doesn't circle back to where it was. It circles back to somewhere
that seems rather like it, but is now higher up the spiral because things have happened,
time has moved on. But that is an ancient image too, you know, em, em, em, em, empirically it's
thought that love and strife for the two elements that cause the woe. And it's there in, in many
philosophies around the world. We can't do away with, with one and just have the other, as Alan
what said, we can't just have the peaks and not have the valleys. So we don't get that right.
We don't understand that progress is never linear, that you're curving back towards the very thing
that you fear. And unless you watch out for it, you will go to the place you really don't want to
go to, that everything needs to be seen in context. And the way in which we talk now is to take things
out of context. So all that could in a way, if you like, be implicit in that chapter on
the clear instance of opposites and you found it. Yeah, but also the other thing that I was struck
by when I read this by you earlier, you say very amusingly, but very perturently here,
that in your many talks, and you got lots of audience feedback and lots of questions,
and you say there's a way you put it to me was there are two things people want and they can't
have either of them. And as I understand it, you can correct me on this. But the first is that
they want one thing to be better than the other, first of all, so they want the left hemisphere
to be bad and the right hemisphere to be good. And that's not right. They really want the goodie
in the baddie. They want the kind of mannequin and right hemisphere, let's all create a right
hemisphere world and forget about the left hemisphere. It's not that at all. But they also
struggle with the idea that if there's two things that matter, that they necessarily matter equally.
Right. And these things like these two points, I know that for you, they're self-evident now.
But I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I read this thinking, how can this book be
translated into some form of praxis in the community that I feel as though this kind of
this kind of capacity to see that you can have two things that are both really important,
but one is more important than the other. And yet the utter they need each other.
It's actually a bit counter-cultural. It's not actually there as one of our sort of
memes of operation. All the things I'm saying are counter-cultural because I believe our culture
is founded on simplistic falsehoods. We've mistaken the nature of reality. That's what I'm saying.
And in the first seven pages or so of the matter of things, I lay out all kinds of
things that must strike people as very improbable. That, for example, relations are prior to the
things that are related. Get that. But I stand by that throughout the book. And just for one.
But it's in the image of the master and his emissary. The master needs the emissary and knows
it. The emissary needs the master, but doesn't know it. There's an imbalance in this relationship.
And the emissary is good as long as it remains the emissary. The master is good as long as the
master remains the master. But when the emissary tries to be the master, it falls apart. Now that
image, I didn't know that. I only found out about it afterwards and in the writing of the matter
with things is central to many cultures. There are examples in Chinese mythology, in Indian
mythology, in North American native people's mythologies and so on. Of this usurping force.
And it's actually the subject of what is arguably the greatest epic poem in the English language,
Paradise Lost. It is precisely the story. So this is a very important one that there's nothing
wrong with the left hemisphere as long as it knows its limitations. But unfortunately, one of the
features of being limited is that you are limited in your knowledge of your limitations.
I mean, it's not just that it's limited and has to find its proper place in relationship.
It's wonderful. It's glorious. It's an extraordinary capacity, right? And with all
due respect, I mean, people have said of your two volumes and almost million words,
it looks like the left hemisphere has won. But I think you would counter, I think,
that this is in the service of the right, which is also quite a valid contention.
Absolutely. I've spent my life struggling to bring the left hemisphere into service to what the
right hemisphere knows. So it is quite true. The book is absolutely stuffed with real science,
with hard science. So 5600 references in the new book. It goes much further than the master
and his emissary in exploring this difference between the hemispheres and nobody can say I haven't
researched this properly. I don't think there are very few people alive in the world who would
be in a position to have read more about it than I have. So there it is. And I use reason.
Reason is my friend, not an enemy. It's just that not everything can be encompassed by reason.
Reason can't explain why a wonderful piece of music is as wonderful as it is.
The intuition and reason are both important. And again, when I chose the master and his
emissary as the metaphor, I didn't know that quote that is attributed to Einstein, that, you know,
the rational mind is a faithful servant and the intuitive mind is a precious gift.
We live in a world which honors the servant but has forgotten the gift. Well, in the second part,
the middle part, as you know, of the matter of things, I look at reason, science, intuition
and imagination and basically suggest that all of these are very important in their different
ways and we need to be able to make use of them appropriately.
Okay. All well taken. And as always with your book, there's a kind of hermeneutic kind of
process going on in which you have to go over many different aspects of your argument again and
again until the full picture becomes clearer. And one of the things I was struck by, again,
just focusing on chapter 20 for a second. It is the case. And sorry, not if. It clearly is the
case. You argue it well. It's very compelling. I believe it. That we live in a world of the
coincidence of opposites, a world in which resistance is a critical feature of life.
Oppositions, necessary movement or primary and all of the things that you argue in the second
volume. If that's the case, it's natural that we'll struggle to perceive that without the language
forms to perceive it. So on the one hand, what you're getting is a lot of people
broadly of the right hemisphere perspective, insuating that you're right. Of course, Ian's
right. This is why your books are successful. Have you read Ian's book? Yeah. And yeah,
when it comes to trying to put it to work, without the language forms to actually render
this back to the right hemisphere in a way that gives a fuller picture of context,
we'll struggle. In that respect, I was very struck that there are at least three words
in chapter 20, big words. And there's no lack of them in the books. And I feel people don't really
know. I don't know them. But the fact that they don't know them means they can't really perceive
what they're pointing towards as well. So the first is Hormesis. The second is
Silapsus. Yes, I'm talking about the finesse there. And the other, and I always struggle to
say this, but the enantiodromia is another. Yes. Can you talk us through what these three
words mean and why they matter? Because I think we sort of need to know to get a sense of what we're
talking about. Yes. Hormesis is a term from physical chemistry, originally. And it refers
to the fact that something that is toxic in substantial doses may actually be
healthful and health-promoting in small doses. There are certain very obvious examples of this.
One is digitalised, derived from the Foxclub, which is extraordinarily poisonous,
but has been used since the 18th century and is still the basis of the most effective treatments
for heart failure. Arsenic, which has also been used for 2000 years, in very small doses,
can be extremely healthful. They're obviously large doses kill. And Atropine, which is derived
from deadly nightshade, can restore function to people with certain neurological diseases.
But it really was first described and probably is still most used in describing the effects of
radiation, where large doses of radiation can obviously be damaging and cause cancers, but
small doses of radiation can in fact be health-promoting and can in fact prevent the development
of cancers in laboratory animals. It's all to do with the scale. Now, that is so important,
because what was I saying earlier, if you push and push something, you lose it. And actually,
it says this in the book of changes, in the Yi Qing, he who doesn't know when he has achieved
enough, but pushes further, loses it. So that is very important. And there's an interesting
observation that makes it vivid here. When people were looking at the biosphere too,
which is an enormous protected environment, which was erected to see how plants and even
animals would respond to being in this protected environment, they were puzzled by the fact that
healthy trees tended to fall over before reaching maturity. And what they discovered in brief was
for a tree to grow, it needs wind, it needs the stress of the wind to develop what is in fact
called stress wood, which is the core strength of that tree. And this is something that,
funnily enough, although not presumably known in that form to Nietzsche, Nietzsche actually says
this in 1870, something that in relation to human beings, that we need adversity. In a very simple
way, we need adversity because, as you know, I think that everything is in motion and contrary
to the Newtonian image that rest is the normal state and that motion is an aberration, motion is
the normal state and rest would be an aberration if it could ever be achieved. But to achieve that,
we need friction. Friction is the thing that stops motion, that's how you would describe it,
but it is also the thing that enables something to get started in moving. So that is Hormesis.
One more thought on Hormesis here before you get to syllapses. For those of you who remember,
there's a film called Dances with Wolves with Kevin Costner, just to bring it to popular
culture for a second. And the premise of this movie is basically a sort of white frontier
pioneer person getting lost within a sort of Native American tribe. And at some point,
he's captured and there's a kind of meeting around the fire to discuss what to do with him,
what to kill him, what to send him back and so on. And I'll never forget watching this because
one of the Native Americans is particularly aggressive and being for blood. He says,
we must kill him, we must kill him. And I remember thinking all the others are like
passing the peace pipes and kind of, you know, looking very quintessentially wise Indigenous
knowledge kind of picture. And yet this one guy is like a warrior saying, we need to take him out
now. And I remember feeling at the time, it's really important that he's there. It's not that
he's right, but there was something about that energy being in the room as a kind of counterweight
to the, it's not exactly hermesis, don't get me wrong, but it's a similar spirit of this thing
that's in a small dose, valuable. If they were all like that, you'd have a different problem.
And similarly, Ian, just to nail this point, you said that you prefer your dark chocolate at 70%,
is that right? Yes, correct. Yes, I do. You please tell me, why is it because
because as you increase the percentage to 85 or 90, it becomes less pleasing. It's simply,
this is why all the really best dark chocolate is 70% or 70 something percent.
The others are used for cooking because they're a pure chocolate essence, if you like.
But there are many things that are like this. For example, in Scotland,
putting a lot of water in whiskey is considered a sacrilege. But a very tiny bit of water in
the whiskey is necessary to enable it actually to unfold. It's in a richness. And there's a joke I
like, perhaps I may be indulged in it in Scotland. In Scotland, if you ask somebody,
will you have water in the whiskey? The reply is, will there be room? Anyway,
perhaps I could talk about incredulity. There will be space for the water.
For the water. So let's move on to salapsis. Salapsis is in fact the ionic form of the word
salipsis in Attic Greek, which is the one that's best known to philosophers. But it's the one that
Heraclitus used. And he has a fragment which is extraordinarily dense in my view. And it goes
like this. Salapsis, and the word is grasping in English, grasping, holds and not holds convergent,
divergent, consonant, dissonant from all things one and from one thing all. And I think that is
just extraordinarily rich. I mean, first of all, this idea of the word salapsis or salipsis is
something to do with a sudden comprehension, grasping in that sense, it brings things together,
the other idea of, you know, coincidence. And it also signifies fertility, which comes about through
the coming together of the gametes of the two sexes. So it says many things at once about this
deep nature of reality that it comes in glimpses or grasping moments of insight, and that in that
insight, it's neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply either simply whole or
simply not whole, neither simply like nor simply unlike each thing, as I say, working with and
by the same token, working against the others. The one and the many may bring things into reality,
they bring one another forth into being, generating a reality that has the structure of its core.
And that despite or in the light of all this, perhaps because of the nature of this multiplicity,
all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here that's not paired with an antithesis. So
I think that that idea is very rich. And I know what you're saying is so how do we get that into
dialogues in places where people are making decisions. I think the first thing is that we need
to, we need to emphasize that while we are busily pursuing a single goal, we're neglecting all
kinds of other things that are disappearing as fast as we're achieving that goal, that we need
therefore to be very measured and see how far we should go and not go further than that unless we
destroy, that we need to respect the fact that when we bring things together, they remain unique
and individual. This is not an abolition so that when a society is cohesive, it doesn't have,
it somehow destroy the individual, but actually enhances the individual. The individual can only
be fully an individual with the background of an integrated society. That for example, when we
move towards the future, we need to remember where we've come from in the past. We need not to jettison
the knowledge that was painfully acquired by thousands of years across the world.
People now without even knowing what they're rejecting are too quick to say, well,
we can make something new. Yes, we can. Things are always new. A river is always new. A plant
is always growing. Everything is growing and changing. Everything flows, as Eric Leiter said,
but you don't just cut it off from its roots. All of these things are things that are worth
saying. I think rehabilitating intuition is important. We haven't got time to go into all of
that, but I have three whole chapters on intuition. But this constant dismissing of
intuition is a mistake, I believe. Sorry, you were going to say something.
Well, just to down, I wanted to hear also before making sense of what these things mean together,
but a little bit on an anti-adromia, as why you use this concept as well.
Well, an anti-adromia is the easiest one to deal with. It's a term invented by Jung,
and it really refers to the fact that roads go in two directions. This was first again
commented on, at least in the West, by Heraclitus, when he said the road up is the road down.
This is really the essence of an anti-adromia. We don't need to spend much time on it,
but I think that it is very beautifully, deeply, and with great imagination, and I mean that in
the best sense, unfolded by Jung in his looking at what a human being is. It's a very important
element, as I say, in the practice of anyone trying to help a human being with their suffering,
their mental suffering. I'm just struck by these three terms when I was reading, because
they're not the kinds of things we bring to bear. We use language of systems change, and we speak
about regenerative economics, and we speak about a new narrative, and all this kind of stuff,
but these things cut much more deeply into the need to perceive reality.
We live in arguably a reality-avoidant culture, much of reality we don't want to attend to in a
certain way, and some would say it's also a kind of post-truth culture. But in order to sort of
reach towards the truth and reach towards reality, it feels like our conceptual maps are not fit for
purpose. There's a kind of, there's a linguistic drought of some kind that prevents us from seeing.
I'm not saying that we should resuscitate these fairly scholastic terms as the only way to do it,
but it does feel to me a little bit like part of the public education is to
bring such terminology to bear so that people can actually make sense again
of what's actually real and true, rather than feeling they can't actually articulate their
intuitions. Well, yes, I mean, whether or not these particular terms are the right ones,
I wouldn't like to say, although there's nothing wrong with them, I suppose. But I think that the
perception from which they stem is is explicable in terms that are not so strange. And I suppose
that's what I've tried to do in my writing, which is why one of the communist things people say is,
you gave me the words for things that I knew to be the case, but I had no language. I had no way
of saying these things. And I felt I'd be dismissed if I said them, but I've given
good groundings, reasons, and science behind why these things are important. And we need to
make this shift, we need to change our perspective on what we're doing here and who we are and what
the business of being alive is about before it's too late. Anyway, there we are.
Well, just a related example is, you know, if you watch the news and the clamour on social media
and the main forms of debates in public life, there's ubiquitous partial truth, right? People
say things, and then there's a kind of watchaboutry that's partially true, and there's a watchaboutry
response that's also partially true. But there's very little sort of shared endeavour to get to the
kind of fuller vision of the truth. Now, there's a whitehead quotation somewhere in your book about
there are no whole truths or only partial truths, or I'm not sure if he's... Exactly.
But I feel this is quite fundamental. Again, it's something to do with being,
like realising that to actually have a partial truth is in some sense the truth. It's sort of,
there is a meaningful way in which not to know everything is to know everything,
and you're getting towards that in your book, but in a way that is maddeningly elusive at a cultural
level. Well, I mean, I do talk about the importance of not knowing, which of course is not the same
as ignorance. Ignorance is what you have before you know. Not knowing is what you have after
you've gone through the process of knowledge. So all that is very true, and what Chinese call
Wu Wei, non-action, is as important. And that is in a very practical sense. People are always
saying what do we do? And one of the things that comes out of experience as a psychiatrist is the
first thing is to see what it is that you're doing that's wrong and stop doing it. So before you can
actually have room to do something new, you've got to get out of the picture the thing you're doing,
which is wrong. So, you know, all this has very practical meaning in my view. It's not just some
strange insight into the structure of being. But if we are to survive, and if we're to understand
what we're doing, we do need to have some insight into the structure of being. And at the moment,
our image of a reductionist, materialist mechanism is wrong on so many counts. And I give a lot of
them in the book. I mean, you've quoted Wu Wei. You mentioned Wu Wei there, the principal. In the
book you quote the Tauti Qing a few times. You mentioned the Yi Qing. I mean, many things,
but you're also a kind of Taoist, right? One way to understand it. I am a Taoist.
I'm precisely a Taoist, yes. That's good to know. And I could be a Christian. And if I was,
I'm probably a very bad one. But I find the Christian mythos and the Christian tradition
phenomenally rich. And it's very, you know, I couldn't say whether I am a Christian or not,
but it's not incompatible with being a Taoist at all. Or a Buddhist, for that matter. Thomas
Murphy famously was Catholic. I wanted to end by just briefly for those who are curious.
Today, I wrote a little piece trying to get my head around what I meant by the
McGillchrist manoeuvre a bit more clearly. And I just, I've said here just a short definition
for those who are interested. I say the McGillchrist manoeuvre entails the combined
perceptual and conceptual capacity that transcends contradictions, disclosing the
coincidence of opposites as generative of reality, thereby re-enchanting aspects of life long,
of re-enchanting aspects of life, long considered problematic, including tension and paradox.
So there's a kind of, you know, I think there's a real thing going on here in the
underlying structure that is principally in chapter 20, but per fades of the entire work.
And we will go now to something else, but I suppose I want to say
the whole series is called a Tension as a Moral Act. Now, just to end, please,
why is a Tension a Moral Act? If it's not obvious already, how would you describe it?
Well, I don't think it is entirely obvious. And when I discovered that
almost the foundational difference, probably the foundational difference between the two
hemispheres is the very well-known fact that they pay attention in different ways to the world.
It didn't altogether immediately strike me that I'd struck gold. This was an incredibly
important thing because part of my training was, you know, attention is a cognitive function,
you know, with memory and, you know, other things. And it therefore gets reduced to a
sort of mechanism of a kind. And I didn't realize how fundamental this is to being.
The world that we know is the product of our attention. We cannot know a world that is not
part of our attention. I must say, first of all, that I don't mean by attention, the scrutinizing
self-conscious attention. But if it hasn't come to our attention at even an unconscious level,
if we haven't imbibed it, then it can't be part of our experiential world. So I see an important
course, I think, which is, I say important because at the moment, yet again, there is a
polarization going on in which either people believe the world is simply something that's
made up in the individual mind. So this is postmodernism at its worst. It's certain kinds of
philosophy, a kind of naive idealism. And the other is a naive realism that the world is just
stuff out there and our knowing it makes no difference to what it is. Well, again, we don't
have time for this, but how we attend something, whether we attend to it, even within the world
of physics, never mind in the world of philosophy and psychology, makes a difference to what we
are experiencing. And it's a moral act because it means that we are not simply observers in this
universe. We are creators in this universe. We co-create along with the universe and along with
that divine logos or Lee or Tao or whatever it is that is the ground of being. We are not just
passive consumers. Once again, it is always a reverberative relationship that I realize in my
very early teens that everything has this structure. And therefore, we have an impact on the world,
making it what it is, really literally making it what it is, the ways in which we see it,
alter what will be there. We know that from quantum mechanics, as it's laughably called,
or quantum field theory as I prefer, but it is also part of our experience of the world.
So how we see the world creates is a duty laid on us to pay the right kind of attention, a kind
of nourishing attention that brings things into being, not the kind of attention that alienates
and that cuts us off from that reality and therefore changes it and changes us. So it has
an effect on the world, it has an effect on us, those who are doing the attending, a moral effect.
You can make yourself a very dubious person by always adopting a stance of extreme
remoteness. You can also get things wrong by engulfing yourself in things. So as always,
it is a matter of finessing a harmony of positions that look opposed to one another,
but are equally necessary, or at least both necessary. So that's what I mean by it. And I
also mean that if we don't pay the right kind of attention to what we're doing in this world,
and the moment our attention is up for grabs from every kind of electronic device around us,
and I don't think that we are taught any longer how to be quiet and still and concentrate on a
piece of work, on reading or listening to a piece of music for an hour or two at a time,
if we don't reconnect with this kind of attention, we will lose the world.
Literally, I'm not speaking in metaphors, we will lose this world. The world may carry on without us,
but that would be very sad for certainly us and possibly for the world, because I,
I don't hate humanity. I think we've got things very, very badly wrong,
but what humanity is, is something very, very special.
Well, thank you. And all of humanity is indeed special. And the work you've done is certainly
very special. And I suppose on behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank you for your decades of
you know, scholarship, and the fire that has propelled that is something that I think we all
admire. And it's, you've done, I feel as though when I asked you earlier, you feel fulfilled
about your work, there's a sense in which you've clearly done with your talents what you alone
could do in some meaningful sense. And that's also why I wanted to share the biography. And I
think it's up to us as a broader population of people interested in your work, concerned about
the world in various ways, to consider what it means to us and how we bring it into being.
And with that in mind, we're going to move in that direction now,
beginning with, I'll pass over to my colleague, Michael Breddy in a second, and we'll do a very
short practice before we move into groups. And then we'll come back together,
where we'll have a chance to ask you questions, and I'll help to field them as well.
Okay, so this is a pretty fundamental question from Paul. Paul, do you want to ask it? If you're
there, can we see you and, or is that too much, too difficult, Michael, to do that?
I can actually, it might be a bit of a challenge, but I can.
All right, let me just ask it. If you don't mind, Paul, sorry, we better if we ask you. I hope you
understand. I think that's me. Okay, great. That's your friend Paul.
I know, thanks very much. And so my question relates to, how would you say that we could
slow down and nurture the sort of attention that
grows out of that slowing down in a world that seems to be speeding up and with less and less
time to sit for three hours with a piece of literature or enjoy, how do we reconcile the
speed of the world as we perceive it with the necessity of slowing down within it?
Thank you. Relatively quickly and just so we can get plenty of questions in.
Yes, which is a bit, I don't like to forward the question, but here we go.
It's a very good question. And I think it is difficult. There have never been more pressures
on people to do more things in less time. So the only thing I can suggest is that you stand out
against that culture as much as you can. And it's built into many of the assumptions of the culture
that it's better for everyone to be doing lots and lots of things. It might be better if we
did fewer things, but did them with greater thought and depth. So I think one has to
make some decisions. I mean, I'm not holding myself out as any kind of example of what to do.
I'm not a good example of doing anything. But I have no television. I've found myself
listening less and less to the radio. I hardly ever do actually listen to the radio, to be honest.
And I have switched off alerts when emails come. I try to limit the times of day in which I will
look at them. And I'm not on any of the social networks, but I have the luxury of a PA who
does and who therefore picks up messages for me. But if you haven't got such a person,
on the other hand, you might not have quite as many requests or questions.
But I think it is difficult. I think it's rather like asking any kind of spiritual
practitioner, how do you do this? And the answer is not some simple thing. But it's about embracing
a certain relation to the world. And that's really what I'm talking about. So I think it's
start from day one of thinking, you know, what matters is my relationship to the world,
to people and so on, and all the things that interrupt and make more shallow my connections
with them, my experiences, also more to be resisted. Sorry, it's not a very satisfactory
answer, but that's the best I can say. Thank you. And I'm looking at these, sorry,
Paul, thank you for your question. And I'm looking at these questions, all of which are
kind of explosive in their own way. One about AI, one about war and peace is one about God.
I want to be honest, I want to ask this, because it seems to me something that
Perspectiva recently did an anti-debate about as a whole conversation. But if you're interested,
look at the anti-debate. This is a question from Christine Miskelli. And it says,
in what sense might war be needed for the development of peace?
What sense, if any, perhaps? Well, gosh, it is a very good question.
I don't think it is absolutely necessary, though some degree of difference,
competition, conflict is also part of the process of collaboration. So I mean, one of the things I
say about the history of evolution, which is constantly projected as a simple warfare of all
against all is that it's not a bit like that. I mean, that it's far more distinguished by
collaboration and cooperation between species. But there's a degree of competition that's also
extremely healthful. And I suppose bringing it back to human war and peace, I would like to say,
I hope we can certainly avoid a war, but that nonetheless some degree of independence of states,
but working together of states is important. The element of change that comes about when
a country is plunged into a crisis can be extremely healthful. I mean, it's a bit of a cliche,
really, but it's true that the Second World War produced extraordinary advances in science and
technology, some of which may not be good in themselves, but some of which very clearly were
and have been used to great advantage. So once again, it's not all or nothing. But I hope that
in the case of actual human war, it will be as little as conceivably possible.
Okay, thank you, Ian. Gosh, there's so many. Do keep your questions coming just because we will
keep a record of all of these. So one way or the other, these will be attended to through a moral
act as it were. And we probably won't manage to answer all of them now. However, there was one
question that's very much of the moment. There is a more challenging real world question from
about AI from Pat Kane. Pat, do you want to frame that in your own vernacular?
Sure. Hi, Ian, I love your work. But I just this is a pressing question, which is to say,
you know, to what degree is computation a left brain phenomena? And what are the recent
achievements in computation, which are basically sort of modeling and building on the precedent of
a corpus? We all thought that machines, the one thing that machines wouldn't get anywhere near
would be creativity or responsibility. Maybe even that may be a more technical way to put it.
But it seems that's one of the first things that they've come for. We thought they would be
dealing with our routine eyes behaviors and liberating us from labor. What it seems to be
doing is coming in at the kind of formulaic nature of human creativity and intellect itself.
And that's that's what advanced AI has come to. Now, within the right brain, left brain,
complicated dynamic, which was Jonathan was at pains to say, is complex rather than Manachaean.
What's your perspective on advancing computation and what it does to our sense of appreciation
for valuing of the human? Wow. Well, first of all, to start with the with the rather limited
and more focused computation is a very left hemisphere element. And it's different from
understanding. So it's clear that the left hemisphere can manipulate words and manipulate
figures. But the right hemisphere is better able to understand the overall import of the words
and the overall nature of what has been computed and what it means. So in other words, it doesn't
have the degree of understanding of the right hemisphere, but it's able to carry out procedures.
It's the difference between procedures and inhabited processes. So what we're seeing is an
enormous it is striking and troubling, I agree. But if you get if you can compute so that you can
get all the possible permutations and possibilities, this is not the way the human mind works
intelligently. But you can then single out certain elements. But I doubt that
I may live to eat these words, but I doubt very much that a machine can can produce something
that is more than mediocre in terms of creativity. The business of creativity comes out of the
business of having a body, having a mortal life that is limited in extent, and having emotions.
And I think and being conscious, and there's no evidence that well, clearly that they don't have
bodies, they don't have emotions, but they could have consciousness. But I think that's a
doubtful but not not excludable possibility. But I don't think this is how great creative
works are made. There was already a machine created by putting all the works of Bach into it,
and then asking the machine to sort of out of this randomly, a new work of Bach. But the trouble
is that, although it could pass as in the genre of Bach, it's not created by a genius. And it
doesn't move one in the way that the works of Bach do and speak one in the way that the works of
Bach do. Only a human being a fellow sufferer can actually do that. Is that something to do in with
thanks for the question? Is it something to do with reverberation? I mean, you mentioned that
this notion that we have a similar problem in the chess world about whether a computer can play
a game. And there's something about seeing, feeling the other human beings creative acts
that is sort of non negligible, difficult to reproduce. And just you're so fond of the word
reverberation that that came to mind in that your response to the question. Well, there's no need
whatever for a computer that's very good at playing chess to have any form of consciousness.
I mean, that's just absolutely not required. All it has to do is do an immense amount of computing
very fast, which would be a very stupid thing to do, which is why I reject the term artificial
intelligence. It's not artificial intelligence. It's artificial information processing that can
be done incredibly fast, much faster than humans can process information. But my God, knowledge is
more than processing information. Understanding is more than knowledge and wisdom is more than
understanding. Okay, thank you. And you heard it here first. There's no such thing as AI. I'm
just kidding. So, Emmer, you had your photo, you had your hand up quite early. So you can go next,
please. Emmer Morrissey? Yeah. Hi. Yeah, it's Emmer. First, I just want to say a big thank you.
Your work has had a really profound impact on my life. So just to get that out of the way first.
Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the role of creativity,
because obviously, a creative act, for example, writing requires both hemispheres of the brain,
you know, like so the right would be kind of free flow of ideas and the left involved in the
editing process, for example. So I wanted to ask what you think the role of creativity could be
as an antidote to the imbalance that we see in the world?
I think it's terribly important. I mean, I think we are almost definable as creative beings. And
as you know, my philosophy is that we are here to help create reality that we are, you know,
we're not just passive passers-through of a slideshow, we are actually interacting with
something. So we are creating all the time. And emphasizing that element is important,
but it doesn't mean letting go of what the left hemisphere provides, which are the tools.
So for example, in order to be a good poet, you have to know your language, you have to understand
how it works, and you have to read a lot. In order to be a good composer, you have to
know the rules. Well, I think you do. I mean, nowadays, all the rules have been thrown out,
but it doesn't necessarily produce wonderful works of art. But I think that the composer
is at an advantage. Let me put it that way, if he or she understands the structures of music,
the nature of music, and the history of music. So I believe we create out of a living tradition
of which we are the new members who will take it in another way or take it further. That is all
brilliant. But what I reject is just cutting off the ways in which we might learn a skill.
Learning a skill, learning an art, learning a craft is very important for creativity. It doesn't
just happen by sticking people in a room and going bluer whatever comes out. That is not
needless to say how anything beautiful or gracious created. But I do think it is very
important. I absolutely agree with you. And I think that the way children are educated nowadays
is adversarial to that impulse. But again, I want to caution. I don't mean that they should just
be allowed to not learn things and let it all hang out. They really do need to get to grips
with things, understand them, but then allow to have their own thoughts, their own... That is
what my education was like all those millions of years ago in the dark ages when I was educated
by wonderful people who were excited about what they were talking about and didn't have to follow
a procedure that was sent to them from Whitehall. We need to get back to a business of openness
and that the mind of the young person needs to be trained to think differently, not just to
be indoctrinated. This is what you must say. And if you don't say these things,
you won't get full marks. But no, think for yourself. Turn things on their head. See what
happens. It's great. Okay. Thank you so much. And listen, we're going to have a question from
Four Arrows, which you've raised a few interesting comments throughout the evening and a chance to
ask Ian directly. Ian, I'll let Four Arrows answer the question, but just so you know what my
interest here is something about the nature of hierarchy that's implicit both in, or actually
quite explicit in the master and his emissary, but also to some extent in the myth with which
you begin the second volume of the new book. And I think this is a question that's sort of
challenging that to some extent. Can we hear Four Arrows if he's there? Yeah, I'm just asking,
I'm wondering if Four Arrows could raise their hand, then it's much easier for me to find Four
Arrows because we have so many people here. Also known as Don Trent Jacobs, PhD. Here,
I see you now in Four Arrows. Okay, here we go. There we go. You found me.
I'm a big fan of yours, Ian, on many levels. As an indigenous scholar, I appreciate your
references to the Uroquois Confederacy as a model also. I have a question that is,
you're in that metaphor that Jonathan just described. I just want to be clear
that you didn't intend for that relationship of hierarchy to the need to be permanent in order
to recognize that each person has limitations. And in the indigenous approach, of course,
hierarchy is contextual. For the buffalo hunt, we'll have a leader, but otherwise,
it's matriarchal and non. So can you clarify what you meant by that using that particular
analogy because it was a little bothersome. Okay. Well, have you come across the myth that I use?
Have you read it? Yes, I have come across it. I disagree with it in a way.
Explicit in it is that there are these two unequal powers, and one is able to be creative
and is able to look after the other one that can do good as long as it's under the
supervision of the greater power. There are two unequal twin brothers.
Just to be clear about the question, as I understand it, it's not, that's not in doubt,
and I think that's even accepted. It's just about the permanence of that relationship and
whether the hierarchy is a fluid notion that comes and goes according to context, or whether
it's... Well, in that myth, it isn't. No, in that myth, it is a permanent fact about the
relationship. It's never hinted that the other brother can somehow be the leader because he
just doesn't have what it takes. He on his own would be dangerous and his attempts to create a
negative. And he's jealous of, envious of his brother's position. He's a rival that is an
upstart, basically. This is the same as the story of Lucifer, the brightest of the angels,
who became Satan. And the whole story of Paradise Lost is caused by the resentment
of the one that can't do what the other one can do. Now, it's a very dangerous human reality,
and I wouldn't wish to gloss over it at all. I think the interpretation is incorrect. It's a
Western lens through which that myth is taught. And so Joseph Campbell actually talks about that
myth in a different way. I take it from Joseph Campbell. I take it direct from Joseph Campbell.
Well, then we should have a conversation about that disagree with them, right?
Yeah, because the twin heroes, the twin heroes is the key, and the twin heroes, which can...
That mythology is that these twins work in complementarity with different strengths
and recognize the different interpretations in different contexts. And so that's why I like
what Jonathan is trying to clarify in terms of the fluidity. One more brief other one. I use the
left and right brain here also. I use it all the time. That's the problem with our world,
exactly what you're saying. But science really calls our metaphor a myth. And indeed, it is more
complex. Can you tell how you are still using that idea of left brain here in the sphere
without getting too shot down by neuroscience? And then I'll close.
I think Ian, briefly on that, because we have several questions.
Yeah. Well, gosh, how can I be brief? I think, first of all, that a myth is not an untrue,
but it is a way in which the greatest truths can be expressed. And they can only be expressed
from metaphors, poetry, myth, and ritual. And therefore, these things are very important
elements in language. They're not the stuff of science. That's not a criticism of science.
Science starts out by excluding them. So that's fine. And what I've said is very
bust in neuroscience terms, and nobody has really said that it isn't.
Nobody with any authority has ever explained to me that there's anything wrong with it.
So thank you, Ian. And we're almost at the end, but there's one final question. I just want to let
people know that your questions have been seen. Some of them are wonderful that we can't answer.
So do know that they're appreciated. We'll keep a record of them. We may even use them in some
other contexts. But there is a very direct question to end with, Ian. And I hope you don't
mind. It's from Malband. And it simply says, how do you understand God?
Oh, that's, we have minus 15 seconds for me to answer.
It's all about the resistance and all that. So I wrote a 106 page chapter, which is woefully
short on it. I can't answer that. In fact, the only decent thing to say is it can't be put into
words, certainly not into the sort of expression you would like. So sorry to disappoint you,
but actually that is the best expression of what I can say about it.
Okay. And the bell. The bell is the answer also. Wonderful.
So listen, there are more questions. I see your hands up. I know there are. But there's
all the good to leave once again more. And there is more to come. This is the first of several
in this series. I'll be kind of anchoring most of these conversations, but there will be other
people speaking to Ian at more length from different vantage points, exploring different
aspects of both the books, getting a clearer sense of what we mean by attention being a moral act.
So I do hope many of you will come back. A reminder to we'll be in touch tomorrow and to
encourage you to sign up to Perspectiva's mailing list so you can hear about this series and the
other work that we do. And also again, that we are a charity we rely on philanthropic donations.
If any of you feel so inclined, you're very welcome to follow the link that we gave earlier
in the chat or that you can find on our website to make us a donation or sign up for a subscription.
It's much appreciated. And the next event in two weeks time is with Zach Stein, a sort of
philosopher of education, really brilliant guy who I've known for several years now. He's the
author of a book called Education in a Time Between Worlds. And he is going to be asking Ian about
many things, but principally this notion of the direct perception of value in the world,
what it's sometimes called value-ception. And they'll be getting deep into what that means
and why it matters today especially. And there'll be other subsequent talks, but that's the next one.
So I think unless I've forgotten something, we're good to go as it were.
Yeah, if I could just give a reminder, Jonathan, but next week we have a connection to the inquiry
session, which Ian won't be present at sadly, but it's more focused on connecting with the
people that have been here tonight and others in structured breakout rooms and different practices
to explore these ideas in greater depth. So to really kind of find the others and to create
a space for that. And it will be directly related to what's been discussed tonight.
So yeah, if you can make that, I put the link in the chat to register for that,
but I'll just stick it in again. And also what I'll do is just put in the link for the main
kind of webpage where we're going to host, make announcements for all of the sessions
as they come up. So if you're, you know, when you want to check back in, you can just go to
that link and you'll see what the next sessions that come up and register for all the upcoming events.
Great. Well, listen, Ian, as always, a huge thank you. I hope this is the first of many of these,
well, I know I hope it will be first of many of these conversations. And
thanks for everyone for coming and staying and your questions. And sorry, we couldn't get to
them all. And I hope now that those who want to copy the chat have done so. And we'll see you,
most of you, hopefully in a couple of weeks, maybe even in one week, if you're joining Michael
and Lee for the Connection and Inquiry session, which I encourage you to do because like,
it's good to talk, right? I mean, this is heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy chat, this stuff. So it's good
to be with others who are wrestling with it too, and share your life experience and how this work
comes into your world, to be a little bit less alone and maybe a bit more creative and productive
through that. So pleasure to see you all, and we'll see you very soon. Bye for now.
Bye. Thank you.
Thanks, Ian. Be in touch soon. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you. Thanks, Jonathan. Pleasure.
