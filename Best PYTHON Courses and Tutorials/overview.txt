1. **Setup Proxy Configuration**: You need to set up a proxy configuration in your server's `engine-x` configuration file. This involves editing the configuration file and ensuring that the proxy settings are correctly configured, including handling WebSockets.

2. **Verify Configuration**: After setting up the proxy, you should verify that your server is running correctly by accessing it through a web browser (e.g., `localhost:8080`). If the configuration has errors, they might be indicated in the terminal when you try to launch the server.

3. **Correct Typo**: If you encounter an error related to `remote_add`, make sure that you have the correct command, which should be `remote add`.

4. **Clear Cache**: If your web browser is showing cached content instead of the updated server content, clear the cache to see the changes.

5. **Test WebSocket Forwarding**: To ensure that the WebSockets are working correctly, you can run a test notebook (e.g., `test1.ipynb`) that sends messages through the WebSocket connection. If the notebook executes successfully, it confirms that the WebSockets are forwarding as expected.

6. **Optimize Jupyter Hub Instance**: To speed up your Jupyter Hub instance, you can intercept requests for static assets and serve them directly from a local copy of the notebook repository cloned onto your computer.

7. **Set Up Static Asset Serving**: In the Atom editor (or another code editor), modify the `engine-x` configuration file to add a new block that recognizes requests for static assets using a regular expression. This block should point to the directory where you have cloned the notebook repository containing the static files.

8. **Restart Engine X**: If Engine X is running, stop it and then start it again to ensure the new configuration for static assets takes effect.

9. **Verify Static Asset Serving**: Use a web browser to navigate back to the root page of your server. The static assets (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files) should now be served directly from the local copy on your computer, hosted by Engine X.

10. **Summary**: You've set up a proxy configuration for JupyterHub with Engine X, verified that it's working by accessing it via a web browser, corrected a typo in the remote configuration, ensured that your browser cache is cleared, tested WebSocket forwarding, optimized your JupyterHub instance by serving static assets directly from your local notebook repository, and confirmed that the static assets are being served correctly.
