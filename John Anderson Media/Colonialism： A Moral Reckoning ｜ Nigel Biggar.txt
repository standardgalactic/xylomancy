Colonial government never sought to perpetuate genocide, and on the contrary,
a colonial government strove to moderate the impact of settlers on natives, particularly in the 1800s,
after there had been this kind of moral revolution in England.
And again, evangelical Christianity was a major force here.
Colonial government tried to moderate the impact of settlers on natives,
and that strove to restrain violence.
Nigel Bigger, who I count a friend and has been with us on this program before,
is Emeritus Regis Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford.
His most recent book is Colonialism, A Moral Reckoning.
Nigel, thank you so much for joining us.
My pleasure to be back again, John.
Now, the many things that someone with your extensive list of qualifications
and background could have chosen to do, you've written a book about colonialism.
Why? And you argue that is not the original sin, as some people say,
it is of countries like Britain.
So, John, that's a good question.
And the first thing I'd say is, I've been reading, although I'm a theologian
and an ethicist professionally, my first love was always history,
and my preferred reading is history.
And I've been reading about, in particular, British imperial history for 20, 30 years.
And so, in recent times, when some people say that the British Empire, for example,
was nothing but a litany of racism and economic exploitation and wanton violence,
I say to myself, well, it was all those things, but it was also the opposite.
So, part of the reason for writing the book was to inform a new generation of
Britons and Australians and Canadians and New Zealanders about the whole truth
about their colonial past, not just the politically partisan story.
So, that was one reason.
A second reason has to do with the fact that I'm actually Anglo-Scottish.
I know don't sound like it.
I sound only marginally more Scottish than you do, John.
But I was born there.
And if you get me to say a word like Jerusalem, then it comes out.
But otherwise, I sound English.
But what that meant was that when the referendum on Scottish independence was held in 2014,
I was an abyssal, anti-independence person because I've lived on both sides of the border
and I actually think the UK is important and valuable and it's important to keep it together.
But I noticed that some Scottish nationalists were justifying Scottish independence as a form
of kind of national self-purification in terms of Britain equals empire equals evil
and Scotland's separation from Britain and Britain's the UK's disillusion would be an
act of kind of national self-purification.
And again, I thought to myself, well, that's just far too simplistic and as it stands,
it's just not true.
And then more recently, particularly since the killing of George Floyd in 2020 in Minneapolis
and the Black Lives Matter movement coming across the Atlantic here,
we've had an obsession with colonialism and British colonialism in particular.
And I've noticed that empire has been a feature of human history since almost the dawn of time.
People with non-white skins, Arabs, Indians, Comanche and others were doing empire long
before Europeans did it.
Why the obsession with European empires?
Why the fixation on British empire?
And I interpret it as being an assault on the record of the West.
So for all those reasons, partly historical, then in domestically, British, political and
then more broadly international politics, I wanted to write this book and to put the
record straight.
It's a courageous thing to do because we live in such a sensorial age and to defend Western
culture seems to be to invite, disdain and even cancellation.
I understand you even had a bit of trouble with your publisher or proposed publisher.
Yes, I did.
I was offered a contract to write what was then called An Intelligent Person's Guide
to Colonialism by Bloomsbury Publishing in spring of 2018.
I produced the manuscript at the end of 2020.
The deadline was 31st of December.
I produced it at two o'clock on the 31st of December and my commission editor read it
and in January he wrote back saying he was speechless with admiration at its rigor and
comprehensiveness.
He said it was an important book and he predicted it would sell up to 20,000 copies
and then it went into the copy editing process and they produced a cover but then in March
I got an email from the top of Bloomsbury saying that they were going to postpone publication
indefinitely because, to use their words, public feeling is unfavorable and I was told
informally they wanted me to walk away from my contract.
I could go into the gory detail, I'll spare you.
It's suffice to say that eventually I, because I had no other choice, I agreed to walk away
from the contract without any other publisher in sight.
That was in April 2021.
Happily in August 2021 William Collins came to my rescue and they published the book
in this country and in Australia I think in early February and it came out in Canada
and the States last week.
Well, I don't know what's happened to the idea that we ought to have public debates,
contestability of ideas, attempts to get to the truth of things but I find it a very,
very disturbing development.
No, it was and of course when I realised they weren't going to publish it I was momentarily
depressed, partly for personal reasons but most of all what depressed me was the thought
that we in Britain had come to the place where judging by what other people have said of my
work, John, I'm pretty careful and I'm pretty thorough and this topic was really important
and my commission editor said it was one of the most important books he'd seen in years
and yet it seemed that this British publisher wouldn't publish it because
public feeling was unfavorable.
Now of course we all know that public feeling is many things, there are many public feelings but
part of the market, this publisher, was scared of offending and what that implied for the
future of liberal, a kind of liberal free open society in this country really depressed me.
It's funny the little moments that make you stop and think it's not as straightforward
as the public mantra might have you believe.
Seven or eight years ago I had occasion to spend some time in Myanmar, one time Burma.
I met a very old man there who said you know I'm close to the end of my life, I've seen 90 years
or so and only one year of my 90 did I feel safe and free in my own country and I said
when was that? 1946 he said before that we had Japanese imperialism suffocating us, the war.
1946 we were liberated and the British ran the place for a year and I felt good and I felt safe
and then my own people forced a repressive regime on me.
These things are always much more complicated, much more nuanced, always a story of good and bad
and that takes a lot of unpacking but can I ask you, let's be clear what you're talking about,
your book is a scrutiny of our current moral evaluations of colonialism, what would you
describe as the colonialism that you're writing about and what sort of main countries have you
sought to focus on? So let me start with empire first of all before I talk about colonialism.
So empire is a form of political organization which has existed since the dawn of time whereby
in an empire there are many peoples but one people dominates, roughly speaking that's an empire.
Now colonies are a form the empire can sometimes take when the dominant people
emigrate to other parts of the world and settle. So you have European British colonists in Australia,
you have European British colonists in North America, you don't have European British colonists
much in India during the British Empire. So there's a distinction between empire and colonies
but broadly speaking and I've used the word colonialism in the title of my book because
that's the one that's used in public discourse but the book itself focuses on the record of the
British Empire. Why? Partly it's the one I know best, partly it was the largest of the European
empires and it's also the one that morphed to some extent into the post-Nahifa 5 American-led
international order and so when I said earlier that I think that the attack on colonialism,
the attack on the British Empire is an attack on the record of the west that's one reason why I
focused on it. One of the early claims you make in the book is that the colonial or so-called
colonial project was made up of both good and bad motives. No the common narrative would be that
there couldn't possibly have been any good motives. I'd appreciate your views on that
preface of briefly by saying not long ago I met an Indian scholar who said to me that much of what
happened in India was very positive which is surprising it's not what young people particularly
will ever hear. How can there be good motives? No indeed indeed. Yes you're right so the assumption
is that empire is always about conquest and oppression and exploitation but that was much
more of a theory than it does to historical fact so that's one reason why I prefer not to talk about
imperialism or colonialism because that implies a kind of unitary thing whereas in fact I mean
maybe in Berlin in 1938 someone decided we're going to conquer the world but in the case of the
British Empire and most of the European emperors it wasn't like that it was much more ad hoc much
more responding to circumstance. So how did the British Empire rise? Originally in the 1600s
trade. East India Company is given a monopoly of trade between England and India and Englishmen
sail out to India and establish trading bases in India. Then Englishmen also go westward across
the Atlantic why do they do that? Well partly because Elizabeth first wanted her sailors to
harass Spanish shipping because the Spanish Empire was threatening to protest in England so the irony
there is the origins of English Empire are anti-imperial but to be honest also people like Drake and
others were hungry for gold and at the time I don't think they were particularly hungry for land
but they were hungry for gold so you've got those in the early century of the first British Empire
you have trade anti-imperial national endeavour private hunger for gold. Later on in the 19th
century the British one reason the British ever came to rule East Africa was lobbying by
humanitarians to suppress the slave the Arab slave trade and some parts of the empire landed
in London at the end of wars when they were ceded by treaty. So the motives were really quite
various yes they included sometimes greed they included sometimes racial arrogance but
oftentimes I mean all human endeavour is a mixture of of virtue and vice and good motives and bad
anyone reflecting on their own private lives knows that and imperial endeavour was no different
you know we have lost sight of that haven't we I mean we now tend to ascribe virtue
to one group versus another group yes in a very simplistic way you disagree with me
so you're bad and you're all bad and I'm all right and there's no allowing for the
grainness in between and I think that's right and I mean I speak as a Christian
the assumption that virtue and vice runs right through the middle of me is one I long
made and I assume of everyone else that we're a mixture of virtue and vice it
one one good effect of that view of the universality of sinfulness is that when you do me wrong John
I may be very annoyed and I may rightly hold you account hold you to account for that but
the fact that I know that I too am a sinner means that my my judgement on you is tempered
because I too am a sinner and so it the sense that unrighteousness is within here as well as out
there actually helps to temper conflict between individuals and between political parties and
between nations and frankly a wider awareness of that that wisdom now might see a greater
commitment to a more honest debate about issues of the thought that we're talking today I think so
now you say that colonialism can be said to have a report card that that shows some positives
as well as some negatives what are the negatives firstly as you said yeah so
just taking the British Empire for example in the debit column of the imperial ledger
you will find roughly 150 years worth of slave trade and and slavery from about 1650 to 1807
you will find not uncommonly offensive racial arrogance you also find very commonly the abrupt
disruption of social and the social and cultural and economic lives of native peoples in North
America Australia and Africa the reason for that is that the the the cultural gap between
let's say 19th century Europeans with their science and their medicine and their ocean
going ships and their firearms the culture gap between them and many peoples they met was just
vast so so the impact of modernity which was going to happen one way or another was was
severe and the other major negative impact of European colonial expansion was disease
Europeans had been I don't understand these things not not being a medic but I understand that
because Europeans had domesticated animals they had become immune to diseases that animals can
spread but when they went to North America and not least Australia they brought with them
diseases that native peoples were not immune to and native people suffered grievously that said
there is reason to suppose that smallpox was introduced to northern Australia not by Europeans
but by fishermen from what's now Indonesia so it wasn't just the Europeans who spread disease and
by the way the disease were not spread deliberately but it was it was a tragic evil amongst the
widely presented arguments that colonialism was was was evil as of course that it was racist
but I think you challenge that assumption it's not so simple and indeed you hold up the very
interesting illustration of British involvement in Africa to end slavery which is deeply rooted
in the horrors of racism yeah so I I think we we need to have an adult discussion about what
we mean by racism John and I there are a couple of pages in my book where I I lay out what I
think racism is and I I take it to be I mean human beings are constantly in the business
of identifying with one group over and against another and thinking themselves thinking this
group to which I belong this football club this church this nation this race is better than another
because it it it makes us feel better to be superior to other people it's a very common thing
Europeans did not invent racial prejudice but I think that's that's what it is it's it's it's
denigrating another people another race in an indiscriminate fashion and then assuming that any
member of that race shares and whatever bad qualities you attributed to it and that that I regard
just for the record is is ugly and it's abhorrent but what I don't think is racist is is making
discriminate judgments about another culture and saying well in this respect I think that
culture is scientifically or technologically or perhaps even morally inferior now why do I say
that's not not racist well it's partly because you know when I was a 21st century britain
looked back on my medieval forebears you bet there are ways in which I regard our culture of superior
to theirs you know we don't thank goodness hang draw on quarter criminals we don't burn them alive
our medicine is superior our agriculture is superior so if I can say that about about my
own people a thousand years ago if I meet other cultures around the world which have
similar practices or a similar level of cultural development I also regard them as in these respects
inferior and let's also point out that people who regard regard themselves as progressive
when they regard let's say christian fundamentalists in in the southern united states they regard them
typically with contempt so they regard their progressive culture superior to to fundamentalist
christian culture so my view is that needn't be racist provided you discriminate you're not
you're not as it were indiscriminately rubbishing of another culture and the other important respect
is this that it would be racist as some people toward the end of the 1800s thought to regard
non-white peoples as naturally or biologically inferior let's just say not only are they
at this moment in time inferior culturally in certain respects but that's because they are
naturally inferior and they will never significantly improve that view as I said was around in the
late victorian period but it never displaced the earlier christian view and this is the view that
um fueled the very powerful and popular movement to abolish slavery which which grew
gain momentum in the late 1700s the christian view that all human beings are basically equal
under god regardless of race and regardless of cultural development and that view I don't that
that view is not racist the the worst form of racism I think is that which regards uh uh
members of another race as naturally and permanently and biologically inferior that's
insupportable I'm often reminded in my own mind of the the earliest recognised
political slogan that was struck by Josiah Wedgwood during the anti-slavery campaign
you can still see examples of it everywhere a very intricate beautifully made bas-relief of
an african man looking imploringly up and the slogan underneath says am I not a man and a brother
yes yeah insistence yes that our humanity is common yes and they're not in inferior spaces
yeah so it was that christian view that that you'll find it at the beginning of John Wesley's
thoughts upon slavery in 774 and it was that christian view that particularly through evangelical
christianity through methodism through non-conformist christianity really became widespread in england in
the late 17 early 1800s in america in canada new zealand in my own home country australia the
dispossession of native peoples still widely discussed in terms of not only being a terrible
thing but sometimes there's the hint that it was genocidal that there was the intent to wipe out a
people does a proper reading of a historical record support such a contention that there was
somehow a premeditated intention to do away with people on the basis of race in my view no i mean
the the as you well know the the classic alleged example of genocide was what happened in tasmania
in the 1830s and 40s the the australian art critic robert hugh said that was the that was kind of
the one infamous example of genocide within within the british empire this of course is highly
controversial but my view that what what happened in tasmania is not fairly described as genocide
is shared by australian historians such as henry reynolds and duke moses who rightly i think
certainly reynolds rightly says that we need to define genocide as international law defines it
namely as an intentional and systematic attempt to exterminate a people i mean the paradigm of
genocide is of course hitler's final solution you know very deliberate state sponsored state
organized and very systematic that's the paradigm and nothing like that happened in in Tasmania
nor anywhere else in the british empire that's not to say that there weren't settlers who were so
hostile to native peoples that when they encountered them they tried to kill as many as they could
um but from my reading of australian new zealand
african and north american history uh colonial government never sought to perpetrate genocide
and on the contrary a colonial government strove to moderate the impact of settlers on natives
particularly in the 1800s after they'd been this kind of moral revolution in england and again
evangelical christianity was was a major force here colonial government tried to moderate the
impact of settlers on on natives and strove to to to restrain violence um and to to restrain
settler violence um so there was there was no uh systematic state sponsored attempt at
exterminating a people although peoples were sometimes annihilated um almost invariably
by disease so that the bayo took people of newfoundland and in what's now canada in the 1700s
disappeared through a combination of disease warfare with other tribes um and the impact of
europeans but again it wasn't it wasn't deliberate it's an important distinction to make i think
between the actions of individuals and what was sanctioned by the state and what was not
so i think of a horrendous massacre that happened not far from where i live uh
and it was undertaken by a group of highly irresponsible and very nasty stockman yes
the state apparatus if i can put it that way slowly and in a pretty creaking way nonetheless
actually assisted on justice yes and nine perpetrators out of 11 people involved white
men were hung for what they had done uh quite early on so the state in a sense yes often not
as effectively as it might have but it did seek in that case to insist on justice to recognize
that a white man and this is the language that was sort of being used at the time
who murdered a black man should hang for it yes so i think there's a isn't there are a cartoon
that governor ather had put about which was explaining in in cartoon form to to Aboriginal
people that that um there'll be equal justice that if a white man kills an aborigine yes they
they tool that's correct yeah but just just on that um my my perception is that
in Australia and elsewhere um if there was something to criticize about
colonial government it was it was too weak it wasn't powerful enough to control what was going on
but but then i think we need to remember that um government in in early 19th century Britain
was small and weak so so when you've got famine in Ireland just across across the Irish sea
part of the problem is the the the government doesn't have the resources
to to deal with that problem adequately um and just in terms of personnel i think around
even as late as the 1880s in Canada um you have 1000 royal Canadian mounted police
patrolling um the whole of of Canada 1000 men this vast territory um so so and i suspect in
Australia it was the same story that they simply weren't the government didn't have the personnel
the army the police uh sufficient to to control what was going on in the frontiers but they did
their best no you can't talk about the British empire without considering India and it's an
interesting case it's a rising superpower it's becoming the most populous nation on earth
it's a little uncertain in its democracy at times but it is a democracy and i often think to myself
that it may not have been a democracy if Britain had not in the end shown them what
democracy was the record's not all bad they could have left a complete shambles and a dysfunctional
state yes um so what did the British do for for India first of all they created it because when
the British arrived in India in the subcontinent in the 1700s it was a a mosaic of different states
different princely states um speaking a variety of languages and by the time the British left in
1947 sadly British India was divided into Pakistan and India because because of religious tensions
but what was left of India was was a very large unitary state in which English was widely spoken
at least at certain levels so there was a linguistic coherence and so so insofar as India now is
thriving economically the fact that there is a common language and a common state and a common
market must bear some large responsibility for that but also in in terms of the the the rule of
of law i mean the Indian civil service under the British had reputation for very high integrity
and i don't know i don't know to what extent the Indian civil service as it is now has
maintained that tradition but if you want conditions for that are attractive to investors then the
rule of law a lack of corruption in government a large common market and a common language
English helps enormously is very attractive so although it's true that you know the the current
vigor of the Indian economy knows a lot to the abandonment of socialist policies which the
immediate post independence Indian governments adopted nevertheless the thing the British
put in place that that provide conditions for a vigorous economic life and it does raise the
question i think as well you often hear this story this line that the west is responsible for the
dysfunctionality of former colonies today and it overlooks often what those countries or
or conglomeration of communities which India was i suppose what they were really like
in terms of functionality yes prior to yes the involvement of the west i mean what one of the
the general benefits of imperial authority is that it pacifies what would otherwise be
a multiplicity of warring peoples and that was certainly the case in India when the East India
Company first began would first landed there Mughal imperial authority had disintegrated
and there was constant civil wars among Indians and one of the effects of the
of the expansion of the rule of the East India Company in the late 1700s was peace
and as a consequence of of peace economic prosperity so if it one one person i
quote in in my book John Malcolm Scotsman born about 50 miles east of where i was born in fact
he he was a founder member of the club in which we now sit he wrote he went out to India in about
1780 at the age of 13 and in the around around 1800 he he he wrote about how
because of the the ending of civil war and the imposition of British rule
the peasants were returning to the fields and they were coming fertile again
so the imperial imposed peace has as the as the the benefit of allowing economic life to flourish
and and that was one of the benefits of the imposition of British imperial rule in in India
there's an interesting counter example in southern Africa when in 1879 the British invaded and
conquered the Zulu kingdom and in order to break up its power because it was it was a
highly militarized society the British broke up the Zulu kingdom into about a dozen different
little kinglets and sometime afterwards the some Zulu leaders were heard to complain
and they said you know you British you conquered us we get the right of conquest fine you you get to
rule us now would you please do so because what you've done is you come here you've conquered us
you've broken us up and because you haven't imposed your imperial authority we're now quarreling
among one another so so again sometimes the the fault of imperial rule was it was sometimes too
weak but when it's when it's imposed it has the benefit of of creating peace and and as a consequence
of that economic prosperity central to any account of colonialism is surely the importation of
missionaries and Christianity to non-Christian lands what did you discover in your research in
this area about the relationship between Christianity and missionaries and colonialization
so you write John that that Christianity became important for the empire around the end of the
1700s early 1800s because of the evangelical awakening in England and that that fueled the
movement for the abolition of slavery and then it fueled concern for the plight of
native peoples in in likes of Australia and North America so in that sense it was it became
a central and important humanizing feature but in one sense early on
contrary to to to one myth about colonialism missionaries were not central to the project because
colonial officials often found missionaries to be a nuisance why were they nuisance well
because if you are christian missionaries into India for example and they start to to proselytize
and preach the gospel then then Indians get upset and the colonial officials then have to deal with
with the with the upset so in fact the East India Company banned missionaries until about the 1830s
so it's not true to say that that christian missionaries were simply the lapdog dogs are the tool of
of empire far from it and often you'd find missionaries in New Zealand or Africa and indeed
Canada lobbying the imperial government in London to constrain the actions of colonial
governments in in in the colonies so missionaries could be pains in the backside to colonial
governments because they were critical and often humanitarian now it's often it's sometimes often
thought that missionaries pushed christianity down the throats of of natives well that wasn't
true because missionaries didn't have the power to do that it is true sadly for example in the
residential schools in in Canada where native children were brought so they could learn English
and agriculture it is true that sometimes missionaries were christian missionaries were too zealous
and too dismissive of native culture so there was an element of cultural racism there not always but
sometimes but often native peoples found christianity attractive so Ronald Hyam who's a was a an
historian of the British Empire writes that in Africa the christian message of the brotherhood of
humanity and equality in Christ that was naturally enormously attractive to people in the African
margins young people women trying young women trying to avoid female circumcision slaves and
others and and so native people sometimes found christianity very attractive they adapted it
they adopted it but they also you know what they what they adopted they also changed and adapted so
african christianity found african expression for for christianity too so the the the relationship
between christianity and native peoples was was a very mixed one and also between colonial
authorities and missions was a very mixed one but it's certainly not true to think of of christian
missions as simply an extension of colonial oppression that's far too simplistic what do we
know about the distinctive approaches to colonisation by the different nations that engaged in it well
it wasn't just the british the french the spanish the dutch the germans they had different approaches
there were different outcomes what did you find there and what were the driving influences for
their different approaches yes um to be frank john i i i don't i can't claim to know enough about
other european empires i know something um so you know if you're an expert um comparison go to
quichan kumar's book visions of empire um a very good book published about eight years ago
but here here are some things i have picked up um i think on the on the negative side i think
the british were more reluctant to allow native peoples and native elites into the top echelons
of government so in india for example um yes indians were involved in in governing other indians
but not not right at the top i have the impression the french in africa were better at at integrating
elites into the top and in that respect i think the french did better um on the other hand uh the
british tended to adhere to the the liberal principle that colonies should become increasingly
independent and as as you well know partly because the british learned from the american
war of independence you can't keep tight control of colonies at the far end of the world particularly
when you take months to communicate with them and so starting with canada in the sixties and then
australia new zealand south africa by the 1930s are virtually independent and they have i think
common some common defense policies um and india's on the same track after the after the first world
war uh so the the model of the the british model of empire was really a kind of relaxing into a
commonwealth of nations and that that phrase is used as early as the first world war uh whereas the
french um had a model of of as it were integrating the colonies into france and so to this day
french overseas territories have send representatives to the asomble and asian al in in in france so
that that was another another difference and then a third point would be um you know whereas the
british decided to devote their imperial power in part to the abolition of slavery all over the
world so uh yes the british were involved in slave trading slavery from 1650 to about to the
1800s but then from the early 1800s onwards the empire for the second half of its life
was committed to abolishing slavery from brazil across africa india and malaysia and that also
included um um abolishing slavery in south africa which the british took over from the dutch
um around 1804 i think uh because the dutch had been importing slaves from malaysia into
africa and for for that reason um um some dutch africaners or became known as boers many farmer
they were so upset at the british suppression of slavery that they left cape colony which the
british controlled and created their own african republics the transvaal and the orange free state
uh so on that point um dutch colonists and british uh british colonialism differed uh in in terms
of the treatment of of native africans and that was why when the second anglobal war broke out in
1899 black africans as well as black african americans tended to support the british i think
there's often an assumption that colonization involved great cruelty and violence um that it
was about military takeovers if you like and the squashing of people i don't think it's as simple as
that i think as you've said there were various motives various different approaches taken at
various times by the british but i also wonder whether the sort of policies that different
countries ran reflected different ideas about treating indigenous people decently yes so um
there's no doubt john that um in the history of the british empire there's a lot of violence
but we need to put that in context because um you and i are privileged to live in parts of the world
that enjoy unprecedented peace and health and wealth and security and we we live in countries that
have strong states that can afford to be very careful about how much violence they use because
they don't have to use too much of it but in in the past where states uh colonial governments
are weak where borders are uncertain um there was a lot of conflict a lot of violence um
but that's the the past was just it was much more insecure and where people are insecure they are
they don't give other benefit of doubt and it's more violent so let's just take that as red
um how did the british empire compare to other empires in terms of violence well
to take one infamous case you've got the belgian empire in the congo which
colony in the congo which uh was notoriously cruel to black africans although to be fair as i
understand it um that wasn't actually a colony of the belgian state it was actually a private
fiefdom of of king leopold um so you might want to say that wasn't the belgian sport which is the
kings that's that's a fine point um then the other um allegedly notoriously uh uh cruel
expression of european colonialism was uh in german south east africa uh where it is widely
supposed that the Germans perpetrated a genocide there now that's controversial i have a a
colleague and friend to the right of me bruce gilly who was argued forcefully that that wasn't the
case but it's widely held to be the case um and then you've got um the japanese um in uh when they
invaded china famously the rape of nanjing or nanking um where no one knows how many but
several hundred thousand chinese civilians were killed by japanese troops and it is notable
therefore that um in the second world war um probably the greatest yes without a doubt the
greatest number of troops in the british empire were indian and indian troops were all volunteers
and uh although indian troops were deployed in north africa and in in in italy during the
second world war most of them were fighting the japanese and berma and india and they chose
to fight with the british against the japanese why not because they wanted the british to stay in
rule rule them forever um but they sure as damn didn't want the japanese to rule them because they
they read the papers they heard the reports of what the japanese did in in uh in china in manchuria
and um compared to the japanese the british uh were to indians at that time are far preferable
uh and as i've said uh as we as we discussed earlier i don't think the british were responsible
for perpetrating genocide in tasmania or anywhere else uh whereas it seems that um
in some cases european empires did commit genocide
so we hear endlessly that there are endless negatives about what britain in particular
has done in the rest of the world in the name of colonialism uh and you've been very honest about
some of those failings can we get a handle on the good news the positives as you discover them to be
yeah so in the conclusion to my book i i draw up two lists of i draw up as it were the the
debat column in the ledger and then the credit column the credit column is actually longer
um so here are some of the items in the credit ledger we talked about anti-slavery and this was a
consistent policy uh for 150 years for the second half of the empire's life
um uh there was also the the imposition of peace i've mentioned uh um native peoples did did benefit
from the imposition of imperial authority which subdued warfare between between uh natives
there was also the um the establishment of the rule of law um i was in shanghai and
china a few years ago and met a a young couple from singapore and as soon as daniel had reduced
himself to me he said without any prompting he said we in singapore are grateful to you british
for the rule of law and uh another anecdote i have related to that is um i had a a colleague from
a chinese colleague from hong kong visiting me in in oxford and um i said to him so
ping chung um what do you what do you what do you think about the british legacy the colonel
legacy in hong kong and he said well you know if if in the um 1950s or 60s china had been a liberal
democracy hong kong wouldn't look so good but in the 50s late 50s early 50s um china was in a state
of anarchy and civil war and that's why you had a million or two chinese no one knows how many
fleeing mainland china coming into the non-democratic colony of hong kong
why because at least there at least there there was the rule of law which provides life with
predictability and you can at least um have sufficient stability to to flourish there so the
establishment of the rule of law was really important very important for foreign investment
the british up until 1929 um i think invested more overseas than any other european country
and investors don't invest unless the environment is secure but otherwise they risk losing their
investment so british the establishment of rule of law stable government encouraged investment
in india and africa and australia and north america and not least thanks to that
look at what uh the british empire uh grew up so the united states um canada australia
new zealand and indeed israel uh some of the most uh prosperous stable liberal countries in the world
all of them uh were progeny of the british empire um so i think there are there are quite a large
number of of benefits that the empire uh conferred upon various parts of the world
here's a novel thought there are probably not a few people who wouldn't mind a little british
rule of law today yes in the sense that we hear endless condemnation of britain in relation to
the slave trade but nobody seems to care about the 45 to 50 million slaves around the world today
yes it says something very profound that we want to revisit the past whereas in fact the story there
is not as people believe it and ignore the fact that there's a great need for people to stand up now
as the anti-slavery campaigners in britain did so effectively a couple of hundred years ago
no that's absolutely right and and i mean let's be clear i mean the reason why some people wanted
to focus on the sins of slavery which were sins um is political uh and people wanted to focus on the
evils of colonialism because it is politically useful to to uh as a kind of lever to to achieve
things politically um but the the whole truth is is is altogether more mixed um and i think it's
really important politically we get our history right otherwise we're susceptible to to false guilt
and we embark on on um well-meaning but ill-judged policies so let's let's get the history right
we live in a culture now where there's an extraordinary almost self-loathing
uh of everything that we are and a
quite noticeable manipulation of history to support a narrative yes that we should
be ashamed of what has gone before us yes and i think that is playing out very badly for young
people what advice would you give that's a sort of a question from left field to parents and
influencers and so forth when it comes to trying to help their children develop a more balanced
approach because it seems to be critically important to me the point you made earlier
we're all a mixture of good and bad it's never as simple as black and white
and if you believe it is you fall under this terrible trap of thinking the world is just
life is just one long battle between good people and bad people
yes and and and if you believe the story is told about our colonial past then it was nothing
but a litany of racism and oppression and violence and that has to shake your confidence
in the in in the nation states and institutions that we built everything comes under question
because because our states were involved in in this imperial oppression and wickedness
so it's really important that the whole truth be told and the whole truth is that the British
Empire for example did some very good things as well as some very bad things
and so what advice will I give well obviously the first piece of advice I give is read my book
because even if you don't agree with with the the the moral argument I make and I try at the
end of the book to come to an overall judgment about the British Empire morally even if you
don't agree with that in the course of the book you will learn a lot about what actually happened
and part of the problem today the reason why this this relentlessly negative reading of our
colonial past has taken root particularly in the educated elite in the media institutions
is that no one knows the history yes so so if activists come along and say it was all racism
genocide no one knows enough to contradict them so my first piece of advice is a part of parents
of teachers read something read my book the other book I'd recommend is is Neil Ferguson's
book entitled simply empire published 20 years ago I reread it recently it's still good and it's
besides unlike mine it's got pictures so do that the the other resource would be the website of
a body called history reclaimed which is is based in this country it's run by Robert Tombs out of
Cambridge University or it's not a Cambridge University entity but he's at Cambridge and he
runs it and this is designed to get historians to write material that is more balanced and provides
the other side of the story and there's lots of stuff up on the website
so I really recommend that parents and teachers of history look at that website which
is universally available I put a proposition to you then and just to test it
you could argue that the means by which Britain became the most powerful nation on earth as
it was for a very long time contains some bad stories as well as some good stories and some
indifferent stories but it needs to be balanced by the reality that then Britain became the first
and only empire of its type to actually abolish slavery so far as I'm aware and it was able
to take on the role of ending it beyond its own economy and peoples because it was big and powerful
so there's two sides to that one story alone
yes so so Britain Britain was not the first to voice the slave trade Denmark was but
in north-west Europe you have a number of nations that come to the view
for the first time in the history of the world that slavery as such is unacceptable
and then Britain because because after the end of the Napoleonic wars in the 15th Britain then
becomes for a century or just over a century the most powerful nation in the world Britain devotes
a lot of its imperial power to suppressing slavery across the world in the 1820s and 30s the slave
trade department was the largest in the British foreign office around 1840-50 the Royal Navy
devoted 13 percent of its total manpower just to suppressing the slave trade across the Atlantic
from West Africa to the Americas so there's that there's also the fact that as I said earlier
the British realized or some British realized that the empire could not consist of a tightly
controlled centralized state so that Britain tightly controls the destinies of peoples in
Australia and Africa and North America and so there was a recognition and in fact in the 1820s
and in India Bombay and Calcutta and Madras are all governed by Scotsman and every one of the
Scotsman says folks we can't be here forever all we can hope to do is to help the Indians develop
decent government and then we should leave with grace and hopefully goodwill and that view was
embodied in the developing Commonwealth idea as I said earlier whereby the empire relaxes into
a family of independent nations which is what it's become and I think that stands to that's the
kind of liberal a liberal vision of the destiny of empire and that I think is creditable and then
the last thing I'd say is remember how the British empire exhausted itself 1939 to 45 doing what fighting
the massively murderous racist regime in Hitler's Berlin and between May 1941 France fell and June
June 41 when Hitler invaded Russia the British empire offered the only military resistance to
Nazism with the sole exception of Greece and that has to say something good about what the empire
had become and what when push came to shove what it stood for to its end like every political body
it contained both good and bad virtue and vice but I think the fact that thanks to the moral
integrity and wisdom of Winston Churchill Britain and the empire and and you know very well and
we British know now too the the efforts to defeat Hitler was an imperial effort your father was
North Africa mine was in Italy he was mistaken for an for an Indian because the Indian division
was off to his right in Italy not India it was a it was a multinational a remarkable multinational
effort and that was devoted to defeating not only Imperial Japan but also Nazi Germany and that I
think if you're going to lose an empire I can't think of a better way to do it. Well thank you
very much that's a great note to end on we need to recognise a history can teach us a great deal
but we need to know what the history actually is absolutely so please read my book
you
