Checking Adventures in Awareness/Michael Levin ｜ Bernardo Kastrup #3： Evolution, Metacognition, Life & Death.txt
 In this dialogue, Bernardo Koch discusses the concept of surprise and how it relates to learning and prediction in both artificial intelligence (AI) systems and biological organisms. He highlights the idea that both AI and life forms are constantly trying to minimize surprise by predicting their environment, which leads to a form of active inference. This conversation converges on the notion that the principles guiding AI could also be applied to understand life itself, potentially leading to a more unified framework for understanding intelligent systems and living organisms.

Michael A. Lebowitz joins the discussion and emphasizes the importance of defining life clearly, suggesting that the criteria for what constitutes life might be expanded under this new framework. He points out that Carl Edwards and Chris Eliasmith have previously suggested that Markov blankets are indicative of life, which aligns with Bernardo's perspective.

The dialogue touches on the work of Douglas Harding, an architect and mystic who wrote about the concept of having no head in the 1960s, and how his work seems to prefigure contemporary discussions in philosophy and science.

Both hosts express gratitude for the depth of the conversation and the ideas exchanged, and there is a consensus that the principles discussed could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of intelligence, both artificial and biological. The discussion ends with an acknowledgment that the audience might want to stay tuned as the conversation continues, and there is an open invitation for Michael A. Lebowitz to return for further dialogue.
