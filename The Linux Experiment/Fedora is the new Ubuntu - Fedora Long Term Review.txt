Hey everyone, this is Nick and I generally don't do distro reviews.
I do cover the major new releases to just talk about what's new but I don't do distro reviews per se.
But this time it's different. I've been using Fedora for a few months now
and the more I use it the more I feel that there's something special about this distribution,
something that other distributions just don't have, something that Ubuntu used to have.
So exceptionally here are my impressions after using Fedora for a few months as my daily driver
and why I think it's the new Ubuntu. Speaking of new, today's sponsor isn't but it's still amazing.
Thanks to Linode for sponsoring this video. Linode is the best choice to deploy your own Linux or
gaming server. Getting started is extremely easy thanks to their app marketplace. You can just
pick from one of the many, many apps they offer, select a few configuration options
and just one click deploy that server. It's super simple. It works for a development environment
but also for a Minecraft or Valheim server. Among the most notable apps, Linode has Moodle to
create your own learning management system and teach and sell courses in minutes but they also
have stuff like Pyhole to block ads even though Linus said it's piracy. From Focalboard,
a Trello alternative to Rocket Chat which is the equivalent to Slack or Teams,
Linode has everything you would want. Click the link in the description to get your $100
credits and get started. Okay so just to be clear, when I say that Fedora is the new Ubuntu,
what I mean is that Fedora now feels the space that Ubuntu used to feel in the Linux distribution
world. Ubuntu used to be the model for how to make a distro. Solid, well-stocked repos,
a focus on user interface and user experience, a big community, an eye towards the future
and pushing innovation in the desktop space. Nowadays, Ubuntu has pretty much lost most of
these advantages but Fedora has picked up the slack. In short, Fedora being the new Ubuntu
is a good thing. One thing that I really enjoy about Fedora is that they push the Linux desktop
towards the future. Some call it bleeding edge but it's not, it's cutting edge. You don't get the
absolute latest but you get the latest that's also stable. Fedora was among the first to adopt
Wayland, the first to adopt PipeWire to push Flatpak, Portals, the first mainstream distro
to push immutable file systems with Silver Blue. They've always wanted to implement the latest
technology without sacrificing stability and ease of use. Contrary to a full-on rolling release,
which kind of feels like playing a Blizzard game. If you don't read the patch notes, you might as
well not play the game because your character or your system is now broken. This drive towards
modern tech was what Ubuntu was doing back in the day. They were implementing the latest versions
of GNOME. They adopted newly developed programs at the time like Banshee or Fspot. They pushed to
have better driver integration and more software available. By embracing all these latest technologies,
Fedora makes sure that they're adopted earlier as well. Implementing Wayland early, for example,
didn't hurt people who couldn't use it, who were defaulted to X11 but it also helped Wayland a lot
by generating more user feedback on what worked and what needed more time in the oven.
To help make hardware support better, they also pushed LVFS, which lets hardware manufacturers
provide firmware updates in a seamless manner for users, where everything is handled graphically
and easily. Same goes for PipeWire, OS3, Toolbox or for any other tech that they chose to go with
before others. This drive towards making sure that their desktop is as current as can be
is really helpful to make the Linux desktop in general progress faster. And Ubuntu also did that
in the past, although they tended to favor their own in-house developed solutions rather than
contributing to what already existed, but both approaches are valid in my opinion. In terms of
using Fedora, it also often meant that I was using new technologies without even realizing it. I've
been using PipeWire for a few months and I didn't even notice. When I update to Fedora 36, Wayland
will be the default, even with my proprietary Nvidia drivers. And I bet I won't even notice
either. So I get to take advantage of all the new stuff with the stability, with the security,
without it breaking anything. Using Fedora, I got that same excitement I used to get when I was using
Ubuntu. Every six months, there's a new drop of amazing updates. You get more modern technologies,
you get improved security, you get new features right as they're being released. And you get that
sense of really taking advantage of all that new stuff the Linux community talks about, or fights
about. I don't really get that same sense of excitement with other distributions. Elementary
OS and Linux Mint do have this kind of same feeling of progression, but they also feel like
they evolve at a slower pace. Other fixed releases generally aren't current. Ubuntu or Zorin OS don't
get the latest and greatest GNOME, for example. You get features that were exciting six months to
a year ago. And rolling releases bombard you with a stream of updates without any real well-defined
progression. If you're constantly moving forward a few inches, then you never get the feeling that
you're moving at all. And that sense of excitement means that updates are no longer this, ugh,
moment. They're actually something that I look forward to. Fedora is a current distro, which
means that you get the latest release of all the interesting stuff, like the desktop environment,
the Linux kernel, the graphics drivers, or Wayland. And they do this without sacrificing
stability. And Fedora, in my experience with it, has been rock solid. In general, I didn't have
many problems with any Linux distro that I daily drove, but all of them tended to exhibit small
issues after a while. Manjaro often had issues after installing updates. Stuff wouldn't work
anymore or required reboots to be fixed, audio stopped working, or the microphone input volume
was turned all the way down for no reason. On elementary OS, on my laptop, I have small issues
that require a reboot. My email account shows as duplicated in the email app. Bluetooth shuts down
and can't be re-enabled until you reboot. Some of my virtual desktops lose their background.
On Fedora, the biggest problem I've encountered so far was after updating DaVinci Resolve. It
wouldn't recognize my GPU anymore and completely uninstalling it and reinstalling it worked without
a reboot. And it was probably more due to the incomprehensible decision of DaVinci Resolve to
provide a .run installer instead of having a DAB, an RPM, or a flat pack. I also had the same issue
with VirtualBox, which was fixed by reinstalling the app. I still get daily updates for a lot of
system components, but my system never crashes, reboots, or displays any undesirable behavior.
These updates are also applied when I reboot. So stuff doesn't get pulled from under my feet.
All the system-related updates only happen when you restart your computer. And all the app updates,
these are handled through Flatpak. And that's also what makes Fedora current,
while remaining stable. The application updates are provided if you so choose through Flatpak,
and either the Fedora remote or FlatHub if you added it. And as I already pointed out in a previous
video, Flatpak is the future. A future you'll get dragged into, whether you like it or not.
Finish your Flatpaks or you're not getting any dessert. This means that all my apps,
or at least all the apps that made the right choice, are updated independently of the distro,
without risking anything breaking. My experience with Fedora has been stellar thanks to this.
Flatpak is wonderfully integrated in GNOME software. It's all a one-click install, one-click update.
My system updates are applied when I reboot, and I literally never think about my system.
I just use it. And that peace of mind is something that I never really had with any other Linux
distro. Ubuntu used to offer this as well, although they never really offered up-to-date apps. Their
app versions never received feature updates, even back in the day. They did have a current
version desktop environment though, which they don't anymore. They have a weird mishmash of GNOME
versions. Another thing I really like is that Fedora has the default experience. They ship the
desktop as is, without any meaningful extensions, themes, configurations or tweaks. Some people
might think it's a bad thing, but it's up to individual choices. I can see why you would want
to have a tweaked KDE or GNOME version, but I don't. Not anymore. When I started using Fedora
and vanilla GNOME, I was a bit apprehensive. GNOME didn't work at all like what I was used to,
which was a macOS-like version of KDE using LatteDoc. In the end, it took me a few hours to replace
my flinging of the mouse to the bottom edge to reveal the dock, into hitting the super key
and displaying the dock, or just typing the name of the app I wanted. After that, it was just
productivity central. GNOME for me doesn't need anything else than the default experience. It is
extremely efficient once you wrap your head around how it works, and providing me with a crutch,
like an always-visible dock or desktop icons, would just compromise that productivity.
That's the way it is for me, at least. Don't get all offended. Your desktop icons might be a
monstrosity, but you have every right to want to use them. You monster. That default experience
contributes to Fedora being current. With a lot of extensions and more tools tacked on, you often
have to delay your update to the latest version of GNOME, because you can't be sure that you've
tested it enough. Fedora doesn't have that issue and provides me with a more productive desktop
as a result. That was what Ubuntu was doing as well. The latest and greatest GNOME experience with
all the bells and whistles, and the default experience, except for the theme. And when they
switched to Unity, it was the same thing, but obviously it was because they developed it, so
yeah, of course they would have the default experience. Moving to Fedora also had me learn a
few things, especially how to use DNF. I didn't need to use it, but I wanted to, and since I was
a lot more familiar with apt, I had no idea what I was doing. Turns out Fedora has a huge community
as well, something Ubuntu has had ever since it began. And that's another checkmark on my Fedora
is the next Ubuntu checklist. Fedora has very active forums and a lot of online help available
to learn about these things. Applications often have an RPM, and if they don't, they tend to have
a flatback version. Generally, you're not left behind. At least I never was. Everything I wanted
to do, I could find a guide, a tutorial or an application to do so, and it was extremely easy.
So my experience with Fedora has been fantastic. I enjoy the great stability, the absence of issues
and the background updates at reboot. I love that I can get all my apps through Flatpak and how
well it's integrated. I really enjoy the vanilla GNOME experience without added overhead or crutches
that would detract me from GNOME's actual productivity, at least in my case. And I also love
that it makes me excited to get updates again. Before, I just didn't really feel like they
brought anything, or I even dreaded them because they had broken things for me in the past.
Now I'm just updating every day, my apps get their fixes and new features right away,
and my system will be up to date when I boot it back up in the morning. Could I get all of this
on another distro? Probably yeah, but I would have to do some extra work to remove stuff I don't
need like extensions, and I would also not get all the latest and greatest tech without sacrificing
the stability. And that's why Fedora, to me, is what Ubuntu used to be. It's up to date,
it gets new stuff regularly, it's stable, it's user-friendly, and it pushes the Linux desktop
forward. Which means that in the next few weeks, it will also replace elementary OS on my laptop.
Yes, it's that good. Just like today's sponsors, SlimBook, these guys make Linux laptops and
desktops from Valencia, Spain. They have all keyboard layouts, they ship. Worldwide, they have
a wide range of devices at all price points, like for example, the SlimBook Essential,
their entry-level Ultrabook. It's greatly designed, it's got a good screen, good internals, great
keyboard, great build quality, and a low starting price. If you need a new Linux device, check the
link in the description below and hit SlimBook up, they are really good. Now thanks everyone for
