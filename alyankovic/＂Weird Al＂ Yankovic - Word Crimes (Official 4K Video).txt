If you can't write in the proper way If you don't know how to conjugate
Maybe you flunked that class And maybe now you find
That people mock you on the cloud
Okay now here's the deal I'll try to educate you
Gonna familiarize you with the nomenclature
You learn the definitions of nouns and prepositions
Literacy's your mission And that's why I think it's a good time
I learned some grammar Now did I spammer
Work on that grammar You should know when
It's less or it's fewer Like people who were
Never raised in us who were These word crimes
Like I could care less I think you do care less
And yeah, it's a little bit more on Hey, you better slow down
I think I've grown out of a juggle world you're in no clown
Say you got an IT Followed by a puzzle
See you still what does that mean You would not use this in this case
As a possessive No, no, no, no, no It's a contraction
It's a contraction Well, that's a shopping at the border
I'll report them before it expires I'll send the letter
Okay now here's some notes Syntax ya always banging
No X in Espresso Your pot of sipples dangling
If you really want to leave out that Oxford card, just keep a mind at PC
Are you?
Are words not letters?
Get it together
No checker
You should never
Write words using numbers
Unless you're seven
Your name is Premiere
I hate these word crimes
You really need them
I need them crimes
I'm not free
You should hire
Someone in this hall
To help you distinguish
What is my birth?
One thing I ask of you
Time to learn your homophones is past
Learn to diagram a sentence to
Always say to whom, don't ever say to who
And listen up, when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis
You finish second grade, I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well
Better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
But once you figure it to then what's literal
But just now, you said
You literally couldn't get out of bed
That really makes me want to literally smack a crowbar
Of fingers to but head
Oh yeah, yeah, it's quite apparent
You're a grander parent
You're incoherent
You're a fire-blood boss
It's really fantastic
That was sarcastic
That's right, like a spastic
I hate these word crowds
Your pose is dopey
You think you should only
Write an emoji
You're a lost cause
Go back to preschool
Get out of the gene pool
Hey, hey, hey, hey
No, you're not true
Nevermind, I give up
Woo
Really, no, I give up
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Go away
