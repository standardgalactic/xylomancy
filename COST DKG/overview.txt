Checking COST DKG/Ilaria Tiddi： ＂Explainability with Knowledge Graphs： what have we learnt？＂ (COST DKG Talk Series).txt
1. The discussion touched upon multimodal knowledge graphs and their integration with the physical world, particularly in the context of robots and the challenges they pose for knowledge graphs. The idea of generating explanations that can handle both abstract concepts and physical world data was seen as interesting and relevant.

2. The original methods discussed could potentially be applied to multimodal data points, such as image labels, which could benefit from multimodal explanations. However, these methods were not explicitly designed for multimodal knowledge graphs, which could be a promising area for future research.

3. The cost action on distributed and decentralized knowledge graphs focuses on non-centralized data models, where the goal is to avoid relying on stored data and its associated data models. The key challenge has been identifying relevant connections between disparate data points, which remains relevant regardless of whether the information is centralized or decentralized.

4. The approaches developed after the dereferencing eyes method do not necessarily depend on global embeddings; they aim to capture a lot of information in a small space and facilitate serendipitous navigation through query languages, which could work in both centralized and decentralized contexts.

5. The speaker emphasizes that as long as there are connections or pointers between data points, the methods for identifying relevant information can be applied, whether the data is stored in a web of data or in a local file like an HDT file.

6. The talk was well-received, and the speaker thanked the audience for their engagement. The next talk will be on January 31st at the same time, and details can be found on the cost action's website, social media channels (previously known as Twitter), and all recordings of the talks are available on the YouTube channel.

In summary, the conversation highlighted the potential for existing methods to be adapted for multimodal knowledge graphs and underscored the importance of distributed and decentralized approaches in knowledge graph research. The speaker expressed openness to exploring these areas further and encouraged viewers to stay tuned for future talks.
