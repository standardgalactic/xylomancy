Processing Overview for By Default
============================
Checking By Default/Simple, Non-Commercial, Open Source Notes.txt
 The speaker initially set out to find a Notion alternative but ended up exploring various text editors due to their interest in Vim plugins like Do Me Max and NVChad. They discuss the utility of these plugins within NeoVim and consider whether it might be easier to create their own configuration rather than customizing an existing base config. The speaker also mentions Cocoon, a modal editor that emphasizes simplicity by focusing on being just a text editor without unnecessary features, and Helix, which is similar but lacks plugin support at the moment.

They delve into other minimalist editors like Super Bear Bones' Viz and NeatVI, with NeatVI being particularly simple with its 6000 lines of C code and no mouse support. The speaker humorously notes that their exploration of minimalist text editors has taken them far from the initial topic of a Notion replacement.

The speaker acknowledges their own fascination with software and computers, despite their claims to hate them. They express interest in hearing about ultra-minimalist software usages and remark on the length and shift in focus of the video, which started as an ode to QO notes, moved to discussing Emacs, and ended up being about Vim plugins.

In conclusion, the speaker humorously admonishes themselves and the viewer for getting lost in the rabbit hole of productivity software instead of actually using the tools to get work done. They encourage the viewer, especially if they've watched the entire video, to stop watching and start taking action with their notes and tasks. The speaker directly addresses a hypothetical person named Amir, advising them to stop watching these YouTube videos and to begin using their system effectively.
