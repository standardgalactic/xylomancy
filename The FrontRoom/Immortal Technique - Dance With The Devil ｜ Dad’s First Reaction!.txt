Hi everybody, welcome back to the front room. I'm Kai and I'm here with my dad today.
Hi guys, hope you're having a good day. Thanks for joining us again.
Maybe, maybe you won't have a good day after listening to this song.
Oh.
I'm going to show you at least.
Okay.
Great. Good to hear that.
This is a highly requested song and artist.
I could take a stab at who it might be, but I won't.
Okay.
We're going to be listening to a song called Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.
She thought it might be that one. I really did.
Yeah, because people have asked for it for a long, long time.
Yeah, a long time.
Yeah. Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.
Yes. It's an underground classic, but it's so popular in the underground.
You know, people that maybe don't listen to rap that much or, you know, might have come
across it. It's got released in 2001, and it's a pretty epic song, but I was going
to say, you know, I've listened to some other Immortal Technique. I haven't been the biggest
fan. This song sticks out for me as one of his better ones that I've heard, but definitely
I was going to say I'm a fan of the song, but I don't know if that's the right word
to describe appreciating the song. So you'll see that. Usually I give you the lyrics, but
this time I'm going to hold off because he's pretty easy to understand. If you need the
lyrics halfway through when I pause or something, just let me know and then I can give them
to you.
I'll do that.
But just focus in and get ready.
Dance with the Devil?
Yeah.
Oh boy. Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
Theme from the movie Love Story. Yeah.
Mellow and...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Very easy to understand.
That was a good line.
That was a good line.
I'm just going to pause it there.
I can totally understand it.
That's good.
Yeah. It's telling the story of this guy, just trying to... guy who's trying to make
it in the world in terms of selling drugs and then trying to move up through the ranks,
I guess.
Yeah.
But people are saying, what have you got that a thousand other guys don't have, right?
Yeah.
Exactly.
And even if you do get that money, you can't buy respect with money.
So, yeah, he was dealing drugs, then did he catch the end of that verse where they said,
if you really want to move up the ranks and be on our level, be part of the club, I suppose,
you have to rape somebody.
God, no, I missed that.
No.
Do you want to rewind that a little bit?
Yeah.
Sounds like it's kind of important.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They had money with made men up in the site.
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree, a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted
to be.
And so he met through Friday night at a quarter to three.
Right.
Right.
And before that, they say,
they say, or he says, yeah,
and stab them repeatedly and stand over them
until they die, right?
And it also rapes somebody.
Show that you're really tough,
that you're really, you're worthy to be one of us.
Wow, yeah.
Yeah, so I think.
Initiation into the.
Yeah, exactly, you know, they said basically,
anybody can shoot a gun, right?
Anybody can sell drugs.
But you want to actually be a ruthless person.
Like us, you gotta do these things.
So it's a tale of whether or not he wants to do it.
Yeah, you know what?
And before this, this stanza or this portion of the song
started up, there was a drop in the music.
Did you notice that?
Sort of a, it went down a notch.
I don't know how to explain it.
Where he wasn't rapping or when he was.
Yeah, there was a change in, there's no piano.
It was some sort of strings.
Yeah, and it almost sounded like there was,
the music got kind of a little more,
not ominous, but there was a drop in the music.
And I thought immediately,
okay, there's a change here and something's coming up.
Right, yeah.
I think, I'm not sure exactly what the change was there.
Yeah.
But I think it was just leading up
to this sort of pivotal moment.
Yeah, it was, it was.
So that might have been that.
Yeah, neat.
Do you want the lyrics or you think you're good?
I don't think I need them.
Okay.
Yeah.
["Dive Out of My Heart"]
Everyone trying to be trife,
never face the consequences.
You probably only did a month for minor offenses.
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance.
But then again, there's always the wicked at new and advanced.
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block.
The chorus.
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock.
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top.
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot.
I love that.
That is the best line in the song.
They drove around the project slow while it was raining.
Smoking, blunt, stringing and joking for entertainment.
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone.
Three in the morning coming back from work on the way home.
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her.
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her.
They wrapped a shirt around their head
and knocked her onto the floor.
This is it, kid.
Now you got your chance to be raw.
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there.
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up
the stairs, they got to the roof
and then held her down on the ground.
Screaming, shut the fuck up and stop moving around.
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed.
So Billy stomped on the bitch till he broken a jaw.
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing.
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs
and she stopped moving, blood leaking through the cloth.
She cried silently and then they all proceeded
to rape her violently.
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn,
ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned.
A broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned.
When they were done and she was lying,
bloody broken and bruised.
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new 22.
They told him that she was a witness
for what she'd gone through.
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in a crew.
He thought about it for a minute.
She was practically dead.
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head.
I'm falling and I can't turn back.
I'm falling and I can't turn back.
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life,
he thought about the copain with the platinum and ice.
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers,
cocked the gap to her head and pulled back the shirt cover.
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter,
because he was staring into the eyes of his own mother.
She looked back at him and cried, because he had forsaken her.
She cried more painfully.
And when they were raping her, his whole world stopped.
He couldn't even contemplate.
His corruption had successfully changed his fate.
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late,
working hard for nothing.
Because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
and crying out to the sky, because he was lonely and scared.
But only the devil responded, because God wasn't there.
And right then, he knew what it was to be empty and cold.
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul.
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it.
After that, they killed his mother and never spoke about it.
And listen, because the story that I'm telling is true,
because I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too.
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go.
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you
at my shows in every street site for listening to little thugs
flow.
You could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know.
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked,
white, brown, yellow, and black.
Color is not restricted.
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted.
And you'll be one of God's children.
It fell from the top.
There's no diversity, because we're burning in the melting
pot.
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never,
because a dance with the devil might last you forever.
That's crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
Oh, my gosh.
Mm.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
Gosh, what a story.
He told it so well.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
That was mind-blowing.
That was hard to listen to.
Yeah.
That's the reason why I've only, you know, when the devil said he
got to show your dad this, I was like, you know, I've listened
to the song, but after the first time, I never really
wanted to listen to it again.
It's so graphic.
It's so clear.
But there's such a big message attached to this, you know?
It's so apparent.
The message is apparent.
I don't really have to go over it, right?
But just, you know, yeah.
But I imagine there are a lot of people who are trying to get
out of their situation, who may be tempted to follow, who may
be tempted to go against their better judgment of what they
believe in, and they get caught up in things, right?
That leads them to do crazy things.
Yeah.
And yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
Tough song.
Yeah.
Geez.
And I guess something important to know, like, his mother, right?
Yeah.
So is this true?
Is this true?
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, there's a lot of sort of...
I mean, it could be true, but...
Well, he says it is a true story, but a true story in the
sense that maybe it didn't exactly happen the way it did.
But, you know, because it's so, so like graphic and, you know,
it's like watching a train crash, as they say.
Yeah, it is.
You know, that thing's just escalating and out of control.
Yeah.
And it's going to be a bad situation, but you just...
It has your attention locked on it.
Yeah.
So he said the reason...
Some people said, you know, he didn't need to make it that
graphic and things like that.
But he said it just captures your attention.
Oh, no.
I disagree.
Yeah.
It captures your attention.
And that's why it's become...
The song has become into sort of...
It has its own lore to it.
No, it catches you.
Oh, really?
Yeah, where people say, you know, they hadn't heard a song
like this before.
Yeah.
And wherever they were in the world, they were like, you know,
stuff like this happens.
And I didn't realize that other people sort of...
It made them realize that it's a universal thing where people
want to sacrifice possibly their morality for riches and power
and whatnot.
Oh, yeah.
Well, he mentioned it.
He says...
I think he says black, white.
He mentioned, you know, this could happen to anybody, right?
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I think...
No, I think it's great that he spelled it out this way because,
you know, I could imagine somebody who, you know, listens to rap,
hearing this, someone who's maybe on the wrong path,
on the wrong direction, and hearing this and possibly having
this really sink in because it's so vivid, right?
And using the mother or his mother as a sort of a symbol,
not...
Because it's not actually his mother that he raped, right?
That'd be impossible for him to just realize that before he was
going to blow her brains out.
Yeah.
It's just symbolic for his society and his own mother, right?
Because if you're taking away that person's innocence
and no respect towards them, that's also going to be destructive
towards your own community.
So that's the reason why he said...
He says it's not a song about rape like a lot of people think it is.
It's a song about making people realize that women are,
what he says, the most important people in society,
and especially Latino and Latina and Black women,
are often, you know, disrespected.
Yeah.
So it's to sort of make people realize...
Right.
It goes beyond just the story of rape, right?
Yeah.
He would encompass the whole, his belief point of view.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
It was really good.
Really good.
And that last line there, that last two, I suppose?
Starting here.
Yeah.
So when the devil wants to dance to you, you better say never
because a dance for the devil might last you forever.
Yeah.
I like a lot of the lyrics.
I had said, I love that lyric where he talks about the angels used to be up here
and now they've fallen and the devils are down here
and now it's one melting pot.
That's the chorus.
That's the chorus.
The chorus is not delineated strongly as a chorus, is it?
Yeah, not exactly.
There's a little bit of a pause before he starts rapping,
and that shows that it's a new section.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that was great.
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top.
Yeah.
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot.
Yeah, I love that.
And I think possibly the most powerful thing in the song,
you're not powerful, it's hard to say what's the most powerful in this song.
But one of the most powerful things is that he eventually kills himself.
Oh, I know.
Yeah.
But he won't go to heaven.
No.
He's going straight to hell, and he knows it, yet he does it
because once you do something that bad, you can't escape it.
What's done is done, right?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
Wow, this is quite something.
Quite something.
So this is 2001.
I noticed that the rhymes come in at the end of the line.
Yeah, he's not the most technical rapper from what?
And he actually is slightly messy in terms of his technical ability.
All right.
But that allows it to be more of a stream of consciousness thing,
where he's just telling a story or talking to you.
That's why it's so easy to follow.
That's the feeling I got.
That's the feeling I got.
Yeah, he's telling a story.
I found the music was good because it didn't take you away from the story at all.
It's just there and a beautiful piano.
Beautiful melody.
Slightly haunting.
At least when it's paired with this...
Yeah, melancholy story.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
So that is Dance with the Devil.
I could see why everybody wanted me to hear that.
And I didn't need any...
I didn't need Kleenex.
But it was quite something.
People are saying, you know, don't show him this because he will be destroyed by it.
No, I think this is a really, really well done song.
And I feel that this song was almost necessary to spell these things out.
Why should we not say this type of stuff?
Why should we not go there?
Right?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, you're welcome, I suppose.
Yeah, in a way.
Thanks, guys.
I hope you...
I don't know if enjoy is the right word, but I hope you found our video today interesting
for you in some way.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Thanks for watching, everybody, and thanks for checking in.
Yeah.
See you soon.
