Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.
What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.
Alpha North Whitehead
Previously I described the ways in which Descartes' philosophy resulted in what we
could call a bifurcation of nature, which separated the world into two distinct metaphysical realms,
that of mind and that of matter.
But it was another philosopher who would see most clearly the problems which were developing
from this modernist post-Cartesian paradigm and who would codify many of the conceptual
elements which would come to characterize modern thought for centuries to come.
That philosopher was Immanuel Kant.
Through David Hume, Kant would come to see the true extent of the implications wrought
by Descartes' systematic skepticism.
If we cannot be certain that our experiences of the world actually coincide with a world
beyond our perceptions, then how can we justify any of our empirical claims about the world
at all?
How do we know that any of our scientific claims actually have any objective validity?
Not so that such knowledge about the world would require more than empirical observation.
We can observe that the sun has risen every day up until now, but we cannot simply observe
a law which demands such regularity.
We must infer such laws, and thus empirical observation alone is not enough to actually
ground scientific knowledge.
Or can we say that the constancy of the sun's behavior is dictated by logic, as Kant understood
logical truths to apply only to relations of ideas, rather than facts about the natural
world.
Kant's solution was to make a distinction, much like Descartes' distinction between
mind and matter, between what he termed phenomena and numina.
For Kant, the world of phenomena was the world of experience.
The phenomenal world is the world as we experience it, the world as it is conditioned by our faculties
of perception and understanding.
Kant saw that the human psyche itself played a crucial role in synthesizing our sense perceptions
together into intelligible experiences.
Much like the way that the Copernican Revolution came to place the sun at the center of the
solar system, the Kantian Revolution placed the human psyche at the center of the world
which we actually experience.
According to Kant, we did not experience the world in itself, but rather experienced phenomena,
experiences of the world which were necessarily conditioned by the functioning of the human
mind in consistent ways.
By understanding the way that the human mind conditioned our experiences, Kant could in
a sense reclaim objectivity and thereby re-ground science in the wake of Cartesian and Humean
radical skepticism.
Hume had argued that we never actually experienced causation or time, and thus argued that we
inferred those aspects of reality in an irrational way.
Kant instead argued that space, time, and causality were all among a variety of categories
which the human mind necessarily used to condition our experiences of the world.
Space, time, and causation argued Kant were not necessarily aspects of the world in itself,
but were, at the very least, necessary aspects of the way that the human mind structures
our experiences of reality.
Those aspects were therefore necessary aspects of the phenomenal world, the world which we
experience, but not necessarily the world in itself.
But then what about the world as it actually is?
What about this presupposed ding on seek or thing in itself which Kant supposed to
lie somewhere behind or beneath the phenomenal world of experiences?
Within this Kantian understanding of reality, we never actually encounter the world as it
is in itself, but only phenomena.
The world itself is something which would thus seem to be forever beyond our reach.
We cannot go around our experiences to check if our experiences of the world actually correspond
to how the world actually is.
Although Kant believed that he had rescued science from radical skepticism, there remains
a looming epistemological nihilism behind Kant's ideas.
What if there is no world in itself?
If we by definition cannot encounter such a world, then what reason do we really have
to believe that there is such a thing in itself at all?
Now of course this all might seem rather pedantic, it seems rather obvious that there is indeed
a world beyond our experiences of the world.
The world remains even after we look away and return our gaze to it.
Great Walls stop foreheads regardless as to how our consciousness construes them.
But what we are seeing here in this problem is yet another unfolding of the deeply rooted
incoherence of the Cartesian worldview.
Kant's demarcation of phenomena and numina is a kind of reformulation of the Cartesian
split between mind and matter.
Another split which would seem to create an infinitely vast and unbridgeable gulf between
our consciousness and the world which we inhabit.
Kant had no choice but to resign himself to a kind of epistemological quietism with regards
to the world beyond our senses.
He deeply held that there must be an actual world which exists independently of our experiences.
But he saw no way to actually say anything about that world.
The world would have to remain forever beyond our grasp, an impenetrable mystery which would
always lie beyond the confines of our minds.
The paradigm of modern science presupposes that what lies beyond our consciousness is
something we call matter, which is supposed to be entirely objective in character, that
which exists independently of our senses.
Yet Kant had shown us that we can never actually encounter matter at all, but rather only our
experiences of an unknowable something which we can only presume to exist beyond our own minds.
Following Kant, many philosophers would come to reject or reformulate Kant's distinction
between phenomena and numina in such a way that this intractable gulf could be mended.
One of those philosophers was Henri Bergson, initially educated as a mathematician and
later developing an acute interest in the French spiritualism movement,
which would also give us figures such as Jean Gebseur.
Henri Bergson rejected outright the Cartesian conception of mind as a kind of screen,
which separated us intractably from a world which was believed to be entirely devoid of consciousness.
In aiming for the heart of this issue, Bergson asks us in his monumental work,
Matter and Memory, to think about what matter must actually be given the way in which we actually
experience the world around us. We begin with our experiences of the world.
We can then divert our attention from the world temporarily and return to see that the objects
of the world yet remain. We thus rightly conclude that the world is not merely a projection of
our minds, there is something out there as it were, which is provided to our consciousness.
But what exactly is it that is provided by the world? The answer is, of course, experiences.
There is never anything extra which we encounter by definition, and thus Bergson concludes that
matter, that which is there when we are not looking, consists of latent potential experiences.
Now at first this might seem a bit odd, but let us think about what an experience really is.
It is the feeling of a relationship between ourselves and the objects which constitute the
world. Thus to say that matter is comprised of potential or latent experiences is to say that
the objectivity of matter consists precisely in its potential for coming into such relationships.
In simply following through more fully on the implications hidden within Cartesian dualism,
Bergson thus came to essentially turn inside out the Cartesian and Kantian formulations of the
bifurcation of nature, such that mind and matter were now seen to be necessarily codependent and
interpenetrating. After all, what else could matter possibly be other than experiences that have yet
to become actualized? There are many implications which then unfold from
re-synthesizing mind and matter in this way. In following Bergson we can see that subjectivity
is in fact a fundamental aspect of reality itself, and that complex minds such as our own do not in
fact have a monopoly on experience. In following through on the ontological implications of the
nature of our own existence, we come to see that experience itself is in fact a fundamental aspect
of the world itself. Bergson would then go on to formulate a very different sort of fundamental
dichotomy, not between mind and matter, but rather between the mechanical and the organic.
For Bergson, mechanical causation is that in which an event is determined entirely by
preceding events, as in the case of falling dominoes or billiard balls bouncing off of one
another. It is the realm of the mechanistic that science has striven to prioritize since its initial
conception within Cartesian philosophy, but science often overextends itself in attempting to describe
the organic aspects of reality as though the organic were merely a more complex form of the
mechanistic. Rather Bergson saw the organic as always being in a kind of dynamic relationship
with the past or the future or both. It is not only the immediately preceding moment which determines
an organic behavior, but rather organic systems are able to draw from a kind of embodied memory,
which extends much further into the past. Organic activity is therefore much more than
the mechanistic sequence of immediately prior events determining immediately subsequent events.
We see this concept illustrated by these cone-like diagrams, which Bergson employed within matter
and memory. We can also see that these cones can stretch upward as well as downward, indicating
that organisms are also capable of bringing possible futures into relation with the present
in much the same way that they are able to bring the past into relation with the present.
It would be this Bergsonian conception of organic memory, which would later inspire
Rupert Sheldrake's development of Morphic resonance theory, which we explored in a previous
series on this channel. Tufts University biologist Michael Levin has also employed very similar
ideas and even very similar diagrammatic illustrations in his theoretical work regarding
what he has dubbed cognitive light cones. What is most significant for our purposes here, however,
is the manner in which Bergson's metaphysics collapses mind and matter back into one another
in such a manner that experientiality is seen to be a fundamental aspect of nature itself.
In correspondence to this fusion of mind and matter, there is also a correlative fissioning
apart of the organic and the mechanistic. Rather than seeing organisms as squishy, complex machines,
Bergson saw a very real divide between processes which were merely mechanistic and those which
were genuinely alive, organic or animate. But now I want us to turn our attention to a philosopher
who would go even further than Bergson or any other thinker in his attempt to mend the Cartesian
rupture between mind and matter, and who would lay the groundwork for what is today an entire field
of philosophy, now known often as process philosophy or process metaphysics. Here I am
referring to the British mathematician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead, one of the
single most titanic figures within the early development of what we now term analytic philosophy,
but who described his own philosophical system not as process philosophy, nor as analytic philosophy,
but rather as a philosophy of organism. Whitehead himself was very closely interested and involved
within the developments of physics, which had begun to take shape in the early 20th century,
developments which would culminate in what we now refer to as quantum electrodynamics or quantum
field theory, as well as the theory of general relativity. Both Henri Bergson and Whitehead
would be very outspoken critics of what they saw as the implicit metaphysics of Einstein's
general relativity, and Whitehead himself would develop an alternative conception of gravity
and relativity, which he believed would avoid the pitfalls of Einstein's conception, particularly
the so-called black holes, which Einstein himself believed to be a refutation of his own conception
of relativity, rather than a natural inference from it. But overall, Whitehead was a thinker who
perhaps more so than any other thinker of his own time or sense saw the writing on the walls
very clearly. The metaphysical paradigm which had dominated science since the days of Descartes
simply would not survive the developments in physics, which were now being substantiated by
precise measurements and experimental observations. The Enlightenment vision of the clockwork universe
and clockmaker God were no longer adequate in accounting for the world which was coming to
be revealed by the science which had stemmed from that vision. A new vision was needed, as was a new
conceptual framework, and Whitehead would set himself the task of developing just such a conceptual
system. In 1924, Whitehead would relocate to the United States, where at Harvard University,
he would begin his philosophical project in earnest. In 1925, Whitehead would publish
Science and the Modern World, in which Whitehead would begin developing his critique of and
alternative to Cartesian dualism. In 1927, Whitehead would present his more formalized ideas
as a series of lectures which in 1929 would be published as Process and Reality, a work which
is now generally considered to be Whitehead's magnum opus and the most rigorous articulation
of the metaphysical scheme which he had come to develop.
Alright guys, so I am not going to sugarcoat this, I am about to throw some very dense and
nuanced terminology at you guys that will probably seem very alien and counterintuitive.
If you've never encountered Whitehead's ideas before, so bear with me, there is a bit of jargon
to unpack here, but these ideas really are not that complicated. If they seem difficult,
it's not because any of this is particularly arcane or bizarre, rather it's because of how
dramatically Whitehead's ideas stand in contrast to the implicit presumptions which remain the
accepted doctrines of the post-Cartesian Modernist worldview. As previously mentioned, Whitehead
refers to the system developed in Process and Reality as a philosophy of organism,
and this nomenclature indicates that Whitehead had come to see the fundamental nature of the
world as organic, rather than consisting fundamentally of lifeless inert material as
implied by the Cartesian paradigm which he sought to subvert. In Process and Reality,
Whitehead is attempting to rigorously describe a reality which he saw as inexorably alive,
even at the most basic level. Most central to Whitehead's system is a concept which he refers
to as concrescence, a term which refers to what Whitehead saw as the fundamental nature of time.
Concrescence implies a synthesis or coming together of actualities and potentialities
which thereby come to concretize and thus form the basic units of the world,
which he variously termed actual occasions, actual entities, or electromagnetic occasions of
experience. As we also saw in Bergson's Metaphysics, we can see in Whitehead's scheme
the implication that reality is characterized by both objectivity and subjectivity even at the
most basic level. But moreover, Whitehead is also indicating that the most basic elements of the
world are events rather than enduring material objects, rather than picturing nature as made
up of tiny BBs bouncing around in the void. Whitehead was taking the implications of quantum
physics seriously, and thus concluding that the fundamental entities of the world are processes
rather than material bodies. An actual event is formed by the process of concrescence,
and the nature of that process is determined by relationships which Whitehead calls prehensions.
The word prehension, similar to the word apprehension, etymologically implies grasping or
taking up. Prehensions are the basic forms of interaction which give shape to actual events
and allow for the achievement of determinacy from distributions or fields of indeterminacy.
This concretization corresponds to what physicists would describe as wave function collapse.
Whitehead describes three types of prehension, physical prehension, conceptual prehension,
and hybrid prehension. These are the basic components of what Whitehead describes as a
theory of feelings. I'm going to briefly describe the first two types of prehension here, but the
third type, hybrid prehension, is a bit more complicated, and so that's something which
we will be coming back to in later videos. Physical prehension consists in relationships
between an organic process and actual occasions which have already occurred, and which have
thus already come to be concretized as determinate events within the past. Past actualities contribute
themselves to a novel moment of creative genesis, and this is the process which we commonly describe
as physical causation, or efficient teleology to use Aristotelian terms. In contrast to physical
prehension, we then have conceptual prehension. Conceptual prehension is the experience of
possibilities rather than past actualities. It is the feeling of real potentialities
which are available to a given concrescence, a given moment of experience.
Whitehead describes these potentialities as eternal objects, which are essentially equivalent
to platonic forms. They are the basic structures or patterns which an event can incorporate into
itself so as to thereby achieve concrete determinacy. An occasion of concrescence is
fundamentally an experiential decision in which the event actively selects which possibilities
come to give shape to it as it then concretizes and then becomes a definite feature of the past.
So let's now try to make sense of all that by actually looking at how this scheme might map
on to the basic features of our world. Quantum mechanics describes the world as
consisting fundamentally of fields and particles. The word particle, however, is already itself
something of an issue as the word particle is something that we intuitively take to refer
to a material body of some sort, a physically enduring BB of some sort. As previously indicated,
Whitehead's scheme is one in which the basic elements are events rather than material bodies.
You can find this conceptual convolution present in almost any discussions pertaining to quantum
mechanics. Physicists speak of quantum particles as though they are physical bodies and with the
next breath tell us that these particles can be distributed throughout space, that they can be
in various locations at the same time. Particles are also described as point-like,
meaning that they are said to have no physical extension in space, even though they are also
implied to be physical bodies which have properties such as mass. Seen through Whitehead's conceptual
scheme, however, what we instead find are distributions of real potentiality and fully
determinate events. For example, physicists will often describe the electron orbital shell of an
atom as a distribution of probability which radiates outward from the atomic nucleus.
There is a material, or at least quasi-material body, which we call the electron particle,
but the so-called particle exists throughout this distributional aura until a particular
interaction event occurs at which point the electron will indeed come to be at a particular
location in space, at least for that particular moment. Within Whitehead's scheme, however,
there simply are no material or quasi-material bodies which underlie such quantum phenomena.
There are fields which are distributions of possible events, and then there are the actual
events themselves, the electromagnetic occasions of experience. These events are experiential,
decisive, and essentially organic processes which can come to loop back upon themselves
so as to form recurrent cyclical oscillatory patterns, knots of electromagnetic process,
as it were, which when sufficiently rigidified begin to behave in a manner analogous to what
we would expect from enduring physical bodies. The electronic field which surrounds the atom is
thus not a particle which is in numerous places all at once, but rather it is a range of possible
locations in which electromagnetic events could possibly occur. These events then condition
the structure of future possibilities and thus condition the nature of subsequent events,
but this efficient determination is never complete. The electromagnetic occasions of
experience always have options, and this is the nature of the fundamental indeterminacy
which we find in quantum electrodynamics. Within the philosophy of organism,
the basic structure of human experience is also the basic structure of the world itself.
We are living beings, and reality itself shares in this character with us. There is no
introversible gulf between the nature of our own existence and the nature of the world.
To be a subject within an objective reality is simply to be a participant within the ongoing
creative advance of the cosmos which we are a part of. As Whitehead states in Science in the
Modern World, quote, biology is the study of the larger organisms, whereas physics is the study
of the smaller organisms, end quote. Quantum events are the most basic organic processes which
constitute the world, and atoms are the most basic organisms, the most basic self-referential
knots comprised of such organic events. For Whitehead, nature is organic in the sense that
it is fundamentally experiential, but also in that it is fundamentally self-creative.
It is characterized by what the biologist Francisco Varela would call autopoiesis.
For Whitehead, time itself is a creative advance through which nature continually
strives towards the actualization of ever more complex and synergistic novelty.
Mere mechanistic causation is the exception, not the rule, within such a universe.
Organic processes strive to sustain and perpetuate themselves, and in doing so come to form symbiotic
relationships with one another, thereby giving rise to ever more complex organisms,
with ever more richly nuanced experiences. Whitehead's paradigm is one in which biological
organisms are but one particular branch of a tree of life which includes atoms as well as stars,
planetary systems, and galaxies. At all levels, what we find are self-organizing and
self-creative electromagnetic systems which come to synchronize the diversity of nature into complex
living unities. Now that all might sound like a bunch of poetic gobbledygook if you're new to
these ideas, and I'm going to abstain from making this video two hours long by unpacking them even
further, for now at least. However, if you want to see these principles in action, then I'd recommend
checking out my video series on Rupert Sheldrake's theory of Morphic Resonance, in which I also talk
a bit about Michael Levin's research regarding bioelectricity. Both Sheldrake and Levin are
contemporary standard bearers for this more organismic conception of the world. I would also
recommend checking out some of the ideas developed by adherents of the Electric Universe model of
cosmology, which has been an attempt to understand astrophysical phenomena in terms of electro-organic
self-organization. As data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope continues to make it
increasingly undeniable that our current mechanistic cosmology is in an inescapable crisis. I think it
is now more important than ever that we take very seriously the thinkers who saw in advance the problems
which are intrinsic to the underlying presumptions of modern science, Bergson and Whitehead being
only two of many such figures. Within an organismic rather than mechanistic paradigm, we avoid the
intractable problems of somehow deriving consciousness from inanimate matter, as we can see that the world
simply is not comprised of inanimate matter, but rather of animate processes which are themselves
already experiential in character. Consciousness and existence are intertwined from their very
foundations. We can see that we don't need to wait for some arcane mathematical models in order to
understand consciousness scientifically. Seen correctly, disciplines such as biology and physics
already are the study of consciousness. I'll be leaving it at that for now, however, so thanks
for watching and have a great week. I'll see you in the next video.
