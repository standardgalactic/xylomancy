Checking C. Brin/Where will we be in 40 yearsï¼Ÿ A Conversation between Futurists David Brin and John Smart.txt
 In this conversation, the discussion revolves around the hypothetical scenario where advanced civilizations might have the capability to instantaneously connect with all other civilizations across the galaxy upon entering a state of transcendence or black hole-like objects. The Transition Hypothesis suggests that due to extreme space-time dilation near a black hole, an individual entering the vicinity of the event horizon would experience instantaneous gravitational merging with all other event horizons. This concept raises questions about the nature of consciousness, identity, and the preservation of diversity among civilizations.

The participants consider the implications of such a connection, including the potential for cloneality in computational terms, where sending out a message or probe might inadvertently lead to other civilizations undergoing a similar transcendence. This could homogenize the diversity of consciousness and thought across the galaxy. To prevent this, it is posited that advanced races might adhere to a non-interference policy, known as the prime directive, to preserve the unique development of younger civilizations like humanity.

The conversation touches on the importance of diversity within cultures, the value of argumentation and difference, and how these aspects are highly valued in contemporary human culture. The discussion also alludes to the complexity of black hole physics and the differing opinions among scientists on these matters, with a nod to the works of Hawking and Thorne.

In essence, the dialogue explores the philosophical and ethical considerations of advanced civilizations' interactions, the preservation of diversity, and the potential consequences of instantaneous inter-civilizational communication through transcendence mechanisms. The conversation concludes with a suggestion to pause and reflect on these ideas over some tea, with plans to continue the discussion in future meetings.
