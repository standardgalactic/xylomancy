Howdy! The goal of this series of classes is to make you fall in love with bioinformatics.
Whatever you are studying now, computer science or biology or mathematics, we want you to
consider bioinformatics as well. Why? Because bioinformatics is a new frontier in all these
disciplines and because it is built on all of them. I first learned about bioinformatics
when I was completing my PhD in discrete mathematics a quarter-century ago. And the moment I heard
about this futuristic new discipline on the interface of computing and biology, I instantly
switched and never looked back. At that time, bioinformatics was an obscure discipline,
but today it is a huge field that is making a digital revolution in biology and that opened
the era of personalized medicine. But one thing has not changed. Bioinformatics remains the same
frontier, the same wild west as it was a quarter-century ago. And that is why we are wearing this crazy
outfit. You mean apart from the fact that they look good on us? Sure. In this specialization,
we're going to discuss many questions that are asked in modern biology and medicine,
such as which animal gave us SARS? Or do we have a clock gene? Or how is it that we find disease
causing mutations? After we ask each of these biological questions, we'll then learn about the
computational approaches that are used to solve them, from clustering algorithms to evolutionary
tree construction to machine learning approaches. Along the way, we're going to travel back in time
to solve a 300-year-old mathematical problem. Wander around Manhattan as tourists. We'll even
get lost in a Japanese casino run by Yakuza. All of these adventures may sound like risky
propositions, but we hope that you will join us to see what they have to do with bioinformatics.
Although these instructors may appear crazy, they are not quite as mad as they look. Dr.
Pavel Pevzner is a distinguished professor of computer science at the University of California,
San Diego, and a leading authority on bioinformatics. He's dressed this way because he sometimes thinks
that he's a sheriff of bioinformatics, a frontier discipline underpinning the digital revolution
in biology and personalized medicine. Dr. Philip Campo is an assistant professor of computer science
at Carnegie Mellon University. To learn why he is dressed this way, you'll need to take this course
or read the textbook by bioinformatics algorithms and active learning approach co-authored by the two
speakers.
