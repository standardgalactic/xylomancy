Processing Overview for AINIRO
============================
Checking AINIRO/Why we made Magic Closed Source.txt
1. **Background**: You started working on Magic (an open-source project) in 2019, and have since made nearly 8,000 commits to its GitHub repository, with the overwhelming majority being your own work. The intellectual property for Magic is wholly owned by you, and while you have received no direct financial benefit from Magic itself, it has indirectly helped propel the success of a company called iNiro, which has seen revenue growth of 395% over the past six months.

2. **Usage and Contributions**: Magic has been downloaded over 10 million times across its 42 packages, but users have not contributed to the project in terms of code, financial support, or public acknowledgment of its use. It appears that many users are leveraging Magic to appear as if they have larger teams, without disclosing their use of the tool.

3. **License Change**: Due to the realization that you have not benefited financially from Magic, despite others making money from it, you have decided to transition Magic from an open-source project to a closed-source, commercial offering. You have changed the licensing terms to require payment for access to the source code and use of the software.

4. **Commercial Model**: The new model introduces pricing tiers, with $5,000 per month for single server licenses and $20,000 per month for Kubernetes cluster licenses. This change reflects the significant value that Magic provides by enabling a single developer to perform the work of many senior software developers.

5. **Rationale**: You believe that the shift to a paid model is fair, as Magic has become a valuable tool that saves companies money and resources. By charging for its use, you are seeking compensation for your work and the intellectual property you've developed over the years.

6. **Outlook**: The future of Magic is now a commercial product, and users interested in leveraging it will need to pay for the privilege. You hope that this change will bring financial recognition and reward for your efforts and contributions to the project.
