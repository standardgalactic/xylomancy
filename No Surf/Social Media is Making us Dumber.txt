The average individual today spends around 7 hours a day on the internet, with almost
3 of those hours spent on social media.
The latest figures suggest that by the end of this year alone, we will have spent upwards
of 12 and a half trillion hours online.
The effects of a society that's terminally online are starting to show.
The debate and discussion are dead, replaced with Twitter threads.
Political discourse reads like a Reddit forum.
In a world with information available at our fingertips, the average person is becoming
more and more uninformed, opting to read clickbait headlines that distort our view
of the world and of each other.
This begs the question, is social media making us dumber?
This is Eric Fransen, professor of computer science at KTH University.
His research focuses on short-term memory and methods of neurological impairment.
He says that,
A brain exposed to a typical session of social media browsing can easily become hobbled by
information overload.
The problem begins in a system of the brain known as working memory.
Working memory enables us to filter out information and find what we need in the communication.
But it's also a limited resource.
At any given time, the working memory can carry up to 3 or 4 items.
And when you try to store many things in your working memory, you get less good at processing
information.
The constant distractions we are experiencing make it impossible to work or study.
Take for instance the average TikTok session where videos are typically under a minute
long.
Users scroll through hundreds of videos destroying their short-term memory which can only focus
on a handful of items at a time.
Imagine this issue compounded over weeks, months, and years, chipping away at our brain's
capacity to process information, making us a shell of our former selves.
And the results are finally starting to show on a societal scale.
They used to say you're an average of the 5 people you surround yourself with.
That saying is outdated.
Social media is not what you spend the most time with and it's influencing how we think
on a massive scale.
They don't call them social media influencers for no reason, do they?
So this begs the question, how exactly does it influence us?
As human beings, we require observation of our surroundings to build mental models and
understand the world around us.
Therefore, whoever owns what we see owns what we think.
Social media companies do this by distorting our view of the public square.
Take for instance Twitter, where the top 10% of tweeters are responsible for 80% of tweets,
where users are on average younger, more formally educated, and wealthier than the average American.
Is this truly representative of society at large?
Of course not, but it's designed to seem that way.
It produces something called the herd mentality, where people can be influenced by their peers
to adopt certain behaviors.
For instance, if everyone on your feed seems to be doing something, well chances are you
will too.
Can't believe they caught me lacking.
Huge ceiling tile is gone.
View board pens have been finessed.
This was the devious licks trend, which caused pandemonium over schools in the US.
Students began stealing from their school and posted it under the hashtag devious licks,
amassing millions of views.
The algorithm pushed this because its main purpose is to increase engagement and keep
you on the app.
This proves that millions of people can be pushed to do something just by having it show
up repeatedly in their feeds.
No wonder why we are losing the ability to be creative and critically think.
If everything we do is simply what we see on social media, are we truly unique or simply
carbon copies of what's trending?
There are even services available that allow you to purchase likes and followers on TikTok,
Reddit and many other social media platforms, leading many to question how organic these
trending pages are, if at all.
Comparison is a thief of joy, and in this attention economy, all we ever do is compare
because that's what these apps promote.
Think about it, when's the last time you've seen the TikTok algorithm promote a healthy
lifestyle filled with purpose and meaning rather than vanity and avarice?
In fact, according to TikTok's own internal documents, they instructed moderators to
suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor or disabled for the platform, reducing
a human being to our most primal of instincts.
Looks Social media is causing body dysmorphia at
record rates never seen before.
Apps like Facetune, which are used to enhance photos, are exploding on the app store garnering
hundreds of millions of downloads.
In fact, Facetune recently raised $130 million from investors after 90% growth in their user
base during lockdowns.
The constant push for unrealistic and frankly impossible beauty standards is causing many
to feel depressed and anxious, pushing them towards plastic surgery, which is booming
like never seen before.
All this is destroying people's self-esteem, causing them to hate themselves and their
genetics, reducing us to a lifestyle of eat, sleep and scroll, day in and day out, wasting
our life force enriching and envying others while doing nothing to improve ourselves.
Imagine a life without social media.
A life filled with purpose and meaning.
A life where we're free from the constant competition and envy.
A life that we can have simply by turning off our screens and returning to the way we've
always lived.
