Checking Akamai Developer/18 Commands That Will Change The Way You Use Linux Forever.txt
1. **Tailing a Log File**: You can monitor a log file in real-time by using the `tail` command followed by the filename of the log (e.g., `tail -f /var/log/syslog`). Pressing Enter will start displaying new entries as they are appended to the log. To exit, press Ctrl+C.

2. **Truncating a File**: If you want to clear the contents of a file without removing it (which is safer for log files that services might recreate), you can use the `truncate` command with the `-s` option to set the size to zero. For example, `sudo truncate -s 0 /path/to/your/file.txt`. Be cautious as this will remove all content from the file.

3. **Using the `column` Command**: To improve readability of command outputs that are jumbled or spread wide, you can pipe the output into `column -t`. This will format the output into neat columns, making it easier to read, especially in a terminal with limited width. For example, after running `mount`, you can use `mount | column -t` to see a cleaner and more organized list of mounted file systems.
