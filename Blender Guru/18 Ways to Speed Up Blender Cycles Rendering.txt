All right, come on Blender, let's see what you got.
Yes, it finished!
One frame, only 16 hours.
Okay, so let's see.
Per frame, 16 hours for a 1000 frame animation should get done in about 6 months.
Which is before Christmas.
Eh, that's alright, let's do it.
Hello?
Hello, can you hear me?
it worked! it worked! hello it's me it's you in the future I'm calling you from
2030 hi really because it looks like you haven't aged a day well yeah I mean I
wear a lot of sunscreen what can I say but listen you need to know render times
are important yeah okay because if you spend too long rendering then you'll end
up like me living in a box on the side of the highway poor desolate a piece of
chewing gum on the soul of society I'm homeless right so because I rendered for
too long I ended up homeless basically I spent so long rendering that well I was
never able to develop my skills as an artist because I was rendering so much
and then so I was never able to get a job also meth right copious amounts of
meth I'm sure yeah listen the sky's going black again so I haven't got much
time but I need to give you the advice that might just save your life it's the
18 ways to speed up cycles okay well just email it to me or something can you
do that no no in the future we don't have email it's all like cerebral uplinks it
funny story actually it was the downfall of society like the nanoparticle base of
the pain and what collapsed okay it's breaking up okay okay all right listen
I'll fax it to you fax it who's got a fax machine yeah I know the hipsters they
brought it back it's done fine but I don't have one don't all right listen I've
just sent it
Andrew with great power comes great responsibility rest easy on the wicked for they have not seen the truth also don't touch meth
but helpful you know the best kind of weird so that's what we'll do in this
video we'll go over the 18 ways to speed up cycles rendering these aren't well
these aren't like a checklist that you must follow but they're sort of helpful
tips you know if you want to shave off seconds or maybe you're rendering a big
feature-length animation you know one of the first for blender and and you want
to see how to improve it this is gonna go over all of the ways that I know of
how to do it so let's get to it number one reduce your light bounces light
bounces what are light bounces Andrew well light bounces are something that
happens in the real world and in 3d software it's when light hits another
surface it bounces off that surface and it'll hit another surface it'll bounce
off that surface etc etc to infinity in the real world but in 3d software that
bouncing process is a very processor expensive task so you pay for that in
your render times so there's a value in blender which will allow you to set the
maximum the minimum and the maximum amount of light bounces that happen in
the scene and by default it's set to 12 which I think personally is a little bit
too high so for example this is a classroom scene which has eight light
bounces set at maximum right okay this is how it looks at eight right now what
I'm gonna do I'm overlaying a grid over here and we've got along the x-axis the
number of bounces what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cycle through these bounces
here and in the background the render is changing with this graph okay it's an
interactive demo right so you can see that up until about four light bounces
there's no difference no difference at all and that's basically my guess is
there wasn't actually any extra light to bounce around so four was the maximum
and then after about four you can see three two one you can see that the glass
becomes opaque but don't worry about that I'll show you a fix for that in a
second and then finally zero down at the bottom there so zero there's a big
change you'll notice the biggest difference between no bounces and one
bounce okay so in my opinion other than the glass you don't need anything beyond
one light bounce for this scene which means you can save a considerable
considerable amount of time so instead of going from eight light bounces if you
went to one you'll be rendering at 48 seconds instead of 95 which is a huge
savings now I know you're probably thinking hey yeah but that glass looked
really horrible there so we still want the glass to look nice well actually the
the settings over here these these are the bounce six this is where you would
change it so these are the broad values here the maximum minimum for the whole
scene but you can also set it individually for your transparency and
your transmission and all the different ones there so all you would have to do
is just set these diffuse and glossies down to one and then just make sure that
the transparency is set to at least three or four or something like that and
that would be it and you would be able to save a huge amount of render time a lot
people don't know that but it's a really easy way you can do it okay number two
use portals portals does he mean these portals no not those portals I'm talking
about blender's portals so when you are making an interior scene in blender
which is like you know a room and you have a window in which there is light
coming in through the window from particularly an HDR but any environment
light basically you've got a lot of light calculation because it's actually
lighting the outside of your room and then some of that light is going in
through the window well that's that's wasted information right that there's
too much you know that that's being wasted there so what you can do is over
the window if you place one area lamp and then in the lamp settings if you
check a box that says portal what that will do is it will tell blender
essentially where the window is so make sure that you get the light in through
here and don't worry so much about the rest of it
it's a it's huge once you see it have a look at this
so this is with no portals all right you can see very grainy I'm hoping you can
see that in the youtube compression but it's a very very grainy image
now when we add one portal sorry two ports because there's two windows
look at the difference from super grainy to almost completely clear
okay which is crazy now you can see the render time does actually go up
by 30 seconds which is not much so that's not really a fair comparison
because really you know the whole point of a render is to get rid of the noise
so if we were to without portals at all try and get it to the
to that level I would have to double or probably even triple the amount of
samples so just for this comparison to make it fair
you can see that you would have to really go double or triple your render times
to try and get it without portal so it's a huge saving so make sure that if you're
making an interior scene all the architects out there watching this
if you hadn't learned about portals before I'm hopefully this will save you a
lot of time in the future use them and uh yeah it's really really handy so
again that's where to find it and I've got a
tutorial in the description if you want to watch it but it's super easy to use
all right number three use your GPU now some of you older blender users
perhaps would say yeah come on everyone knows that
well not necessarily um especially a lot of beginners they will not know that
you can actually with blender you can render
with either your CPU or your GPU so there's most computers have two and
generally speaking and this is where oh excuse me let me get a drink
that's where you change it you change it in the uh device setting right there you
can set it to GPU um and if you don't see that by
the way if you only see CPU there if you go to file user preferences
system in the bottom left hand corner you should see underneath compute device
something that says CUDA if you don't see something that says CUDA and your
graphics cards underneath it then you don't have a card that is supported in
blender right now AMD is not supported in blender
so I mean that they're working on it I just don't know when it's gonna happen
so Nvidia yeah you would see it there and generally speaking
Nvidia you know GPUs whatever they render a lot faster than a CPU
so this is just one example here but you can see that it's it's saved a
render time of 33% and that's you know that's probably with a really
good CPU as well so that's a considerable savings
but the really really cool thing about GPUs and the reason that there's there
was such a game changer for the industry like
five years ago um is that you can add more graphics cards to your computer but
you can't add more CPUs like if you wanted to upgrade your CPU
you first of all won't get that much of a bigger difference over your last CPU
but not only that like you can't put two CPUs in your computer
at least not usually right so if you wanted to upgrade your CPU you
would have to upgrade your motherboard which means you have to upgrade your RAM
which means forget it I might as well just get a whole new computer
whereas a GPU can be taken out and put into another computer
no problems so it's a very easy investment if you want to
halve your render times you can purchase two graphics cards
and it will render it in half the time because it's a linear sort of growth so
three graphics cards four graphics cards is going to render four times faster
than one graphics cards uh card so yeah it's it's a huge huge thing so make
sure that if you've got a GPU and you can use it use it whenever possible
number four change your tile size so this is another
really important one that a lot of people don't realize
is so important um tiles what are tiles well
tiles are when you hit the render key those little blocks
that appear on the screen that slowly reveal your render
those are tiles and the size of your tile is defined in the render settings
underneath tiles x and y by default it's set to 64
which is not really ideal for most people's um
whatever they're they're rendering on okay the size of your tile
depends on whether what whether you're working on a cpu or gpu
the tile sizes should be different in fact the exact opposite
so if you're working and you're rendering on a cpu
the smaller your tile size the best coming in at about 16 by 16 pixels
the better it will be if you if you go larger for cpu the worse it will be
and on gpu is the opposite the larger your tile size
the better the renderings will be so you could see that you could considerably
like if you accidentally were rendering at a really small size on the gpu
you could take forever to render the scene
because it's you've got the wrong tile size right so you can have huge memory
sorry render time improvements just by changing the tile size
as a general rule of thumb smaller tile sizes work better for cpus
i just use 16 by 16 every single time works for me
um and the bigger tile sizes for gpu's maxing out at about 512 by 512
generally speaking is better um now different gpu's
different tile sizes will work better i've heard that like different
architectures for in a video like a kepler card or a tesla card
some of those use better with like rectangle shapes i don't know why
um but just when you get a new card just do some tests and figure out what your
optimal size is for your card because that'll save you a lot of time in the
future all right i've got to get another drink
here i think this office is really dry
my throat's getting raspy all right number five reduce your samples
yeah you might say duh you got to reduce your samples
but okay first well what are samples i know a lot of you do but let's talk about
samples samples most of you know as that grain that
appears over your image okay so the whole point of
rendering is to try to reduce that grain and you do that by
increasing your samples which you can define in your
render settings right there so obviously the higher
the render sample amount you set it to the longer your render times are going
to be but the clearer your your final image will look
so basically you want to try and set it to a higher value for your final render
and yeah but the problem is is that i see a lot of people using incredibly
high sample amounts to the point that there's no point in doing it that high
so for example here is a scene set at 10 000 samples
and here's the same scene again set at 2500 samples
one quarter of the number of samples as before now as i flick back between them
can you see a difference no you can't because it's indistinguishable to your
you can't see any difference between them and yet
the 10 000 samples one took most of the day to render
and the 2500 rendered in less than an hour and a half
so huge time differences there but very very little difference between the
actual images so there's a point where the samples
that the point of going any higher is pointless so you want to try and find out
what is the optimal amount because while this might sound like
an exaggeration like yeah who would go to 10 000
have a look on blender artists um you'll see some people that are rendering
their scenes like i've seen some with like 50 000 samples
and they said they let it render for 48 hours thinking what are you doing
there's no reason to go that high that's just insane
it's just a waste of power a waste of your time more importantly
and it's just don't go that high okay keep it keep it as low as it needs to be
speaking of noise and samples there is a new feature
in blender 2.79 called denoising and it is going to be a game changer
now i've only just played around with it for a little bit but i'm going to show
you here what it does denoising does this it takes that grainy image
and then it applies a like a post processing step i believe
on top of it which will make it appear clear and smoothed out
so it's a big deal and it's going to be a huge deal for the blender community
once everyone sees it it's like whoa this is
this is going to make a lot of difference you're going to see it from now on
like in the future most renders are going to be using a denoiser
because for example here is my bathroom scene and i'm hoping you can see it in
the youtube thing but this is a very very noisy image
very noisy i would never use this as a final image
however when i applied the denoise filter on top of it
it looks like a final render it's amazing i
i don't i don't properly understand how it works because i haven't really
researched it that much but it's it looks like black magic
it's like sorcery it's like um so yeah okay now the difference between
these two here you can see that the denoising step
applies a small like it is it does actually add something to the render
but again it's not a fair comparison to say that the denoise one took longer
because the whole point is to make a clearer render so it's saving you
let's say if you had to double the or sorry quadruple the rendered time
it's saving you considerable amounts of time
especially for animations like like i can i can now looking at this i can say
like wow i can finally do an architectural animation now
because before like interiors are just horrible just noise absolutely
everywhere but with this it's going to make it possible so i'm
really really excited about this feature and i think once the community sees
that they're going to go ballistic um but yeah try it out it's uh it's really
fun in 2.79 it'll be uh it'll be in there for everyone
i'll probably do a tutorial on it if people want it um but there you go
all right number seven this is one a lot of people don't realize but
you should be using the latest blender version because there are big differences
between all the versions of blender and newer versions pretty much every
newer new version of blender they try to improve on the render times
of the one before it and they're always doing improvements
so uh this is i did this one a couple of years ago but comparing
2.64 to 2.71 basically like a year of releases there
you can see considerable time savings and this is for both cpu and gpu
cpu especially they've been able to really crush the render times
in each consecutive later release so it's uh it's it's just going
it's going crazy um so make sure that you are using the latest version
sounds like a no-brainer but you know i still see emails from people
where they're like hey um you know i'm using 2.66 so i don't have that feature
and i think why why and they're like ah well you know i just
that's the one i've got so i don't i like how it works so i don't want to
install the latest one it's like you can do that and you know i'm
more for making life simple but you're going to be paying for it in your
render time so make sure you're using your latest version
please um again i haven't done it for 2.78
whatever on now but yeah it just it's going down
okay all right number eight this is an interesting one a lot of people don't
realize but actually different operating systems and by
that i mean you know windows mac linux they have
different rendering times um because it is supported on every
platform which is fantastic and most software you can't do that
but there are different times between them so here i've got two tests
just testing between windows and mitt which is linux
a linux distribution um and you can see that for gpu there's almost no
difference in fact in most examples i found windows performs better on
windows sorry gpu's perform better on windows than
they do on linux um however for cpu linux kills it
so linux is really good at cpu's um not as great with gpu's because i think
they put a lot more effort into the drivers for windows because there's
gamers on it obviously um but yeah it's really good with cpu's
so that's just something to keep in mind i wouldn't just immediately rush out and
go and get linux don't feel you have to do that or that you're missing out
because you're using windows i've known about this for years
and i use windows um and that's just because it makes my life easier because
that's where all the software is i can play games on it as well
and it's just i don't see i'm happy to eat the render time
uh but you know hard cool people out there if you really want to cut down on
the render times this is why a lot of render servers by the way if they use
linux because it's just optimized and just performs so much better so
yeah you might be wondering hey andrew what about mac where does mac fit into
that i have no idea i'm gonna throw it to you
guys do you guys have a mac that also has windows and linux
because i searched for it online and i didn't see anybody that had one
like a triple boot system um so if you do it'll be great to
test out the render times between them i'd like to see it um
yeah post it in the comments if you do all right number nine
clamp it what do i mean by clamp it wouldn't you like to know
clamp it what's clamping other than that meaning
clamping is okay so you know sometimes when you render a scene
you see in the background you sometimes see these tiny little
flex little tiny grains of light okay those are called
fireflies and oftentimes no amount of extra rendering like increasing your
samples will get rid of those so you can't get rid of those fireflies
sometimes they're just there they're usually caused by small light sources
or core sticks or a bunch of different things um but you can
get rid of them by changing your clamp settings in the render settings there
i will say you this should be used as a last resort and i'll explain at the end
why um but it can be done so say for example you
have this teapot scene here and you can see that in the background there
you've got a lot of grainy noise okay well if you were to clamp it you can
see that it goes away immediately so this is uh without
clamping and then this is with okay big change
um so that's that's going to save you a lot of time because you don't have to
use as higher um a sample amount so that's that's a huge
improvement there now again that is where you can find it the
clamp direct and indirect however i i use it as a as a last resort so
to me i use it like a get out of jail free card if nothing else works
that's when i do the clamping and the reason i don't use it all the time
is that by clamping it's going to bring down the values
of yes the fireflies in the background it'll clamp those values down
but it will also clamp down every other value in your scene
so you can see with this teapot here the difference between them
i'm losing some brightness in the rim there because when i clamped it
i had to uh i had to get rid of some of that brightness in the teapot which i
didn't want to do but i had no choice so that is something to keep in mind
um just keep it in mind um generally also zero is turned off
and then the higher the value the better because
um the higher the value it's going to allow more light values to get through
and then you just turn it down gradually and see when the fireflies
disappear um and generally speaking you only want to use
indirect not direct but yeah it's up to you so like if you have like light
shining in on the floor that's a big part of your scene
if you just clamped it you're going to lose all that brightness in the uh in
the floor so that's why i use it sparingly
number 10 speaking of fireflies caustics the largest cause of them
so caustics for those who don't know are like if you've got a glass of water on a
table the light shines through it you see
that weird little like light pattern that appears on the table
that's refractive caustics um you can also have reflective caustics which is
when light bounces off a surface onto another surface
and it creates like an interesting light pattern so those are two different
types of caustics and they are very uh processor intensive
for for a renderer right and they often cause more problems than they're worth
so there is two little check boxes in your render settings enabling you to
turn them off and sometimes turning them off can save you a lot of time
so for example this is an image of a glass of water on a table
or floor i guess that's a big glass of water let's be honest
um but you can see there um you've got that nice
light shadow on the ground there but if i was to turn it off you can see that
there's no light shadow however the render times were a lot faster
so this is the difference between the two there 31 faster
without the caustics however you could argue that the whole point of this scene
is to see the light shining through the glass so you would obviously want to
leave it on but honestly for a lot of scenes
it's just it's more trouble than it's worth and for probably 95 percent of all
my renders i've ever done i just leave it turned off because it it's just
so commonly the cause for those fireflies to appear in your scene
i just don't like it and i just i don't see the point in most of the time
so i usually leave it turned off but there you go okay so
number 11 let's talk about object instancing
what is object instancing so say you have one tree
like this right and you want to make two trees so you take that tree
you hit shift d and you duplicate it now you have two trees however as well as
two trees you've also doubled up on the amount of memory you've used
and your render times as well because it has to now
cache that mesh essentially um so by duplicating it i have doubled the
amount of information in the scene not so great especially when they are an
identical tree so what you can do is you can use
object instancing so that they share the same object data
so for example with this uh with this leaves here selected if i select these
other leaves shift select then hit ctrl l here underneath make links if i
select object data now up here in the object
data panel you can see that next to the object there is now a
two number next to it because there are now two objects using that same object
data and you'll know that they're connected because if you were to edit
one of the meshes like say make that all the way out there
then you can see that they both have that change okay
but you say okay uh but i've got a number of different objects here okay i've
got i've got tree branches i've got a bunch of different stuff going on
i don't want to have to do that every time i duplicate something well
if you want to duplicate something but you want to
keep that object information if you use alt d alt d instead of shift d
the same thing happens you've duplicated the tree however it's
automatically made them share the same object data
so this means a lot for your final render so this is
very simple scene with a bunch of trees on it and this is with them set to
single users meaning i duplicated them the wrong way i did
shift d instead of alt d okay they're all spread out there
okay you can see that the render times two minutes
42 seconds and six gigabytes of RAM which is incredible amount
however if it's instanced i halved the render time
and i more than i decreased the memory used by a hundred times almost
just by using instances instead of actual like
single objects for each one so huge savings there
and i'm ashamed to say it took me like six years of using blender
before i even realized that object instances were a thing
so don't feel bad if this is the first time you're finding out about it
i'm hoping it's news to a few of you out there so use that
and you'll save a lot of render time and memory which means that you
more likely you can render it on your graphics card so anyway
there you go cool now let's talk about adaptive subdivision
hmm sounds technical well this was something that again is a very new
feature it only came out i think in the last release or two
um but what it allows you to do is say you have an
a scene like this where there's a lot of depth in your scene so you've got stuff
that's in the foreground you've got stuff that's in the background so a lot of
nature scenes interiors all that kind of stuff they
have this going on well the detail that you need to
see in the foreground is different to the amount of detail you need to see in
the back the background you can get away with very low
poly objects but in the foreground you want to have higher poly objects
so adaptive subdivision allows you to do that you just check one box in your
modifier settings there to use the adaptive subdivision
and now it will subdivide it depending on how close it is
or how far it is from the camera and that has big savings for your render
times so check this out this is where it turned off
okay renders in 21 minutes uses 12 gigabytes of
of memory now with it enabled it's 14 minutes
and it's used a fraction of the amount of memory
okay huge amounts of savings so this is why i was so excited when it came out
um i made a whole tutorial on it by the way if you want to see it um it's in the
description you can check it out but it's such a huge
feature um so yeah it's really important so especially
for nature scenes do make sure that you make use of this
new cool feature number 13 remove alpha transparency
so this is you know fairly scene specific now we're getting into
um but this is a big one so what is alpha transparency so this is when
particularly when you're making trees or plants or anything like that
sometimes you want to have a leaf and the leaf maybe has like
interesting little bits on the like frilly bits on the outside there
and you want to make sure that it has that frilly bit in the render so you
can actually use the alpha channel of the leaf
um so that it has that nice frilly pattern there
um as opposed to if you were to just model around it you know in a blocky
shape you wouldn't get that pattern there so it looks nicer with alpha
transparency however you pay for it in render times
significantly so here is a tree with alpha transparency it took 29 minutes to
render without alpha transparency the blocky method
it's 16 minutes to render almost half the render time
and honestly there is very very little difference between them in the
in the final render you can actually see like a bright green
outline there but that's only because i think it was just as an example on this
render to show you where it is but you shouldn't see that if you've modeled
this correctly if you're if you're making a tree i
i'm ashamed to say i didn't even realize this and i was making trees for ages
um i thought that using alpha transparency was the way to go because
it makes a better looking leaf and i didn't realize it was adding anything
to the render times but significant amounts so
just crazy so make sure that if you're making a tree or a plant
that you are using the blocky leaf shape um and don't worry about the alpha
transparency because you'll pay for it it's just too expensive so forget it
all right number 14 reduce the strand count so again very niche depends on
your scene but strands basically it's the particles
so it could be grass it could be what could it be
um it could be hair on a character's head or it could be rug
on a lounge room floor it's a very expensive thing to
render all that every single one of those particles so you pay for it so this
is with 145 thousand particles with five children strands for each
36 minutes 65 thousand however is 26 minutes so there's a big
difference between that and you know you might think you know maybe it's not
that bad i might go with the extra you know 145 and that's fine you can do
that but just know that the the more strands you you add into it the longer
you're going to be paying for it a lot of people don't realize that they try and
use like a full-on million particle
ground or something like that and then wonder why they can't render
so just know it's a very intensive task let me get another drink here gosh
number 15 coming to the end remove volumetrics volumetrics what are
volumetrics well you might already know but it's like fog um it's when the
light shines through something or it's just fog in a scene right so this
was a new feature well new ish two or three years ago they added it but you
can now render volumetrics which is very very cool
it's also very very expensive in terms of rendering
so here's a scene with volumetrics very cool scene
and here's it without volumetrics obviously with looks a lot nicer and
that was actually the whole point of this scene was to show off the volumetrics
but um you can see that it does add significant amounts to the render time
about 40 percent almost extra and it looks a lot looks a lot grainier as well
maybe my throat is as well so you have to you have to be aware
like when you're building a scene know that when you if you're just going to
add some fog or whatever if it's a tiny little bit of fog like do you really
need it because you're going to be paying for it with your render time so use it
when necessary um sometimes for this scene it makes a lot of
sense but for your scene just consider it okay
so number 16 speaking of things to cut you can also cut the sss which is
subsurface scattering so subsurface scattering is something that you might
have seen if you hold your hand up to the light
or if you're talking to somebody and the sunlight's behind them you see it
through their ears but it's light as it's traversing through an
object it will shine through on the opposite side
that's called a subsurface scattering um and there is a special
shader for that um in your node settings so yeah
basically if you're making a character that's really the really the only time
you use it another example might be food um
like a glass of milk or something you can sometimes get it there but mostly
just characters um yikes
scintill the sequel scintill my precious um you forget you forget how good
hair looks until you you don't have it anymore right
i'm sure a lot of men have realized that um with sss you can see it renders in
four and a half minutes but if you use no sss at all um it's a fraction of the
time so it's a very expensive shader to use um
so i would agree that it does actually look better with subsurface scattering
if you don't use it for a character that the skin sort of looks waxy no not
waxy it looks like like hard concrete or
something like you really need some light to be passing
through it so yeah i would say that you do need to use it in this case
um it is a lot to pay for though so you know you know when when when useful you
can use it otherwise i just don't write
number 17 enable mis what is mis you might ask
it looks like mi5 but it is not the same
multiple important sampling is what it stands for it's in the world panel
right down there little checkbox sort of hidden there um and there it is
what does it do well if it's turned off it might your scene might look like this
if it's turned on your scene might look like this
um now this is really only applicable if you have
uh lit your scene using an hdr environment light
um because i believe what it's doing is it's taking it from
you know an hdr with all its thousands of pixels and trying to find the light
values of each one and i think when you enable it it tries to
average it so you don't get that noisy some parts dark some parts bright
sort of mess going on it tries to average it i believe don't quote me on that
um but it has a huge huge impact and yeah i believe it's now turned on
by default but it used to be like this hidden
secret that some artists knew about and when they turned it on they were like
whoa my scene looks so much better but now i think it's turned on by
default so it's not as cool anymore you can't impress too many people with it
but for a while you could um so if you if you are rendering with an hdr
gotta make sure that that one is checked otherwise it's gonna look awful
um i mean basically it looks broken if it's if it's not enabled so that's i
mean it really shouldn't be called a performance improvement it should be
called like um is it right yes or no
with it checked it is correct so anyway finally the last one to leave on
because there was 18 cycles improvements we were going to talk
about these are the small performance improvements which
you can find in your render panel underneath performance
so these are the use spatial splits the use air bvh
use sorry save buffers and the persistent images
now here's the thing maybe you might have noticed this as i was cycling through
it but uh in these examples i didn't actually find
for these checkboxes to actually make an impact the first time we ran these
tests we were able to see uh an improvement
we did it for a different scene and we rendered like one frame and then we
stopped at another frame um and we were able to see an improvement
however i and then i recorded the start of this video and i call it the 18
you know ways to improve cycles or whatever and now i then i did some
three tests halfway through you know doing this tutorial
and then i wasn't able to reproduce it my point being
is that these small performance improvements
supposedly are supposed to improve the performance of cycles but i haven't
actually found that to be the case i found it to pretty well stay the same
whether their boxes are checked or whether they're not checked spatial
splits i've been told are supposed to increase
your memory slightly with a decrease in render speed
i didn't find that i found that render speed was about the same
by the way if you see like two seconds plus one or two whatever
factor that as zero improvement or change because
the system if you re-render i think twice without changing anything
it can usually come within a a hair of that anyway so
it's basically the same no difference use hair bvh
maybe five seconds faster with more memory it was actually supposed to be
when you check it use hair bvh it's supposed to use less memory
so i found it to be the opposite way with that one
not great but i did i spoke with andy koralsik on twitter and he said
from he heard from shurgey that this is really only impact it really only
impacts it if you've got motion blur so say you had grass blowing in the wind
like that and there was motion blur oh for agent 327
his hair was moving or whatever and apparently that really really taxed the
render times so this was supposed to solve that
um or it should solve that right but i wasn't able to replicate it sorry to
say i really yeah i wasn't able to do it save
buffers i've since learned andy told me that uh this is actually
was really only applicable to the render the blender internal rendering
engine and that cycles it won't make much of a difference
which explains why i wasn't able to get much of a difference from it
it was supposed to case your image textures
somewhere so that it's then able to reference them faster for your
extra frames then on i didn't find any improvement
and then we've got persistent images which i think also might be the same like
it doesn't apply to cycles i could be wrong on that
but i wasn't able to find any improvements um
so yeah so these i mean i feel bad ending on such a low note like i wasn't
able to uh to replicate this stuff but i do want to
include it because it looks so important and you see this stuff in the
performance settings and you've probably wanted like i've
wondered what do these buttons do should i leave them checked checked on
checked off does it am i paying for render times
because it's turned on or because it's turned off um
honestly in my opinion it doesn't make any difference
probably nine times out of ten the scene that you're rendering it's not going to
make any difference when you're doing a production like
they were doing for agent 327 you probably come across like one or two
frames where it just crashes or you get horrendously
long render times for this specific object and that's where
having a guy like sure gay the developer on your team
to go oh you've got to check the head bvh box
right that's when it's applicable but i think for the everyday artist
i mean this should really be hidden almost in like the user preferences
because it's that i feel like it doesn't make that big of a difference to
anyone um in my opinion that's just my opinion
um but yeah all right we discussed a lot
let's round it off we discussed a lot in um
this uh this little video the summary is on blender guru.com you can click the
link below that's what it says behind my shirt and microphone
link is below so i'm going to put the whole summary up there with images and
everything so you can just reference it in the future you don't have to listen
to my voice all over again you can just reference it on
there now if you look at this and you think boy
andrew that sure is a lot for the user to take in like
why don't those stupid blender developers
pull their head out and turn this stuff on by default or
make it automatic or something like that here's why
you a lot of these things you might seem like a no-brainer
like hey the everybody should be using gpu well not everybody has a computer
that supports gpu a lot of features don't work with gpu so having it on by
default isn't a good idea other things like portals how
would blender know whether you've got an interior scene or an exterior
where the lights coming from etc some of these things
you just have to it's when you're building the scene
it's only the the artist that's building it that can know
that this particular thing is is useful yes it's true some of this stuff
you would never know unless somebody told you but i think that's part that
comes with the territory some of it is becoming automatic like for
example use optimal tile size ton told me that
that's going to be in 2.8 or 2.79
but um yeah that's going to be automatic so hopefully you shouldn't have to
touch that in the future um and there's other stuff like
use denoising you could argue that should be an
automatic feature but you could also argue the other way
that it blows things in you know so you might not
not every artist needs it on by default so the whole like default argument
isn't as clear cut as it sounds so some of this stuff you do just have to know
so that's why i'm making this video because it's a common question a lot of
people have how do you improve render times and some
of the stuff you just don't know until you find it
so and the other thing is is that a lot of these things here you don't have to do
every time you make something it's just like some of this stuff like
volumetrics sss object interesting all that stuff that's
stuff that you once you know it now when you make a scene in the
future you'll know like oh if i add fog to this i'm
going to pay for that ideally so i might not do that or something like that
like you don't have to go through a checklist every time you render a scene
or maybe you'd want to do that anyway um but yeah you can just
yeah know about it um so as an example this is the uh
the scene that i started with on the on the first slide let's talk about let's
say i finished this scene and now i want to do an
animation i want to make the camera fly through the scene
now if i was just doing a still
i probably wouldn't worry about doing all
18 of these i would say you know if i can render it who cares i'm just going to
render it overnight i'm going to come back it's going to be fine
if i'm doing an animation it could mean the difference between
a two month long render and a five day render or a five hour render i don't
know um animations are so like it's just
obviously it's multiplied exponentially what is it exponential
whatever the the performance improvements you can make
like even down to fractions of a second can have big impacts over a you know
feature length film so for something like this i would go
through my checklist and i would say all right looking at my scene here
can i reduce the light bounces yes doesn't need portals
um i will make sure i use my gpu if possible make sure i'm using the
optimal tile size i don't worry need to worry about
clamping or reducing the samples because they're already optimized
denoising yes i want to make sure that i smooth it out instead of
you know having heaps and heaps of uh samples uh make sure i'm definitely
losing using the latest plan diversion that's just a no-brainer
object instancing absolutely if i had for all those duplicate cherry blossom
trees there if each one of those they were
individual single user objects i probably wouldn't even be able to render it
it would be so overblown in the memory so definitely make sure i'm using that
adaptive sub-dip definitely for the ground and rocks and things like that i
want to make sure i'm using that offer transparency absolutely make sure
that's eliminated from all my nature objects because that's a very
common scene where you would see it strand count
make sure i'm using the lowest amount of grass possible
volumetrics that's here's an example of like volumetrics
like you there's fog on those mountains there do i really need
true volumetric fog or can i get away with in doing it in the compositor
like a fakery sort of thing where it's not entirely accurate but i wouldn't be
paying for it as dearly doesn't need ssi because it's
hasn't got any people in it basically msi turned on yes if i'm using an hdr and
those small performance improvements right that's that's sort of the
checklist that i would run through as an artist if i was doing an animation
not every single scene that i make i go through this it's not like you know a
flight manifest you have to go through all the
checklists before you take off or whatever it's only if you absolutely
need to
give me a like no thank you for watching essentially this is the end
um if you found this useful do give it a like
and i do want to end by saying thank you to these people mason menzies actually
did a whole bunch of the tests basically most of the tests that you just saw a
painful job rendering for two hours coming back
rendering again but he did that so thank you to mason
the blender foundation for providing the cc source files
mike pan christoph soosh nick brunner and emirage provided some of those
render time test benchmark scenes and then rob garlington for the the artwork
for this tutorial um but that's it thank you for watching
hope it was useful and uh yeah send it to anyone who's got terrible render
times thank you for watching see you next time bye
