So welcome everybody, welcome back to some faces as well, it is so so exciting to
be sharing the space with you again this evening or newly this evening.
I'm really, it's the third session today of these kind of existential offerings live events
and I'm just starting to have it as something that I really really look forward to because
each session is so different and the discussions always leave me with so much to think about
and as ever I just want to kind of bring in that idea that even though we're just squares on
each other's screens we are real people in real time joining together and sharing this experience
and it's just so special. I know that some of the people here have bought tickets that are free,
some of them have donated, some of them have spent money, either way it's just so wonderful
because what we are giving all of us is is our time and that is so valuable and I'm so grateful
so thank you so much to the people that are live and watching for sharing your time and thank you
so much for the people that will watch this in the future for have using your time, this precious
time to be engaging with these existential ideas and even though we're in the present today we're
going right back to the past to explore ancient existential ideas with none other than Marcos
Maria Mendez who is joining us all the way from Argentina so thank you Marcos, we met in Athens
and I remember you were standing there kind of improvising your talk passionately about
Greek philosophies and how they're still relevant today and I just thought right
we need to have these ideas spread further so this is the reason that Marcos shares the space
with us today and I won't chatter and take up any more time, Marcos I just welcome you and
welcome you to introduce yourself. Well thank you it's a wonderful wonderful thing to be here
and yes in fact we met in Athens and well you might expect a little bit of the same things here
because not very much in the preparation of the of the topics but of the let's say combination of
many of the years of work and of study in these things and the the basic ideas governing the
the the centers of the of the talk so well thank you all for being here I'll say hello from Argentina
the other side of the world so thanks for taking the time to be here with us and yeah I'm not very
much for introductions I'm let's just say that I'm a clinical psychologist another have been for the
last almost 10 years and I find that existentialism at least those ideas and those concepts are very
helpful in the clinical practice in fact at some point I'd say that the existential dilemmas are
so central to the human experience that we can't avoid them and it's perfectly clear that one or
at the third point we all have to face those things so many people come to to the practice
and say okay I have this problem I have this big luggage on my back and I can't get rid of it so
the basic concept today will be that well these questions they they persist throughout history
and the idea of the existential school as a school of thought is well let's say has some certain
issues and I don't know if you if you're all familiar with the with the idea of existentialism
but and I repeat that anyone can can interrupt me if the if my words don't come clearly enough
the idea of existentialism is complex because the the basic thoughts are not very clear why
because we have existentialists that are atheists that are priests that are existential christians
agnostics so the basic ideas can be applied to many things the the the school of thought
just came to be at least formally with in France after the the second world war
I like that there is a lot of european public because well you might be all very much in touch
with the with the history of of that maybe not yourself but yes only on the generations before
you very different than the the experience we have here in in south america so after the
after the second world war the at least in France the ideas just started to be and well
I I think you you might have heard of of Jean Paul Sartre he monopolized the idea of the
existentialist he he just adored the the word which is very different from let's say albert
commuse which hated the the word existentialism he defined himself as an absurd absurdism
the absurd sorry if my if my pronunciation is I I find myself saying some words for the first
time in english because of course I've studied them in in spanish and so I apologize in advance if
some of the words don't come up very very very well so
you might have heard of the basic concept of Sartre that the existence precedes the essence
which is in a certain way I'm not trying to make a lecture about this because there are many far
better explanations for this I'm just trying to introduce the concept so that then we can
go towards the antiquity or the ancient times I think antiquity is just for the for the furniture
right no okay and the the idea of of the existence precedes the essence counts
in in an antagonistic way to the essentialism the the idea that Plato and Aristotle have
that everything has an essence and that everything has the thing that makes the thing what it is
not some other thing so if you if you lost that that would no longer be that thing the the basic
explanation is the knife you can have a handle that's plastic wood no handle at all but if you
take the blade it's no longer a knife so the essence is is that that characteristic which is
unsurparable from the thing itself so Sartre says you know that's not it what if what if we just
don't have any any essence and we create ourselves which is a way of thinking about it
which is a way that I don't particularly agree and and that's the thing I I don't agree in a way
with one of the most influential existentialists of the world and of history because well Sartre
never never did any clinical practice never studied the development of of the humankind
and how we come from a newborn to to something so there is in a sense a
well a school of thought that goes towards that thing okay no we're just a blank a blank canvas
and everything it's supplied which in a certain way has led to to many of the of the
serious aspects of of today this idea that word we're just what we what we choose to be
which is maybe not the case we have certain limits and the the development that the the
development of let's say the cognitive functions are of course rooted on on the body
so the the basic idea of Sartre might have been mistaken in a certain way but but it surely
has done some some good things for the for the confrontation of ideas which is in fact the
the basic concept we have here and and that we can talk about all those things
so the so the idea would be that that the that the the existentialists of the post-war
world war focused on the let's say an terminology of the understanding of the humankind
trying to incorporate the subjective experience of of the of the
of the person to the understanding of reality which is in fact up until today the the basic
framework of of existential psychotherapy phenomenology existential phenomenology
so it's a very interesting concept it's changed a lot of the of the way we thought of of the humankind
and in fact it's uh well very unique in its perspective i'm not saying Sartre just said
not so far along he he had many many great great ideas for example the idea of hell
which is not a new idea in itself but i don't know and please correct me if i'm not saying that the
title of the name correct in the right way it's behind closed doors might have been or something
like that in spanish is a puerta cerrada i think it's no exit in english no exit okay
that idea of the sartre and hell which is not no other thing than the people others
which is very unique and i can understand why he might might be able to to to think that way
but he missed the idea that the others are also the ones that introduce us to the world
so this idea that we're coming in in in a blank canvas is what to say the least
naive in fact he even said towards the end of his career in his life that he
he gave little importance to the material aspects of of human of human experience
which is again a very very very same thing to do to be able to see the the the errors of our past
but the idea would be that these questions the questions of death meaning
uh freedom sartres very much into into freedom this that the the whole
excess of freedom we have comes with with an angst comes with the suffering which is not
of the aspects of of this school of thought so it's all these questions have been since
the the beginning is of humankind so the the existentialism in a sense has been around
well for as long as we are here the questions are and persist so i thinking about about today
came up with a with a question myself why did we start calling existentialism at least the
formal school of thought after the the world war and i have no good answers sorry but there
there is an aspect that that i think it's crucial that it's that the the questions went further away
from religion than before so the greeks at least for our western traditions our focus
much more on the greeks than let's say on on on some other parts of the world
but they they made the same the same questions we do now exactly the same ones
one one could say well we we copied them and and how can it be that we have
haven't got any answers after so so long and and it came to me also a quote from a very good
psycho psychoanalyst and sociologist that's called eric from who said that the
that the technology advances much more than the wisdom we have so the wisdom we possess now
is not at all what what we need because well we're making the same questions as Plato we're
making the same observations as Aristotle and socrates so one must wonder if if we will ever
if we will ever find the answers and the questions for meaning well what is the meaning of it all
at least my answer is well there is no meaning which might be within the the school of thought
of existentialism that the the the branch of nihilism the nihilists the nihilists say that
well there is no apparent meaning and there is no god and there is no nothing that that can
actually give the meaning there i i would say there is a smaller branch that says positive
nihilism negative nihilism the negative nihilism would be the the character of of the sojelski
if if there is no god and there is no immortality then what what well then everything is permitted
in brother skramosov but there is also the positive nihilism which is okay there is no
meaning at all we are responsible for creating it we are the ones that that give life meaning
which is a powerful thing a very powerful concept to say that we are responsible but
it's also a burden it's also a very very harsh reality that we are responsible for ourselves
so well i think that if you're here now might be because you you you find yourself challenging
those ideas you find yourself wondering all of this because let's face it it's not a very popular
subject all of this you don't go to a party and say okay yeah but what what's the meaning of all of
this or i think okay do you all know we're gonna die someday you won't be very much appreciated in
the party so there is a certain element of of uncomfortableness in all of this a very deep
uncomfortableness i would say but it's also charged with with a very profound sense of wondering
and of course i i say to you to your you can you can ask the questions you need but i think
at some point we all have the the the wondering of saying okay but why why is this the way i live
why is this the way it suffer which is in fact one of the of the tools we use in psychotherapy
we we try and and and get the questions with with a certain sense of of weight behind them
not just the the hollow words again hollow words the words with with nothing behind them
to to find the person asking the right questions or at least the questions that
uh well they are able to to handle because it's very difficult to to face yourself with a question
that nobody can answer the you and the the ideas and the the problems these brings are uh well
uh i would say eternal but but it's a very and a very weird way of of talking about the human
experience because in fact the the human experience is finite so i'd say they they will accompany the
the the experience of for humankind but we individually have a very different way of approaching
it so i'll go back to to the idea of the of the ancients well
i also came across
i'll i'll take the opportunity to introduce all of the of the english-speaking uh audience or
participants to um maybe the greatest writer of of argentina which is Jorge Luis Borges
i don't know if you've known him but uh he's wonderful it's like reading Edgar Allan Poe and for for us
by at the at the last years of his life he was in a project of of of having the the most important
hundred books so he took the time to choose each one of them uh he didn't didn't didn't complete the
the um uh all the collection but he introduced uh in my in my curiosity one of the of the most
ancient stories the the epic of Gilgamesh which is a very odd a very odd uh well uh choice
but in there it's uh the the epic of Gilgamesh is the Sumerian that's a myth a story about a hero
which uh let's say simply he he faced a lot of challenges of course but the the most important
aspect is he was searching for immortality and well he didn't make it of course spoilers
spoilers for the for a very old book but in a certain way we can see the the question of
mortality even before the greek civilization in fact the epic of Gilgamesh inspired a lot of
the Iliad and the Odyssey so uh we find there the the well even the flood yes but also the the
the work on hell in hell sorry in hell that the the hero needs to go to hell to find something
Odysseus did it in the Odyssey Gilgamesh did it in in his epic but I'd like to say that
this this is the point there is something there that that goes beyond the the the basic story
the basic narrative which surrounds it to say okay they were wondering what would it be for
someone to look for immortality in a certain poetic way he found it because well we're we're
still talking about him so good for him but the the question lies there what is mortality and how
can we face it and we're still looking for answers today there is even a whole branch of psychology
that's that that that dedicates itself to the to the people that are dying and well it's very
it's very difficult for us to to to symbolize that so we tried a lot in a lot of of ways
but we are creatures of meaning we need meaning in our lives
and the in greek greece in Athens I mentioned the paraitolia and I don't know if it's
perfectly translated english if it's basically that but it's the principle of the brain
to look for patterns and to look for meaning in things even if if they are not there which
might have been a very evolutionary edge for us but it's still here with us that we need to look
for meaning I always at least when I work with teenagers I give the I give them the the idea
that color in itself doesn't exist it's like what are you talking about of course it exists I mean
look at look at all the the colors we have here well in fact color is a construction of the of
our brain it's not something let's say objective different animals different eyes see different
colors the colors are the reflection of the light that our eye and our brain are able to produce
but color in itself is not a thing which is very weird but which is again a testament of the
evolutionary presence of meaning in in not only in in our lives but but surrounding us
so they of course it's the it's the strange explanation but it's in fact the way it is
even if we if our experience is nothing like it so well these ideas go go towards mythology in
mythology at least the one I specialize in which is Greek mythology we find a lot of the of the
problems of existentialism so it's like existentialism is a new branch of of philosophy why would it be
so present over so many things so so long ago written and it's like well yeah because existentialism
has been around forever and there is a certain strange parallelism in in the idea of psychoanalysis
of conscious and conscious and in that's that's very well established in in mythology and philosophy
in the ancient world on one hand the idea of rationality as the great means of understanding
the universe and ourselves and in a certain way mythology just came around and saying
but these are the ways we we understand the world and ourselves so the the the great hero of Greek
mythology might be Odysseus the only mortal one the only purely mortal that he suffered a lot and
there we find one of the aspects that that I think actually defines existentialism that life is
is is tragedy and and there's nothing we can do about it of course we can we have all the
techniques and on all the the technology that allows us to live quite comfortable we're not
very hungry so often we're not very cold so often we have the entertainment we have medicine
yet there's nothing we can do with the existential dilemmas and
it comes to to mind now sorry if I if I keep on bringing stuff the the the the the soma
of all well of no sorry all well no 1980 no brave new world hoaxly
where the the drug that's just
implicated let's say or decreased all the the the suffering in in oneself and it's like
if we could do that if we had a drug which we have plenty of them but none that that are so
so uh at least so effective should we do it should we release the world from the suffering
and even if we if we can wouldn't there be a lot of people that saying okay but what if I just
bring this down if I burn this up if I punch this this person so
it's uh another well paradox of existentialism it's suffering something we need to avoid there
is something that makes us who we are and in a certain way
psychology deals with the suffering with psychopathology and of course I'd say that
again sorry sorry sorry that that I that I criticized him so much he he knew nothing of
psychopathology I don't know if you're aware that he even tried to introduce a he he he hated Freud
he absolutely detested him and there is a movie in the 1960s Freud the secret passion I think it's
called that Sartre wrote the the first draft of the of the movie well the director said no this
this just puts Freud in a in a horrible position why would you do that that script was discarded
but he tried to introduce a psychoanalysis even called existential psychoanalysis
which denied the idea of the unconscious now the unconscious is still today debated a lot
even if we at least here in Argentina psychoanalysis is quite popular and not so in in in Europe or
other countries I I found myself seeing that in Athens which I later called upon say okay
you're leaving behind a very useful tool that might be able to explain a lot of what's going on
so the the ancient idea of of the search for meaning is later present in religion that the
constitution of of the the big religions we have today as answers for the the the search for meaning
what does in a certain way religion do it gives you the the certainty of what happens beyond death
wonderful like now you know this is what happens and every religion
gives an answer so religion is quite useful in that way to to to release ourselves from the
the despair that can come from us also gives you okay this is the way you live this is the
way you need to to to conduct yourself which is again very useful and even even though in
psychoanalysis Freud was very harsh on religion he recognized the the usefulness it had
maybe he was too too naive to see that it's not about rationality the the thing of religion
it's about much more and it gives much more even today of course European
is going a little further away from religion as as people are even more educated but
the the rest of the world is another experience and we see we see it in the in the conflicts we're
having right now at least in the Middle East so these things are still present in the war
it's still present in in the in the world we we have it's like no but the the Greeks were
from war to war well that's not the Greeks that's humankind we just go from one thing to another and
we can even count the years in the world that there were no wars at all which are very few
so the the existential dilemmas are still here and they have practical aspects to it
there is even the the idea of what do we do with the with the intolerance and
uh you you guys over over Europe are much much closer to the wars than I am but
there is a specific aspect of saying okay what do we do do we fight for our survival
or are we able to to just talk about it what do you do and there is no no talk
uh no talk available so there is a in this there are also very practical aspects
in fact I think of another another story
um written by by Camus which takes the concept or the concept of Sisyphus I don't know if if all
of you know who Sisyphus is but he's a character from Greek mythology that that uh cheated on death
on two occasions and after that he was condemned by the gods to to well to Tartarus the hell of
the of the Greek world he was condemned to to carry a huge rock onto the top of the mountain
and at the end of the day exhausted he saw how it rolled over all over again so that he was
he had to to go uh again and again so he was condemned to meaninglessness
he was condemned to the labor and to the effort without any reward at all so
Camus many many years after takes that story to talk about suicide to talk about meaning
and to talk about a very difficult aspect of of reality that's saying okay why don't we kill
ourselves so he said all the questions of philosophy are are on second place towards the
question of suicide because on that we find ourselves asking okay what makes me want to
live the life I have so it's a very again don't talk about suicidal on parties because that's no
it's not an easy an easy subject yet it's a very important subject so it's a very very
when the the helpful organization talks about that they they they of course they give them the
thing the certain importance yet they struggle to to talk about it and just and to find them
the real reasons why people do it because it's a very difficult aspect and and a very difficult
thing to to understand it's a very personal experience so uh well it's uh course alarming that
that's almost one million of people are committed to a suicide a year according to the statistics
but it's also a very important thing to talk about because that's the maybe one of the most
existential problems we have because it faces us with with uh with our condition and why would
someone choose that there is I remember when I was working at um at the public hospital
that I I discussed this with a colleague of mine saying all suicide is psychopathological
because of course we can we can we can see you with someone with depression someone
maybe with with schizophrenia but it's all suicide like that
and it's a very difficult at least I haven't come upon the the question any other any other place
other than myself but it's um well it's very difficult to face those those problems
so oh we tend to avoid them and we can avoid them particularly in our societies which are
uh meant to distract us there is a very good book of Bargashosa sorry another Latin American
writer and it's called the the the civilization of entertainment she's very good
and very simple to to read maybe the translation should be should be good enough
but we can avoid it for so long for it punches us in the face because because we at least well
all of us will have to face death at some point maybe not ourselves but yes and the people will love
love we will have to to deal with suffering one way or another so this idea that the the world
decides a nice place where we should be comfortable might be very detrimental for us might be very
very very false
which in a in a certain way comes to the to the to the to the to the fight of ideas
very barely poorly equipped so
well i think of of the of the buddhist one of the of the four noble truths of buddhism
life is suffering and that's again we go to the antiquity we go to towards the
the these three fathers of thought which were socrates confucius and the buddha
which changed the way we understood things but none of them said that life is something
nice and something comfortable and something that that's a gift from the gods in fact they
they socrates well criticized a lot and and with good with good ideas the socratic method is still
present in us in our psychotherapy so the the the ideas of buddhan confucius all come towards
the questions of existentialism what should we do with our life how do we deal with death
how do we deal with suffering and are so inextricably linked with the with with ourselves that
we find that it's worth exploring all of these things even if we have no answer and of course
if you are here you are interested in one way or another for all of this and that the
the the the basic idea of existentialism which in this in this sort of activities and and channels
and and the offerings is a wonderful place to to explore this and to at least feel that the
suffering we might have is not unique to us because that's another thing that within the
the psychotherapy sphere we try and deal that the person comes saying okay i suffer
i suffer specifically my suffering is unique and to a certain point it is but the certain
aspects of that are absolutely shared between us so my my ideas would be to to
to find the way of of asking this to find and to find places where we can talk about all of this
maybe there are some some very good guidance in in all of these things and in fact we can even
help help other people in this network of existential branching for the for the difficult
aspects of life because i guaranteed you know someone who's struggling with all of this
if not yourself and that struggling is in a certain way the the the core aspect of of the
greek idea that there's a tragedy that's why they invented tragedy then came the romans that made
them the circus with the with the coliseum and the the entertainment of death but the greeks
and i think we have a mixture of greek and roman that's why we have i don't know the world cup
and that's fantastic as it is it's it's purely entertainment and but also we have the tragedy
we have the the movies and we have the the the art that connects us with that part of of ourselves
so i hope nobody nobody has has fallen into a silent despair but yes that we can we can
hear you and see what what you have to say about all of this of course there's a lot to
to to learn about ancient times and i think those three figures are a wonderful way of starting
i also recommend um uh carl jaspers then that he talks about all of these three figures uh no no i
think he changes socrates for jesus so he talks about the figure those those three figures us and
as a as a way of understanding who we are so uh i think it's uh it's later over there but i hope
everyone's uh wondering at least my idea would be that we we share questions not the the answers
because of course this is not a lecture that i have the the absolute truth and in fact it's more
of the of the experience we have and the and the the the ways we have of understanding ourselves
and our lives and the and the spaces we we uh we're in even if it's work family
and the these sort of places but how can we apply certain things of this towards the the
the concrete aspects of our lives
i think if any if anybody if anybody um
um uh finds finds yourself uh wondering how can we connect over this of course it's a very good
thing if you if you can talk and and say um i hope nobody's uh dizzy with all the the the
concepts and the ideas sorry if i if i branch uh too much
no it was exciting to follow all of the different branches and go on such a journey
in in my own thinking and our own thinking but then throughout history and just um i'm gonna
reiterate what what marcos is saying let's make this a discussion let's make this a questioning
a shared questioning together um and i think the question that comes for me or the kind of
discussion that exploration that comes for me is what you say about clients coming to us or
people coming to us or even for ourselves that in that moment our suffering feels like the most
unique and extreme experience of suffering that could exist and even as therapists even as coaches
even as reflective and intelligent beings that know that statistically historically that's not
the case but still somehow there's that sense that big sense if we're being approached or
confronting something in the future or in the moment or in the past that's incredibly difficult
for us that we are isolated in it um i suppose i don't want to speak for ages i would love for
other people to jump in can i can i ask yeah yeah tony go so lovely to see you and thank you so
much for doing these things awesome i mean i've had um i've in my life i've had five suicide
friends which i think is an exception of suicide friends and um the impact of that is may and i
you know i'm a deep absurdist or existentialist and you know my my question on a daily basis is
really is about resilience and opposing forces to this absurdity because i mean if you know i think
we all get that it's absurd um i think that you know every time i read lots of stuff i resonate
more than you can ever believe but i think the question is how to live an absurdity in a way
that um is nourishing and uh as a you know i'm a pathologist by training so so i mean you know
i'm a hard-nosed scientist so the question always is is you know we know we know what we know if you
like the complexity of of of these questions but what's the antidote
two things come come to mind of course sisyphus and and the and the absurd
but
the the the existential branch of thought comes a bit against the idea the rationality can
can read us of all the problems we have so that that's where the the subjective aspect comes from
and in a certain way there is no antidote at least not an antidote that can work for everyone
because meaning is a very personal experience so nobody can well you can try and impose meaning
on others you can try and say okay look this works for me try it but that doesn't assure you that
that it will work so it's a very very close relationship you have with with suicide the
absurd i don't think many people acknowledge the absurdity of all because it's a very difficult
thing to to digest it's it's very it leaves us very naked onto the world so that's where the
the subjective tools come in at least my faith goes towards the person goes to work towards
the individual so one question just because then i'll i'll chat up because i could talk for england
um nisha our lovely nisha who we love so much um the famous camel hypothesis
you know you know which i i pretty much love actually i use it every day i mean i suppose
my question is is the camel a desensitized absurdist and tony can i ask you to explain the camel for
people that don't well yeah sorry sorry i mean the camel is you know in in um nisha thought and
it's quite close to go to actually the the camel um you know he believed that four metamorphosis
of man was the camel first then the camel becomes a lion the lion slays the dragon and the dragon
becomes the child so he he basically said that uh and i know it's very interesting because use the
word all this huxley who i love um i mean and you use the word who i ended up was it all this
huxley or was it the the other guy who came up with the term the proletariat so let's use the
word the proletariat that nisha came up with the idea the proletariat were camels and that they
had desensitized themselves to this absurdity and then in came the lions that were trying to
transform who were absolutely naked to that absurdity tried to slay the slay the dragon
and then became the child so i mean you know there there is a question i have on a daily basis
in my own world of which so many people seem to be happy and absurdity that distresses me really
but i'll shut up on that one maybe otherwise i might talk for england well remember that the camel
needs to give way to the lion the lion then to the child uh we're talking about the spoke
saratustra which is a very good book uh very recommended possible yeah might might be difficult
but but it but but within it there are the all the concepts of nature and
in a certain way he nisha talks about the camel as as a metaphor for the animal that's
that's very very harsh and able to to support a lot of weight in fact that's the the idea
that the camel carries the weight of of the hump onto itself which gives him or if sorry
the the chance to survive the desert would give him the chance to to to live but then it needs to
change uh the the it was a very very accurate idea that the last metamorphosis of the child
because the child plays because the child creates and because the child is in a certain way
all potential so the idea of of getting rid of of god was not in in
talking about this idea of god is dead and we have killed him
and to be able to create and to create our own morality our own way of living makes us the
uberman makes us the ultra ultra man i don't know in english um yeah the uberman the uberman
it's it's um i would say that i i agree in a certain sense with with burton russel one of the
of the great um the philosophers of great britain uh he says i i think in an in an essay about
nature that we should we should always listen to him but be very careful to follow him because
the idea of the uberman doesn't consider the idea of others with us doesn't consider the idea that
we can build our own morality for ourselves because we we're never on us alone i i go to to
his total again the only ones who don't need others are the beasts or the gods all of us we need
we need the other and that's also the the the idea of saturday but why but why
i would love to go to a dinner party with all of you and talk about suicide
but what why why are we so different to the camel
we meaning cool this group who are here as a representative of existential
thinkers or behaviors or whatever
what makes you think we're we're so different from the camel well maybe we are firing things
the reason i'm i think is because i'm a biologist and i see that groups of societies
have such clusters of different if you like types who are there with a different job our
job is to agitate society really and that's well i'll i'll go i'll go back to the
do you remember the the the cave allegory of Plato yeah yeah the
do you remember why they chose to stay changed and and to see the shadows
no because because seeing the truth because facing all these things is extremely difficult
and not all of us are prepared and well one would say also with with the Huxley idea why would
someone anesthetize himself and we do it all the time we're not we're not exempt of the suffering
these entails so it's the very difficult thing and we try and be children in a certain way in
an ancient way but it's difficult and might be that at some point we are camels and some point
we're lions and some point we're children and some points we are we are just too tired to face all of
this so it's it's a strange way this idea of of facing all of this that's why well in many ways
religion is still very very disseminated across the world very helpful in many ways because it's
i would not say impossible but extremely hard to think of everything ourselves we need to rely on
the on to to to stand on the shoulders of giants umberto eco has a very good book about that
that's called on the shoulders of giants no i need to laugh because we need we we rely on on on the
ones that came before and that's why the idea would be they can still teach us a lot but we need to
look further and if we can't see further it's because they made the the much of the hard work
i don't know what the world would be without the Greeks i think i mean um i can't remember the
author but but he talked about the the battle of marathon as maybe the most important event on the
history of western civilization because if they the Athenians had lost that battle the world would
be a lot different and democracy would have would have let's say um died in its infancy so
yeah i i think i got i got carried away but um why people thank you for not to thank you for the
dialogue i'd love that no but but the but i i i'd say i find it much more interesting why would
someone face these things rather than than being as decides it's it's uh i think that question is
much more uh much more relevant why would someone choose to face all of this when they can just immerse
themselves in i don't know football politics or even religion that gives you the answers
there is a in psychoanalysis we we talk about uh sorry if the translation is not correct uh not
the fault um how would you say if when something is missing in you
um devoid devoid yeah it's not exactly void uh it's like the the castrate castrated when
and something is missing let's just call it the the missing
fanaticism and and Freud makes a very good case of this fanaticism compensates the missing
so you and and the missing might very well be the meaning in life and that's a missing that
cannot be undone cannot we cannot um we cannot uh successfully um equilibrate equilibrated
balance it so of course the the fanaticism supports in religion remember the thing of
uh of the void it might be the void i have to look for the translation i've never read
Freud in English which would be a very interesting experience and
the the fanaticism is the compensation of that we we we feel that void with with that
with our team with our church with our values and much of the artistic aspects of the of the
child goes towards that children find themselves playing with with let's say an empty box and
they have have a wonderful time but adults we say but it's just a box that doesn't matter
that the children create in in the void in the absence of and maybe that's where we at least
the ones that approach these ideas go towards we create where there is none we we make ourselves
answers where there is no answer at all and that's very difficult that's might be
very very harsh on on or heavy but in a certain way these places are wonderful for that
to say that we all are asking the same questions what can we do with that
hmm so and i don't know if it's i i don't have a very optimistic answers for this at least not in
the in the existential department um but but yeah um i hope it answers a little bit of the question
yeah thank you my friend welcome
can i ask you something where do you place the human encounter
in encounter meeting of two persons to the social encounter yeah yeah in in this
um in this difficult process of of trying to deal with existence or yeah
or the void or whatever or so yeah you say the child creates in the absence of things you know
so and maybe that's easier than than to create by means of the human relationship
that's that's why it's so difficult to relate maybe you know
maybe there's a truth in there or something i don't know so the topic of of human encounter
does it has a place in this yeah in this this existentialistic position uh yeah
i think the i think it was in the in the in the 80s or the 70s in tokyo there was um
a very big problem with suicides of young men so the government
consults with a group of psychologists and the psychologists suggest that
as the as the means of suicide was the train to jump onto the train that they put mirrors on
the other side of the of the train of the of the the place where the train of the rails
yeah the idea was that that would give the the men like a a shock of narcissism to say okay no
i look at myself and and i choose not to jump well that didn't work of course why
because the mirror is never the mirror literally the mirror we see ourselves by
other relationships we have at the others at the encounters
and the it was like a very literal way of understanding humankind
and so the encounter it's not only necessary is the thing that makes us who we are if if nobody
was there to receive you when you are a newborn you would die or even if if they give you the food
and the shelter you would still die because i think it's called white death
um the the that happened i think it was started in poland at the third in war where many of the
adults were killed and many babies were left at the care of very few people and they gave them
the shelter and the warmth and the and the food but they gave them no more attention than they
needed there was no let's say sorry for the word erotic eroticization of of the subjectivity
of the of the psychic apparatus so there wasn't like no will to live uh so yeah the the encounter
is is what makes us who we are that's why sartre says that the hell is others because they are
very capable of torturing ourselves but they are also capable of saving that's where he missed
just saw the the the negative aspect of the encounter and yeah existentialism is always about
people never uh in in solitude we we might suffer in solitude but dilemmas are shared
the problems are uh well very much uh faced together that's at least one of the the core
ideas of psychotherapy that another an encounter can help you face things that you could not face
before that's why they approach us or or anyone and that's a very powerful encounter at least
when you click when you have the for chemistry with your with your therapist it's a wonderful
experience so yeah the encounter is central it's like the antidote we found the antidote
it might might be for for tony i like that one
yeah well we need it we need it my friend we need it i begin to like tony you know
well we'll we'll be there together okay well that that's uh well that that came from an encounter
so yeah the the answer in action
and anna says in the chat all we need is love and a smiley face
well yeah
i don't know if he was so catchy all we need is meaning snub so
yeah not so so phonetically attractive if frankle was in the Beatles that was hitting
yeah
so uh it's um of course the the ideas would be uh would forth uh very very well in in in much more
time and much more uh uh deep analysis of of the the Greek culture and of the
Buddhism and the ideas they have and there is a lot of analysis we can make of of all of this
even the the bible has a lot of extension uh aspects to it it's after all well very very
inspired in in Greek ideas but that's the the the the the book that
the western civilization was built upon so of course it's in a certain way
filled with ideas we can connect not because of the of the truth of the idea i don't know if
i don't believe adam and eve are a literal and a literal story about how we come to be
but yes that it has a certain metaphors we must remember that we are symbolic creatures
the words we use are metaphors if i speak of a tree the word tree means nothing
if we have the meaning shed that's where the metaphor applies and and we understand each other
so through metaphors and through the stories as well as and i think that's the idea of the Greeks
they understood that that the metaphors on the on the myth and the philosophy could coexist
and in fact did in there but as as tony said well biology and science is so wonderful too
the problem is and i find it's a very very funny question for me that can science answer all the
questions it's a question that can't be answered but by science because science can't deal with
everything i think that's a tremendous question um but i mean one just one one with this thing
do you think that many humans are suppressed existentialists
what do you mean what what do you mean by suppressed
well conformity has has erased their questioning
well that's that's education for you formal education because i mean i i have a children's
book that i my grandchild had and i think that the modern children books are
moving away from metaphor to literal so it's a bit like you know oh i i agree and and it's
you wonder whether what's going to happen is that we're going to
suppress a lot of it in um in banality which i think is a very interesting word
hmm well i see it as well i i um in this couple of years of days i saw some news
that in the simpsons um the new episodes of the simpsons will not have a homer strangling
barred yeah because oh no you can't show this because the the children and i was like
that's that's uh an interesting take on that that that that we we lose the idea of that that's
a cartoon that's not that the people go struggling people because they see homer uh so it was like
that's like going towards the most literal of the of the readings you can make of that
and and in a certain way the most simplistic and superficial idea of that of course it's a
it's a funny example but i agree that we are losing metaphor we are losing the idea that words
are complex things they're not defined they're not um they're not written in stone
like saying okay god means peace well it depends on where you are and what context
and what place and and how you use the word so uh yeah i i agree with the diagnosis diagnosis that
we are we are becoming more literal or at least they they are trying to
they like who they are i think it's a lot based on ideology and a way of
thinking of people and our children specifically but it happens over there and happens here in
in argentina as well uh literality is quite uh i would say it's like they don't give the child
the chance to fall it's like everything everything is controlled and it's it's um no good that they
struggle because when you introduce something to a child well they can repeat the word but
they don't quite understand the concept the abstract idea yet uh it's a struggle they have to make
to to to keep incorporating things so the the idea of the literality is is very yeah i would
say it's poisonous enough as it is to not make people think very very deeply thinking has never
been easy has never been economically friendly in the in the in the in the sense of the of the
brain the brain itself it's quite lazy it tries it tries to deal with with everything even information
as as efficiently as possible so it's it is going against the current against the the the the the
waves but i think it's still a fight that's worth giving to try and think i don't think it's a very
good very good pathway not to think about things and not to connect with things because it's not
only that you lose the the the capacity to think abstractly of complex ideas but you also lose the
ability to connect with the emotions to go within so and and that's even more difficult to to counter
wait and because they they they chop off the the possibility of um well of connecting with
with the high emotions and powerful emotions but also with harsh emotions so uh that's part of life
the both extremes
i hope everyone leaves here with many questions
it's it's interesting because we came in thinking about ancient existential thinking and kind of
following it questioning its trajectory but this part of the conversation is quite disturbing to
think of where that future will go you know can we get to the point as if if existential ideas
started at the start of human civilization is the trajectory that we're following that
eventually we won't question are we are we questioning less deeply i mean it's it's kind
of mind-blowing to think that i think generally speaking the the like you've been saying the the
value in storytelling the value in myth the value in arts the value in performance all of this has
been replaced by other value systems that have just been you know really really shoved into the
the faces and the psyches of the population and uh you know it's it's not a comfortable
thought it's quite an oppressive thought to think where does that where does that go from here
but you you might want to think what what are we doing here today aren't we uh trying to to deal
with with some aspects of the of the human reality in a in a deep way and in a deep
and and yeah maybe disturbing idea that's why the the the dystopian authors are so
so interesting to me because they show a part of the of the reality which could come to be
i mean i i love the t-shirt that's saying of orwell that says i told you so
i think that's brilliant i i warned you guys not with with much anticipation and we we have a
constantly news about the state of of um double thought i i i saw in england those
interesting news that police goes to your to your place if you don't have the right idea if you
protest against something that's not should not be protested against so it's well that's orwellian
alright and and that's why thinking has always been problematic but uh at least
in a in a in a community way this is a very powerful thing but also in the in the
in the psychotherapy department is okay think about uh about yourself and who you are
who you want to be who you can be uh so yeah i i don't find that that it's more disturbing
now than it was before we we've seen atrocities uh all over the the history of humankind
and maybe the the shock comes with the idea that life should be easy peaceful and and with a
with a soft music behind you know life is and and the events of the world have shown that
life is difficult and life is many times unexpected but we need to fight for the
the ideas we stand for and for the things that makes us who we are so yeah
of course it's disturbing but it's only disturbing if you look at it
the thing is it's difficult to look and to understand what what we see that's why people
um who was it Pascal
that says something like this like it's easier or i don't know it's easier for
for people to to trust what they see in their eyes instead of thinking about it
because one is seeing beyond what you see maybe a little bit connected with the
literality we talked before so it's always been difficult but it's a fight that
at least gives meaning at least to me to to keep on with the with the ideas
uh that um that these things deserve the the time and deserve our energy
and i think in one way kind of thinking what Tony was saying at the beginning it there's
something you know unified there's something almost courageous to be spending your life
specifically dedicated to exploring these ideas and you were speaking about this kind of this group
of existentialists collecting together today whether that's live or you know in the in the future
viewers but it another side of that argument is everyone to to an extent everybody is
questioning these ideas in their own way and actually finding a community like we have
created and are creating there is um there's something a lot easier to be able to to
question in this collective community and have the resources that we do and i think
you know everybody's thinking but where it's almost easier we're almost fortunate to have
to be thinking about it in this community rather than just flailing around you know
um isolatedly and a lot of my clients come to me because they have been questioning these
questions alone and it's incredibly scary and painful whether that's finding a community within
an existential philosophy and having those resources or whether that's in music and collaborating in
that way or arts in that way but i remember Natalie there was um one of your interview that
lovely thing you did was it last year when you interviewed all these people and there was a guy
who said um you know that he would go to a dinner party and never leave not leave if we
were talking about this subject i can't remember the name of the guy but it but it's very it's
almost irony isn't it that we would um we as a group would love a dinner party around this we
would drink all night you wouldn't we wouldn't leave whereas most parties i go to i want to be
there under 30 seconds and i'm on to delete so isn't it ironic
the remember that not not everyone is ready for those questions but once you start it's very
difficult to believe that once you start is almost like there is a point of no return
yeah i love that i love that what what is your drive to continue questioning
my drive
at some point why do you why do you look at the disturbing
why do i look at that but it's disturbing at the disturbing i mean looking at things
things are disturbing only when you look at it and you said
yeah so what's your drive to open yourself to the disturbing
i remember there was a writer that was asked why does he write and he answered because i cannot
not do it and and i think once you go towards these questions you can't stop you can't i mean
it's very difficult to to uh very difficult or even impossible without any uh huge defense
mechanisms that might be crippling defense mechanisms to see something to to not see
something that you saw so um i i can't i cannot stop looking at things but that doesn't mean that
that i can't appreciate the the wonderful things that are down here look at the the space we have
we have today it's a wonderful thing to be able to communicate from two sides of the world
and to talk about these things of course they are difficult of course they are uncomfortable
but the the alternative is much worse at least for me that's why it's a choice and it's a difficult
choice and it's a choice that might not be for all remember that these things are and and the
struggles we have are the same the same as the ones that the greeks had the the the cave the
allegory of the cave is exactly that many will choose to remain in the cave and there is nothing
we can do for them because they they they have to choose and that's the freedom that's the the
exercise of freedom they have even if it's not for the for the their their benefit
that's of course we can we can lament we can we can
we can suffer the idea of them of everyone not seeing something we can't impose that thing on
them that's why at least in psychotherapy it's no use if someone says oh no you should go to therapy
and and and i'll take you because there is not something personal that the person chooses to work
there i remember in in the public hospital and we had a specific team that dedicated themselves to
to to traffic yeah so so the people that that came to to renew their licenses need to make a
a psychic test and and have a certain space uh and i would say no i i don't want them because
they are not patients they don't choose to be there they are forced by the third because
circumstance is of their work and in fact that's the the case they didn't work in therapy they they
just it was just a part of the of the functionality of the the demands that the the the the government
made that's why it's first the desire desire to go there desire to work that's a very good first step
to therapy
i've got my eye on the time and uh just like you say it's once you start it's very difficult to
stop i think we've all proved the case that it's very difficult to stop this and even when we close
today today's session we'll all be thinking because we really can't stop um but in terms of actual
time we we definitely have to bring it to a close unfortunately but i want to thank absolutely
everybody thank you so much for for taking the time to come and thank you for everyone that
contributed either just by your presence or just in the chat or or part of the conversation to make
this event what it is it's so nice to have a community i think that's what comes for me today
one of the many things it's so amazing to have this community to explore these questions and um
it wouldn't exist without everybody that makes it so so thank you so much and of course a huge
thank you to marcos um from all the way from marge and tina it feels funny all the way but
we've all the way but thank you so much um thank you so much thanks thanks everyone for being here
thank you hope hope you you live with many questions and of course thanks to natalie for
for the space and and to keep on making these these sorts of things that are very helpful
so thank you all thank you natalie ciao ciao okay bye ciao bye
you
