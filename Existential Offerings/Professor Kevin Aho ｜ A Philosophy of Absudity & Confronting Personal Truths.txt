So, welcome, Kevin. Thank you so, so much for coming along today. What an amazing way
to start the week. I really appreciate your time here. So, for those who are not familiar
with yourself or with your work, how would you introduce yourself?
Well, I am Kevin Aho. I'm a professor of philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University. I've been
here in Florida since 2004 at this university. And I'm also the chair of the Department of
Communication and Philosophy at the university right now. I did, I had kind of a convoluted
journey through graduate school. I started out at the new school for social research
in New York City and then moved to University of Utah and Salt Lake City and then finished
up my PhD at the University of South Florida in Tampa where I studied with a very important
figure in existential philosophy and especially Heidegger, a fellow named Charles Guillaume
who sadly passed away this past summer but had a long and influential career and taught
a lot of students. And so that's the brief condensed version of who I am. And I consider
myself a specialist in existential philosophy, phenomenology of the body and areas of existential
psychotherapy and phenomenological psychotherapy.
Now phenomenology of the body is not something that I come across people saying a lot as their
specialities.
Yeah, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a booming field right now. It's largely indebted to
the renewed interest in the work of Maurice Metalponte and some important and seminal
feminist figures, obviously Simone de Beauvoir, one and Iris Marion Young, another figure.
And it's simply a recognition that the body is not something we have and that we're only
contingently connected to. It's who we are. We are our bodies. We exist through our bodies.
We live through the vehicle of our bodies. And so it's an attempt to undermine that classic
Cartesian dualism that the human being is composed of two distinct substances and an
immaterial mind and a causally determined body. And phenomenology undoes that dualism
in helpful ways.
So you spoke slightly about your, your kind of academic journey into this amazing field
of philosophy and existentialism. But what drew you to want to specialize in existentialism
in the first place? How did you stumble upon this, this particular?
Yeah, it's a good question. I came from a family of intellectuals. My father was a professor
of sociology, but mostly kind of German social theory and was raised, came of age during
the counterculture revolution in the sixties and early seventies, when existentialism was
all the rage and everyone was carrying around tattered copies of Camus and Sartre and Beauvoir.
And my parents met in graduate school. And so I was surrounded by books growing up. And
I, in my second semester of college, I was actually an engineering major in college,
believe it or not. And the second semester of college, I read Dostoevsky's The Brothers
Karamazov during the winter break. And the book had a transformative impact on me. And
it raised all of these deep existential questions about the meaning of life, the existence of
God, the problems of nihilism, the experiences of anxiety and the face of death. And it awakened
me to the fact that I've had these experiences. I feel this in my everyday life. And I changed
my major to philosophy and never looked back. And many other aspects of philosophy I find
uninteresting and boring, metaphysics and epistemology, even much of ethics, moral philosophy
I find boring and turgid. But existentialism always inspired me and shaped me. And it has
stayed with me since I was 18 or 19 years old. And I had powerful experiences in my early
adulthood and late adolescence of hanging out with my high school friends, you know,
getting high and having a few beers under the stars and talking about the meaning of
life. And what is it all about? And who are we? And why are we here? And I realized that
those were the questions of the existentialists. Those are deep and important existential questions.
And unfortunately, as we move into adulthood and find our way into careers and family life,
we oftentimes lose touch with those important questions. And we kind of drift along in our
existence until there's a crisis or a breakdown. And suddenly we wake up again to how important
existential thinking is. And so that has kind of been the arc of my life. It's always been shaped
and informed by an existential attitude or an existential orientation.
It sounds like you genuinely connected with the kind of existential questions and never were
able to kind of shake them away rather than stumbling across a textbook in a formalized
module and saying, okay, I better learn this theory. You've felt the questions within you.
That was a visceral experience. It wasn't about a vocation. It wasn't about even getting a job
as a philosophy professor. It was about a way of existing. And so I would be doing existentialism
if I was managing a restaurant or working in middle management somewhere for a company,
I would still be watching existential films, listening to existential music, reading existential
poetry, and all of the things that move me, as you say, viscerally or in a mooted way.
Because they speak to the concerns at the core of our condition. These are the ultimate
concerns of our lives. And so, yeah, they've had a powerful orienting impact on me.
You bring up something for me, which is the fact that you're going through that phase of life
when you're younger and you're chatting with your friends, and you're asking these massive,
massive questions, these really deep questions. And then you fade into a life where you're not
supposed to be asking these questions. I remember for me, I don't know about you, but it was
kind of almost stigmatized to ask why rather than to just follow, to question these deep
meanings rather than to just pick a career and follow it. I don't know if you can relate to that.
Oh, certainly I can. And it's, you know, just because we are kind of sucked into
the shallows of social convention and go with the flow of everyday life, the existentialists
make it clear that that's not a moral failing. It's not as if you're doing something wrong.
It's just part of the inertia of being human, that we're always going to be,
Heidegger has this language of temptation, we're tempted by the they or the public world,
because it's comfortable, it's predictable, it's, it's well ordered, and it covers over
the anxiety that kind of quivering unease, that all human beings experience,
an unease that reminds us that there's something wrong with us, that there's something disconnected
or out of sync with us and the world. And it's because we're conscious, it's because we're
self aware that we're aware that we're going to die, we're aware that God is dead and there are
no moral absolutes. And so I think existentialists are just deeply attuned to the fragility and
weakness of human beings, that we drift to religion, we drift to comfort, we drift to
social norms because it, it shelters us and it protects us. It's not a bad thing, it's just,
it's, it's, it's structural to the human condition. But thankfully in life, we have breakdown
experiences where that comfortable facade collapses and we're forced to confront ourselves
and face who we are. And that's why anxiety conditions, whether you call it anxiety, if
you're Kierkegaard or Nazia, if you're Sard or absurdity, if you're Camus, or, or the horror of
the nothing, if you're Nietzsche, all of these experiences are edifying experiences because
they jolt us out of our routinized drift and force us to face ourselves and to face our existence.
And so the existentialists do something counterintuitive and that is they tell us that anxiety
is a good thing, it's a teacher. It's not something that should be medicated necessarily,
it's not something that should be controlled with cognitive behavioral therapy necessarily.
That's not to say that those things shouldn't be included in a, in a treatment plan. But we
should listen and attend to those experiences because they're teaching us valuable lessons
about who we are. Because I always have heard that existentialism gets a bad rep for being
too focused on the negative, too focused on the dark. But I, similarly to what you've just said,
have never experienced like that. There's always been a sensation that it acknowledges and explores
the darker side that is inevitably going to be there, whether you're facing it or not.
And actually, if you're able to explore these different philosophies, these different
perspectives on the dark and really confront and really explore what that means for you,
you are empowering yourself in a way that nothing, no denial or no putting it to the side will ever,
ever do. And that's one of the recurring misconceptions about existentialism that's a dark,
brooding, naval gazing philosophy. It's, it's not at all. The idea is when you confront death and
face death, you, you awaken to the fact that life is not a dress rehearsal, that this is the only
life you have. And, and confronting finitude, facing anxiety, injects a measure of intensity
and urgency and vitality into our existence that otherwise it wouldn't have. And this is why
Nietzsche calls his philosophy a gay science. It's a happy philosophy. It's not a morbid philosophy.
It's, it's a joyful philosophy. And Kierkegaard will say the same thing, right? That, that when you
confront death, it, it, it opens us up to how precious and poignant and fragile every moment is
because it can be snatched away from us at any time. And so in, in many ways, existentialism,
at least for me, is the most life affirming of all philosophies. It's not a death-focused philosophy
at all. It's, it's, it's reminding us of how precious each moment is and that we can't take
any day for granted. Now I jumped straight into existential philosophies and I am not as familiar
with other philosophies. So how would you distinguish between what differentiates existential
philosophies from other philosophies? Well, I mean, just in terms of academic specialties,
in Anglo-American philosophy, existentialism is completely marginalized because it doesn't
focus on the core issues of truth and knowledge and the nature of reality and, and what is the
best, what is good conduct, what ought we to do. Existentialism doesn't care about any of that
generally because the concern is not on philosophical abstractions. What is the nature of beauty,
truth, justice, the good life? No, actually, that's not true. They're concerned with the good life.
The existentialist is concerned with what does it mean to be human? What is existence? And so
what the existentialists do is they shift the philosophical orientation away from theoretical
detachment where we theorize about abstract forms and turn our attention to the concrete flesh and
blood particulars of everyday life, which is what existence engages or is involved in. And so
it's a complete, it's a complete reversal of the traditional philosophical orientation
that we inherit from Plato and Aristotle and that, that gets refined and consolidated with
figures like Descartes and Kant. It's not a, it's not a philosophy rooted in theoretical reflection.
It's a philosophy rooted in attentiveness to the concreteness of our existence, of our being.
And that means it focuses on the way we live every day, the moods we feel, the affective
experiences that shape us and, and shock us into awareness like those anxiety moods or nausea moods.
And so it's always been a kind of peripheral fringe philosophy in the UK and the United States,
obviously less so in the Golden Age of French philosophy and German philosophy in the 20s
and 30s and teens. But thankfully that's starting to change. And one of the drivers of this change
is a recognition that because existentialism focuses on concrete existence, it can expand the
philosophical perspective to include voices that have been traditionally marginalized in the
philosophical mainstream. So feminist philosophy, of course, was, was in many ways inaugurated by
Simone de Beauvoir. A critical race theory had a, was deeply impacted by Frans Fanon, who was a
student of Sarts and, and, and Beauvoir's and was influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponti. And so these,
these other forms of philosophical approach that have never had a voice at the table are finally
being seen as bona fide philosophical perspectives that in my view are in many ways indebted to
existentialism by focusing on the concrete and the particular instead of abstract universal forms or
essences. I know this is me speaking from a completely biased perspective, but I, hearing
you say that it makes me find it hard to imagine why other philosophies have the ability to matter
if we haven't understood who it, what it is to be ourselves. We haven't understood the kind of
existential aspect of existence. Why does any, why, why does it matter what's right or wrong if we
don't know what we are? I totally agree. I mean, I find most of Anglophone philosophy quite boring
and uninteresting because of that. And as a teacher, the classes that excite the students and
engage the students and inspire the students are existentially themed courses because they're at
that stage in life where they're asking those questions, what am I doing? What is it about?
Why am I, why am I majoring in this and not in that? And how is this going to shape the future of
my life? And so when we start talking about Friedrich Nietzsche or Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul
Saag, the students resonate to these questions because they're feeling them right now at age 18,
19, 20, 21. And they're going to have to confront those really serious concerns. They're not, they're
not so passionate about abstract metaphysical speculation. Those are interesting and curious
thought puzzles. But they're curious in the same way that I'm curious about getting good at chess
or, or, or figuring out the New York Times crossword puzzle. Those thought experiments or
philosophical curiosities don't keep me up at night. They don't wake me up at 3am where I'm
jolted awake and I think, what's the meaning of my life? That's existentialism. That's more important.
Yeah, there's a difference between intellectual fascination, intellectual curiosity and kind
of an inherent questioning that you're saying kind of innately surfaces at certain time times of life
you're saying and in certain experiences, for example, this really life-shattering or life
questioning experiences. Yeah, exactly. And we have been obviously discussing the phenomenon,
but we have not been defining the phenomenon. If that is possible, how would you define it?
Well, existentialism as a technical term is almost beyond a clear definition. And it's an
ism, as I, as I write in my book, that really is misleading. It's not like rationalism or
empiricism or, or scientism or naturalism. It doesn't refer to a unified philosophical school.
And the word wasn't introduced until, until the 1940s, right, by Gabriel Marcell and
Marcell used that word to refer to the philosophies of Sartre and Beauvoir. But, you know, existentialism
as a word didn't exist in the 19th century. So Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,
the word didn't even exist. But I think to get a sense of the overall contours of what the word
refers to, it, it, it, it refers to a philosophical focus on what it means to be human. What does it
mean for a human being to exist? And the idea is that we exist in a way that's fundamentally
different from the way this water bottle exists, or this cell phone exists. We are not substances.
We're not static things that are objectively present to be studied. We are activities or
processes or happenings. So existence is an event for humans. It's a, it's an event of
self-making or self-fashioning. We make ourselves who we are through the meaning-giving choices
that we undertake as our lives unfold. And this is what Sartre means when he says existence
precedes essence, right? There is no pre-given essence that determines who we are. We make
ourselves who we are by choices, by actions. And those actions are always constrained by our
embodiment, our social historical situation, our gendered or sexual situation. So, so it's not as if
our self-created, our, our, the activity of self-creation is completely unhinged. It's not
completely undetermined. It's situated and constrained by what the existentialists call
facticity, the facticity of who we are. And so what we do as humans is we are in a struggle or
a tension between the givens of our situation and our capacity to interpret and give meaning
to those givens. And the existentialists call that transcendence. So we're always in this
tension between transcendence and facticity. And that struggle is existence itself, right? I'm,
I'm giving meaning to the fact that I'm a man in the 21st century who's white and middle class and
for the time being ambulatory and able-bodied. And I'm going to have to interpret and give
meaning to that factical determination as it changes and shifts and, and is modified throughout
the course of my life. And of course, what that means is that the process of self-making
is finite. It's temporal. It comes to an end. In other words, we make ourselves who we are
with the recognition that that process of self-making is finite, that we are beings on
the way towards death. And we don't like that. That scares us. So oftentimes we live in a way
that is in denial or flight from our own finitude, from our own mortality. And that's why most of our
lives are inauthentic or in the words of Sartre and Beauvoir, in bad faith, we live in a state of
self-deception most of our lives. And we think in the course of our lives that there's something
real and enduring and lasting about our existence. But the existentialists want to remind us that
there is nothing real, enduring or lasting about our existence. Our existence is finite.
And that's not a bad thing. It's just, it's just part of what it means to be human. And we need to
kind of own up to that. And so central to that process of authentic self-creation is a kind of
honesty, that we need to be honest with ourselves and cut away all of the layers of self-deception
that we carry with ourselves to protect us from the horror of our finitude, the horror of our
contingency. So one of the things that the existentialists say is that, you know, we exist,
but we don't have to exist. There's no reason for us to exist. We just happen to be thrown into
existence. And against the backdrop of our thrownness, we now have to make ourselves into who we are.
And that's a huge burden. That's the burden of freedom. It's dizzying and anxiety-provoking.
And we don't like to accept that either. And that's why we like to be told what to do.
We like our priests to tell us what to do, our therapists to tell us what to do, our
pop psychologists to tell us how to live our lives. We don't want to do it on our own.
And of course, what the existentialists want to say is, you're always on your own anyway.
You've got to be honest with yourself. So that's the cliff-notes version of existentialism.
Hard to define, but there are kind of central features built into it. Freedom, authenticity,
temporality, all of these things kind of undergird all of the existentialist philosophers.
The problem, unfortunately, is that some of the most significant voices in existentialism
aren't philosophers at all. They're novelists like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. They're poets like
Reiner Maria Rilke. They're filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa. They're playwrights like Sartre
and novelists like Beauvoir. And so existentialism expands far beyond the academic world.
It's not exclusive to philosophers. It's open to anyone who's sincerely concerned
about the human condition and is anxious about what it means to be human and is trying to
articulate and express that anxiety or that concern. And there are also religious existentialists
and atheistic existentialists. And so not all existentialists are following Nietzsche's maxim
that God is dead. Many of the most important existentialists were theistic existentialists
like Dostoevsky, like Carl Tillich, like Martin Buber. And there are some existentialists that
don't believe in free will like Nietzsche. He thinks free will is a fiction. It's an illusion.
But most existentialists have some conception of freedom, of free will. And so this is why it's
so difficult to demarcate the boundaries of what existentialism is.
Yet there are these familiar names that are going to generally be coming across when you're
studying it, especially from an academic point of view. And it's making me think, what, you know,
who, how, how did these particular names get selected and put into the textbooks? And why are
they the ones kind of being regurgitated and shared, not that there's anything not completely
marvelous about what they're sharing and that they shouldn't be shared? But why them? Why not
anyone else? Because they're the ones that do it. They're the ones that engage the human condition
in the most powerful and accessible and visceral way. And so other novelists may talk about the
human condition in certain ways, but very few do it the way Dostoevsky does it, in crime and
punishment or in the Brothers Karamazah. Very few articulate the experience of confronting death
like Tolstoy does and the death of Yvonne Iliac. Very few capture the despair in the face of the
dizzying abyss of existence like Soren Kierkegaard does and sickness unto death. So these are the
figures that engage the human condition in the most powerful way. But there are other marginal
figures or figures on the periphery that do it in different ways. But in my view, they may not do it
as well. And or some may not have been discovered yet, who knows. But when it comes to the major
figures, they're major for a reason, because their legacy is enduring and lasting because
they tend to do it better than anyone else. And it being they speak to that humanness within you,
to that unspeakable part of you, which is just craving stimulation, craving questions,
craving answers, and they allow this kind of internal communication with that being. And
that's why they're well, it's it's, I mean, I don't know if it's craving stimulation or craving
answers. I mean, one of the things that the existentialist will say is that craving for
stimulation is actually a form of denial. We want to be stimulated and distracted
from our human condition. And there are no answers to the human condition. What the existentialist
want to do is put us in a state of questionability, that there is no answer to the question what it
means to be human. You have to find that for yourself. You have to give your life meaning.
So there are no, it is not as if the existentialist lays out a guidebook to being who you are.
That's the scary part about existentialism. It's up to you to find out what this means.
This is why Nietzsche, for instance, is so famous for cautioning his readers. Don't become
Nietzscheans. Don't follow me. Follow yourself. You need to you need to carve out your existence
and give meaning to your existence in the way that matters to you. Nietzsche did it for himself,
but you're not Nietzsche. You have to do it in your own way. Kierkegaard calls this subjective
truth. It's a truth that no one else has access to. It's your truth that belongs to you. And
it's going to be inco-parent and unintelligible to anyone else. And that's why it's precious to
who you are. So one of the tricky things about existentialism is a philosophy, and actually
this is kind of true to philosophy in general. Answers aren't part of the project. The project
is to immerse yourself in the questions, or as Rilke says, live the questions, exist the questions,
and be comfortable in the mystery and the ambiguity of the human condition. The more we try to find
reasons or grounds for our existence, the further away from authenticity we drift. Does that make
sense? And that is my observation of what is causing people the deepest pain, is when they are
needing that answer to what ultimately can't be answered, because it is just life. It is just your
decision. You wake up each day and either do the very much similar thing that you did yesterday,
or you be a completely different version of yourself doing a completely different thing,
there is just infinite ambiguity if you're willing to experience it.
Yeah, and so I think one of the measures of authenticity or being true to ourselves
is to learn how to be comfortable with or to dwell in uncertainty, to dwell in mystery and
ambiguity, and don't recoil from it or don't try to control it and master it, but to immerse
yourself in it. And that is the human condition. It is a fundamentally ambiguous and uncertain
predicament. And the more we try to control it and manipulate it and master it, the more anxious
we become. And this is one of the key features of it in existential psychotherapy. The more you
try to control your anxiety, the more your anxiety takes control of you. The more you befriend your
anxiety and welcome your anxiety and dwell in it, the less control it has over you, the less
power it has over you. For someone that might be watching this and really sitting there struggling
with their mental well-being or with their experience of life, and they were hoping that
existential ideas might alleviate some of that, what would you recommend for them in terms of
either just exploration or particular sources? Well, it's hard for me to say because I'm not a
clinician and I'm not a mental health counselor. And I think it's a case-by-case situation. I think
one of the stereotypes of existentialism is that it's anti-psychiatry. And this is an orientation
that was really pioneered by figures like Artie Lang, who was deeply inspired by existentialism,
especially the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. And the idea is that any medical intervention that
blunts or covers over our freedom or our confrontation with our condition is dehumanizing
and problematic. I don't think that's true at all. I think some people need pharmaceutical
assistance, medication. I think some people need instrumental psychotherapies like cognitive and
behavioral therapy. And so my approach to this from a mental health perspective is very much an
eclectic approach. You use what works. I think someone in the grips of full-blown panic and
anxiety, Nietzsche is not going to help that person. Kierkegaard's not going to help that person.
In fact, it could inflame the situation and amplify it. However, if the anxiety is controlled or
mediated in some sense with an antidepressant or with some form of cognitive and behavioral therapy,
that may allow that suffer to begin the hard work of existential psychotherapy. And so I would
certainly not employ existential psychotherapy as a first line of treatment in every situation
by any means. But I think existential psychotherapy has to be employed for lasting
change, to occur for lasting and significant transformation to happen and growth to happen.
And so yeah, I think that's kind of the way I would go about it.
Which could almost be summarized as saying work out on a kind of on an individual basis,
on a unique basis. And also I would argue in unique to each moment, because so I do work
as a practitioner and I'm obviously highly influenced by existential philosophies in my
work. But what I'm going to do with a client one day or how we will be together in a session
one day is going to be fundamentally different perhaps than the previous week or the next week.
And I feel that from my perspective, at least, there's something about having these philosophical
ideas, having these concepts, having these key themes, almost within myself as lenses or perspectives
to have as an alternative way to look, and especially a lot of it's rooted in not being able
to change, not being able to make a change. I think that's right. And I think one of the great
insights of existentialism is the recognition that anxiety and despair
are not medical conditions. They shouldn't be medicalized as discrete medical entities.
They are structural to the human condition. They're inescapable. Everyone is going to have
powerful and life shattering anxiety moments. And most of us will have them over and over again
throughout our lives as we get to go through a divorce or our parents die or we lose our job
or we suffer a serious illness. All of those experiences are going to shatter us.
And we're going to have to confront ourselves. But to say that that experience of existential
shattering or anxiety in the face of our own finitude is a medical condition is really problematic
in my view, because that doesn't mean they shouldn't be treated and assisted with pharmaceuticals
or CBT or something like this. What the existentialists want to remind us is that these are instructive,
edifying opportunities for personal growth and transformation. They're awakenings. And
if we just blunt these awakenings with tranquilizers or are trained to not attend to them and avoid
them, you're never going to have those transformative opportunities that anxiety can bring to us.
Do you feel that there have been moments in your own life when this has applied?
Oh, God. Countless times in my life, every major breakdown, every crisis existentialism has helped
me. Three years ago, I had a massive heart attack while on a 60 mile bike ride, something I did
regularly. I was kind of a fitness advocate and health nut. And I had a massive heart attack.
And my whole world collapsed. My identity as a professor, my identity as a physically fit
middle-aged man, my identity as a partner in terms of my relationships. And existentialism
helped me work through that trauma and come through the other side, I think, as a better
human being with a deeper perspective about life's frailty and precariousness. And woke me up to
living with a sense of urgency and vitality and intensity that you inevitably get sucked away
from in the drift of professional life or family obligations and work obligations and so on. So
existentialism has, throughout my life, from 18 years old on, numerous breakdowns,
divorce, sicknesses, losses of friends to cancer and illness has pulled me through
and deepened my life and opened up opportunities for growth and transformation.
And so it has been, whether it's through existential literature or reading Heidegger again
or teaching Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sard in the classroom, it's always been therapeutic for me.
I appreciate you sharing. And I suppose because I'm socialized to think it, I'm almost instinctively
when you hear someone's experience of trauma, you want to instinctively say, I'm so sorry that you
had that experience. But I'm learning more and more, and especially with you sharing this brilliant,
this growth beyond, and these new insights that you gain from it, there's almost a sense that,
well, I'm not sorry that you had that experience in a way you're saying that it contributed beautifully
to your life. And that's actually the great gift of existential philosophy is that these
traumas and crises, I mean, you don't want to romanticize them. You don't want to romanticize
suffering. And that's always a temptation in existential philosophy that he or she who suffers
the most is the deepest and the most authentic. That's just nonsense. And I don't think that's
a right, an accurate depiction of what the existentialists are trying to do. But the
recognition that trauma and suffering and breakdowns awaken us to life's frailty and its poignancy
and remind us not to take our relationships for granted or our day for granted, that it could
be snuffed out at any time, our tremendously valuable life lessons. And they improve and
enhance our lives. They don't diminish it at all. They make us, in my view, better people,
more compassionate, more understanding, more sympathetic to the suffering of others.
And so I think you're right, that cliche, I'm so sorry this happened. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Those losses are opportunities for growth. Those deaths are opportunities for transformation.
And Kierkegaard is great with this. I mean, Kierkegaard goes so far as to say,
God wants you to die. God wants you to die to the world. Because when you die to the world,
the world comes back to you in a way that's more vibrant and intense and urgent than it was before.
So the idea is to die over and over throughout your life. And every time you die, the world comes
back with more vibrancy, intensity, and poignancy. And during that process, you prepare for your actual
death. In Rilke's words, you learn how to die, which is the most important lesson that a philosopher
can teach. How can you learn how to die? I'm aware that it could be really easy for someone to
for someone to sit here and hear this and think, well, it's so easy for you guys to speak theoretically
about embracing the opportunities that suffering provides. But hey, I'm sitting here
with a real life experience of suffering, and I have no idea how to. How do we do that,
especially when we haven't had, you know, the advantage of years of actual philosophical
engagement? Yeah, it's a very difficult question. I mean, some people won't. Most people won't.
Most people will live lives of deep suffering and meaninglessness. And that's just the part
of the predicament of being human. Many people live sad, ordinary lives that are bereft of deep
meaning and significance. Tolstoy says it great in the in the death of Yvonne Iliac. He says,
Yvonne Iliac lived an ordinary, simple life, and therefore it was a life that was most terrible.
And that's the life that most of us will live. And this is why I think Natalie projects like the
ones that you're doing, which are trying to give voice to this, the importance of existentialism
are so important. Education is important. Good liberal arts humanities education is important.
Reading great literature, watching good film, listening to good music. Those are all important
edifying experiences that speak to the human condition. Insofar as those those movies and
pieces of literature and pieces of music speak to the human condition. And so
again, you know, sadly, most of us are going to suffer and not have the wisdom that the existential
tradition can open and open us up to. And one of the things that I do in my work is I try to
popularize existentialism by writing about it and by giving talks on it and by giving
going to conferences and being a Piper to my students about how important these questions
and ideas are. And so I try to incorporate that wisdom into everything that I do in my conversations
with my friends, with my partner, with my colleagues, reminding them that this petty
squabble about academic bureaucracy doesn't really matter. Don't get hung up on it because
you're going to die and you're going to die at any time. And so put yourself, put things in
perspective. What really matters in the grand scheme of things. And Irvin Yalom, the great
existential psychotherapist, refers to this as trivializing the trivial. Realize that these
things that we worry about most of the time in our lives are trivial, stupid,
waste of time, that there are much bigger, more significant issues on the table, like living
a meaningful life and being a decent human being. And how generally does that go down for you when
you're engaging with people who are living in the trivial, who are embracing the trivial
conversations and you're like, hold up, you know, that is trivial. Let's talk about something.
It's a really good question. I mean, you have to be careful because it's not going to register for
most people. I mean, most people like Kevin, he's so dramatic. I mean, he's such an intellectual,
he's always talking about these heavy things. But if you're sensitive and mindful to the
speaking position of other people, you can do it in ways that are thoughtful and sensitive.
And so you don't want to bludgeon someone with existential philosophy and say, wake up, wake
up. You can be thoughtful by asking questions like, what does that mean for you? Why is this
worrying you? Why is this concerning to you? With my students, it's a little bit different.
I can be a little bit more blunt because I'm a teacher and they're learning this material. So
I can shove it down their throats, whether they like it or not. But with my friends and my family
and my colleagues, you have to be a little bit more indirect and thoughtful and recognize that
these ideas are quite scary and can be terrifying if you've never dipped your toe into existential
philosophy before and that most of our culture is built in such a way as to deny these concerns.
Most of our cultural institutions are set up in a way that we don't have to face the existential
givens. We don't have to face death. We don't have to face absurdity. We don't have to confront
anxiety. And so you want to be cautious in terms of how you bring this up. But oftentimes it means
that I just cut some people out of my life if they're not willing to engage. So I don't have
a lot of friends maybe for that reason. But it's the same reason why I don't have friends who are
Donald Trump supporters. I just there's no reason for me to waste my time with someone
who is a dogmatic follower of Donald Trump. I have nothing really to say to that.
In the same way that it'd be very hard for me to try to gently broach the idea that maybe God is
an invention to someone who is deeply ensconced in a religious faith and their identity hinges on
the idea that God has to exist. It'd be very hard for me to disentangle that person from those
deeply held convictions. I could suggest some literature maybe some books but it wouldn't
be a conversation that I'd be interested in having. I remember really early on in my training
one of the lecturers must have just supervised some students because it was obviously quite
fresh for her but she was saying that they'd conducted their entire thesis on the potentially
damaging and ending results that engaging in existential philosophy can have on
interrelationships be that with partners intimate relationships with friends with family members
because it you know we speak about you spoke there about choosing to move away but it almost
becomes and I've spoken with colleagues it almost becomes intolerable not to think deeply not
to see things as trivial when they are trivial. I agree and I think and I don't want to be harsh
about this but it's okay to cut people out of your life that have no that aren't that aren't
bringing meaning and value to your existence and with family members it's much more difficult
because there are our long-standing connections of intimacy but I I don't have much problem
disconnecting from friends that don't really see the relevance of these kinds of questions
or concerns and I also have a very hard time with small talk and gossip it makes me very
uncomfortable so so going to cocktail parties or where people are just talking about trivial things
that makes me quite anxious and unnerved and and I don't like that but if a conversation at
a party is involving real serious existential questions I'll be there all night and and I'll
be passionate about the conversation and so so it's for me it's a temperamental orientation
temperamentally I I I'm very uncomfortable with with with surface conversation it makes me
it makes me quite anxious and it's the same thing at faculty meetings or department meetings I'm a
department chair so I have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and deal with upper administration
those meetings I can't stand I have a very difficult time sitting through them because I see the the
vast waste of time that these meetings suck up in a life and I think okay there's another two hours
of my life that I'll never get back that that didn't contribute anything to my to my sense of who I am
and so I think some people maybe you're like this Natalie that that temperamentally you're just drawn
to these ideas it's not something that you can really help it's just it's it's it's it's part of
your your constitution and I can confidently say that you have just validated so many of my peers
experiences there too when you say you struggle with small talk and and gossip and and I had
wondered if that's just because everyone's just coming to the end of this huge huge
doctorate journey which is exhausting and overwhelming in itself but perhaps it is
part of this it might be part of a deeper uh uh existential orientation and you know
again if if if a group of friends are sitting around talking about really important life issues
I'm drawn to that like a laser beam and and I will listen and nod my head and contribute where I can
but if the conversation is about politics or sports or redecorating a house or installing a
backyard gazebo I or what restaurant is good or or who's coming to town in terms of a band or
something I could care less I just my eyes glaze over I mean I can play the game and put on the
mask of sociability as good as anyone but um uh when I go home I'll feel uh deflated and upset
that I lost a few more hours of my life and you see and I'm not sure if you noticed it but I
want to reflect back that you said it's those conversations and those meetings which don't
contribute to who I am and that is what is antagonizing and frustrating about them yeah
and that's not to say that I don't willfully do it and I know it's important work to keep a
university going and I know that we have to put on masks to keep the machinery of society
lubricated and well oiled um and and it's also not a judgmental thing I'm not I may come off
like I'm being judgmental it's it's it's it's who I am it's I can't help it and I I I think some
people love small talk and they love gossip and they love cocktail party conversations
it's just something that I can't bear it's very difficult for me it takes a tremendous amount
of energy to maintain myself at a three or four hour long dinner party where the conversation
is just idle chatter uh it's I mean I have to have two or three glasses of wine just to take the
edge off and and cope and that may that may be revealing more about me than I want to suggest
but uh it's it's who I am yeah I don't think it's it's judgmental that it came across I feel like
it was very honest but it makes me realize we don't perhaps often get the opportunity to
express in a safe space honestly what does and doesn't work for us in life we are often involved
with situations that are just part of the pattern of existence and we we we tolerate them and we
put our masks on and we we navigate them because we we feel that we have to and I think that's a
great point Natalie and I think my my my personal view is that everyone deep down is craving for
these conversations these deep serious conversations about the meaning of life but they're scary
they're they're frightening conversations because they expose so much that we want to keep hidden
but I think all of us it's I think it's it's it's built into the human condition we we
we are thirsting for these encounters these deep intimate relational encounters what what
Martin Buber calls the IU relation uh where we're open and exposed to the other person and
this is what draws people to therapy this is why people go into to therapy because they want
to be heard they want to have to have someone listen to them in a way that's sincere and open
and um they feel safe in that space in that therapeutic encounter and and that safety oftentimes
isn't there at a at a social gathering or at a party but the more intimate that that social
gathering gets and the and the more close knit that community of friends and and relations is
the greater the opportunity for deeper conversations and and and more penetrating discourse
and I wonder where it is in life that we do become so scared of confronting these questions
because if you think about children children are constantly just exploring all of many facets
of themselves all the many potentials of what life has to offer and they do it with such
just innate fearlessness yeah I think we we it gets socialized out of us I think you're right
I think children are always the best philosophers they're always philosophically inquisitive
and and even inquisitive about the deepest and scariest questions about death you know what happened
to our dog what happened to grandma where do they go after they die why why why and um as as as
young children get socialized in in in school and in educational institutions in in peer relations
they're kind of told you don't ask those questions anymore you do what good boys and girls do
and um and that's a that's sad that's unfortunate and and so we we lose touch with that wide-eyed
openness to the questionability of life that all children have and it gets beaten out of us and
then there's moments in I think late adolescence early adulthood when it wake when we're woken up
again and that's often is happens when you go off to call when you leave home for the first time
right either going to college or go off and and practice a trade at 18 or 19 and you leave the
home and suddenly those questions come up again who am I what's the meaning of my life and um
and and and then we get our degree and we get our job and we start our career we forget those
questions until we get our divorce or we we lose our job or we get a critical illness and then
we're woken up again and um so I think that that the experience of questionability that children have
comes back to us at different points in our lives I also think it comes back to us in at the end of
life that the older we get the more humble we get the more open we get toward mystery
and and questionability and I'm actually finishing a book right now on existentialism and aging
and argue that the aging process and the intimacy that aging brings us with grief and loss
actually makes us into existentialists I think elder the elderly folk tend to be more receptive
to these ideas and there's a lot of interesting evidence to suggest this that we we actually
become existentialists the closer we get to death and the more our future contracts and we realize
that we are temporal beings and life is coming to an end you've set my mind off in a thousand
different questions but I need to to keep it straight and you're speaking about different
literature we've got you know we've got theoretical literature we've got philosophical
perhaps novels and you've mentioned poetry and film what about for the person who's sitting there
and it's like yeah these these russian or french and western philosophers um that they're not my
style like there's no way I could engage with those kind of texts I'm not interested in classical
music I'm not a deep person I'm not a hugely academic or intellectual yeah it's a it's a
good question I think yeah some people just aren't readers some people aren't intellectually inclined
I think one of the great entryways into existential thinking if you're not a literary type
is through film I think there's a lot of really great accessible films that capture
the core ideas of existential philosophy and and some of them are blockbusters with some of
the great stars in Hollywood and so what what film can do is it can demystify the alienating
and intimidating jargon of the existentialists the german terms and the french terms and the
technical language that may be a sartre or a bouvoir or a heidegger would employ
and I'm thinking of of movies like American Beauty this is the movie by Sam Mendes
um The Tree of Life by Terrence Malick um there's a great Nietzschean themed science fiction film
called Arrival um that was directed by Villeneuve Akira Kurosawa the great japanese director of
course has done so many great existential films the greatest is probably Ikuru um about a man who's
who's diagnosed with terminal cancer and he's forced to confront a life that has been largely
bereft of meaning and now he's kind of awakened to the urgency of the limited time that he has left
and so I think film is a great way to introduce and and these films are cross-cultural it's not
as if these are just western filmmakers I mean Ikuru I mean I'm sorry Kurosawa had such a massive
impact on western filmmakers that in many ways he was the pioneer not not not hollywood or or
french or or american filmmakers and Ingmar Bergman films of course uh anything that Bergman does
some Woody Allen films are good although he has demonstrated himself to be a loathsome human being
um so that's one way to do it uh is is through indirectly through film
and I think that's hugely reassuring and partly what this project is aspiring to do because there
isn't for me an obvious go-to place to say I've heard this word this ism as you were speaking
about it doesn't it's coming up a lot it seems that it could be something curious but I am not
able to read these huge huge tomes I I don't know where to start I don't know where to go
and it feels that there's there's there's not just that's kind of stepping stone that opens the door
that says actually you know yes okay we there are so many ways to be it highly academic about this
and explore it from a highly academic position and and encourage that to be incorporated into
different professions and different disciplines but actually we don't have to be so so formal
about it too we can sit back at the cinema we can have a conversation with friends we can just
look at ourselves and say hey who am I and you could show this interview right I mean this I mean
hopefully we're not using too much highfalutin language we're talking in a way that I think
everyone could understand and I think even those that aren't that are intimidated by the big novels
The Crime and Punishment The Brothers Karamazah many of the most powerful and visceral pieces
of existential literature are very short stories the short stories of the death of Yon Ilyak it's
you know 50 page story Camus the stranger is a very short story Dostoevsky has a bunch of
short stories that are that are powerful and accessible the plays of Jean-Paul Sartre are
accessible and and pretty easy to follow and so it's not as if you have to to sit down with a
thousand page piece of Russian literature to absorb the core ideas you can breeze through you know
Camus the stranger at the beach in an afternoon and be jolted into an awareness of of who we are
you know and and so there's no reason to be scared of it it's it's accessible in so many
different kinds of ways I like how you set the setting there like you can just read a
read a nice novel on the beach because you make me realize that it there's almost this sense that
philosophy must be done in in a in a dark room with a with a cigar or a brand out in the dark
or in the woods or in a classroom but actually I live in Florida I do most of my work at the
beach right or outside in the sunshine and and so absolutely yeah we don't have to play that that
stereotype of the the serious French intellectual the beret and the black sweater and smoking a
cigarette at the coffee shop and it's it's a it can be much more relaxed and and I think it's very
accessible and I reckon it was at the time for them as well if half of them were writing at cafes
and coffee shops and bars and having these chats and just writing it down scribbling it down and I
believe to an exact I mean in in in the golden age in the 1940s and 50s in France it was everywhere
I mean existentialism was in the air and it was in the coffee shops in the in the in the
cafe society on the sidewalks but it was also in the air in the United States in that way it was a
big driver of the counterculture revolution and and you know Camus and and Sartre and Beauvoir
were such important political voices and in speaking to the Vietnam War to to the civil
rights movement to the women's movement it was an important part of the new left in in Great Britain
and so it was it was in the air it wasn't it wasn't isolated in in academic settings it wasn't
there in seminar halls it was it was out in the streets is where existentialism had its had its
high point and it'd be wonderful to see that come back in some ways and there are sun glimmers
of hope that that's the case I mean there's there's aspects of the Black Lives Matter movement at
the United States the Me Too movement the Greta Thernbergs climate strike movement that have real
resonances to to existential philosophy in terms of conveying the urgency of our situation
and so my sense is that existentialism is at a is is is coming back it's coming back
in and being received in ways that it that it hasn't in the past coming back from textbooks
and academia into kind of common dialogue and discourse and yeah and also yeah I think coming
back from from a complacency in the face of neoliberal politics and
crass materialism I think that that there's nothing like the recognition that the planet
may be uninhabitable in 40 years to jolt us into an awakening and I see this a lot with my students
I'm not going to I'm 51 years old so the the urgency of the climate change isn't going to hit
me as viscerally but for my 20 year old students they may be living in a planet that is radically
different than the one that I'm living in when they're my age and so when we talk about neolism
or the death of God and the search for meaning the climate change crisis can can jolt us into
an awareness of those kinds of questions and you're bringing us here nicely back into this
discussion that existentialism isn't just theoretical it's not just within our mind but
it's within our embodied world as well it's in the physical world as well and what this leads
back into is what you were sharing about your own your own specialities yeah absolutely and my
and my own life I mean it's it's it's shaped me in deep ways in my own life it's pulled me through
profound catastrophic events in my life near-death events and and if anything my relationship
to this kind of philosophy is more intimate and profound than it's ever been and it's very much
different from the the place that I was when I was an 18 or 20 year old philosopher enamored by
Nietzsche and the radical ideas because I hadn't lived them I hadn't lived these ideas I hadn't
experienced them in the visceral way that you know 30 years of life experience teaches you
and so the wisdom of these thinkers has has become even more pronounced as I've gotten older
and I don't think that's going to change much I think it's it's going to become more pronounced
as I move into my 60s and 70s if I get there if I make it to tomorrow you see it does feel like
an endless absolutely endless journey this the the discovery and exploration of the existential
field I don't I I was going to say I don't know if I love it or I hate it but I think it's definitely
that I love it and it's just any person that you speak to has the potential and quite often does add
a whole mother open door after door after door and you look through and you think wow there's so much
more and I think even the language of love and hate as you know uh is is so is a little bit
misleading it's it's not that you love it or hate it is that it matters to you it matters to you
deeply and so those simple binaries of good and evil or love and hate they it doesn't capture
the ambiguity of of what this field discloses and all that you can say with sincerity is that this
this material means something to me in a deep way even if articulating that meaning is always going
to be inchoate and unclear to the point that people like ourselves are just so inspired
that we dedicate a significant amount of our life to trying to share that or at least invite or
as I would say offering we're offering other people the opportunity to to explore these I really
like Natalie this idea of existential offering I think there's such a wonderful uh openness about
that that phrase what can I offer you and and how can I open you up to the relevance and significance
of these ideas I think that's a a really neat part of the project thank you I I thought of that when
I was when I was sitting during my training and I was just being exposed to all of these different
ideas and I was trying to establish which one I'm supposed to resonate with which particular theory
and how I'm supposed to take it all on board and it suddenly dawned on me that that's not at least
for me that's not what existential philosophies are about they're so magnificently vast and complex
and they will have completely different meanings to each person in each moment depending on where
their situation did and it each one offer an opportunity and offer a different angle and
it's up to us whether we take it or leave it or put it aside for later I agree I agree on that note
how would you describe your existential offering as it were um I guess my existential offering
would in the in the bluntest possible way recognize that this life is not a dress rehearsal
this is the only life you have this day is the only day that is exist that exists right now and
remind yourself or be vigilant to the idea that this this is this existence is precarious
and it's unstable and it's uncertain and that you can't take things for granted
you can't you can't take these relationships for granted you can't take the beauty of a
sunset or a rainy afternoon for granted a good meal for granted or a good cup of coffee
treasure those moments because they can be snatched away from you at any time and I think
recognizing that life is not a dress rehearsal will will bring a measure of intensity and urgency
to aspects of our life that we all too often take for granted
and why is that intensity and urgency so so important
well because it reminds us of how beautiful and precious this life is and and mysterious
and gracious this life is and um if if you're happy with your an existence where you're just
pulled along by the shallows of everyday life um so much the better for you but my sense is that
most of us don't want to live that way we want to live with a sense that this is a life worth living
that this is a life that can have deep meaning if we so choose regardless of the career path that
we take it can be embodied in our relationships in the care that we have for our our sick and dying
parents the way that we love and take care of our children or the environment or the natural world
and so my sense is without that measure of intensity and urgency it's not as much of a life worth living
unfortunately I pick up on how you're saying I sense I sense I sense and is this what you are
referring to in in your in your work earlier when you were saying that this embodied we're
embodied beings as well we're phenomenological beings as well we're not just these yeah yeah I mean
one of the things one of the great insights of the existentialists is that the human condition is
disclosed to us not through theoretical reflection it's disclosed to us through feelings through moods
through affective experience and we the the argument or the suggestion is that we we feel
when we're inauthentic and that feeling is knowledge we know when we're not being true to ourselves
we know when we're wearing we're wearing masks and and being self-deceptive how do we know
it feels a certain way and we are feeling authenticity also feels a certain way
it we feel a particular kind of mood that's atmospheric and it colors our our our entire life
you see it's making me think of how many times we can have this feeling and one that we're not
finding pleasant and one that we're wanting to change and we're finding uncomfortable when
but we're staying we're living with it we can do that for for hours or weeks or months or years
we can live with this sense that we our life is not is not being lived and experienced in the way
that perhaps it should be but yet we're not changing it and that is that embodied sense of
discomfort and I think that you know one of the one of the the underlying themes I think in
in almost all existential philosophy is is courage that you have to have the courage or or steadiness
to be true to who you are and and whenever you feel yourself get sucked back into a life of
self-deception which is always going to happen it's inevitable it's again it's structural to
the human condition uh in authenticity to have the courage to to question that temptation
to challenge it to remind yourself what is at stake in life to remind yourself that this is
a day that you may not get that that the future is an illusion you don't get it tomorrow but tomorrow's
not guaranteed and so why are you going to go to that cocktail party why are you going to join
that committee why are you going to waste that time in a conversation that's going to have no
bearing on your existence is there is there other better ways to live better ways to spend the very
limited time that you have on earth how in those situations do you have the courage to keep going
um it's a good question uh I I
remind myself every day I try to remind myself with a mantra every day life is short life is
short be grateful life is short be grateful I'll say that actually in my car when I'm driving to
work and when I'm walking onto campus I'll be remind I'll remind myself be grateful this day
this day this is the only day and it's hard sometimes you know you get sucked into the
things they sucked into everydayness and and you lose touch with that but I try to
develop a kind of practice this is what what Aristotle calls frenesis it's a practical wisdom
that becomes habit it becomes part of who you are so that you don't have to try anymore to be
grateful you don't have to try anymore to to uh uh be aware of your own temporality or your own
infinitude it it's it just becomes who you are and so you see the sunsets in florida differently
you see the blue sky in a different way you see the trees on campus in a different way and um
that's that's practical wisdom and I hugely appreciate your honesty with that with that
question because I think confronting confronting truth confronting life confronting existence
can be exhausting and overwhelming and there are moments that we don't just innately have that
courage flaring up within us to keep going and to keep exploring but what you're sharing here
is that this is not just a passive process this is an active engagement that's right and that's
again a central theme in in existentialist philosophy I mean the Sartre and Beauvoir
actually call it engage literature that the the writing has to be engaged with the concrete
realities of existence and we have to bring that engagement into our own lives so that it's not
just something that we scribble down on a page it's something that we embody in in our everyday
lives and and it's hard work it's very difficult because self-deception is very easy it's easy to
be inauthentic and it's nice it's comforting and and and tranquilizing as heidegger says
and also that it you know we we go through that phase where it was respectful to be to
tranquilize ourselves it was respectful to switch off our questioning brain and to queue up in the
playground and and sit down in the classroom and study something that isn't connecting with you
we're trained to do that and you're you're told off if you're not and you're being respectful
if you do and then suddenly it all changes again and yeah I agree I agree but thank you so much
for sharing today Kevin I'm wondering was a pleasure Natalie it was a real pleasure to have
this conversation and I hope that whoever sees it appreciates it as well and it was really
fun for me to have this talk and may hopefully our paths will cross sometime in real life
in the future I'm sure we'll make that happen and I'm sure it will inspire I hope so too
thank you so much Kevin it's my pleasure okay we'll talk soon bye bye
