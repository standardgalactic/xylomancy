Okay, so what we have here is a large bubble algae.
You can see the two smaller ones on the left and right side
that give you a size reference.
Here's my finger, so that gives you an idea of how big it is.
It's about the size of the golf ball.
It's pretty huge.
One of these, it pops.
There are thousands of small ones about the size of a beady.
Once those things get all over the aquarium and they pop,
there will be some more ones that will be about the size of a beady.
So, one this big could theoretically be about a million
of these little sea bassers all over the place.
So, yeah, it's pretty neat.
What's actually cool about this one is it's so big.
The reflection opposite shows it's actually got different types
of light reflections, you can see.
So, yeah, pretty cool.
It's too bad it had to come out,
but I don't really want to be pulling these out for the next few weeks.
