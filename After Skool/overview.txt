Checking After Skool/DIVIDE & RULE - The Plan of The 1% to Make You DISPOSABLE - Vandana Shiva.txt
1. Vandana Shiva discusses the historical context of divide and rule tactics, citing the Indian Act of 1906 in South Africa as an example of how marginalized groups were treated to maintain power for the elite.

2. She explains the concept of Satyagreha, a form of nonviolent resistance made famous by Mahatma Gandhi and inspired by Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience, which Martin Luther King Jr. also adopted in the American civil rights movement.

3. Shiva highlights the economic violence inherent in the term "economy," which originally meant the art of living but has evolved into the art of making money, leading to exploitation and harm to people and the planet.

4. She warns against the potential for technology, particularly artificial intelligence, to render 99% of the population disposable by automating jobs that were previously held by humans.

5. Shiva advocates for the concept of "earth democracy," where we recognize our interconnectedness with all life on Earth and strive for a future that values love, abundance, sustainability, and the freedoms of all species and human beings.

6. She emphasizes the importance of unity and shared humanity as the political project of our times, urging collective action to prevent the erosion of rights and freedoms due to exploitative economic policies.

7. Shiva's mission is to continue learning and understanding the world through an ecological perspective, advocating for respect and reverence for nature and life, and warning against the "debt of destruction" that we are incurring.

8. She criticizes those who bring war under the guise of peace, divide societies for control, and manipulate democracy for their own ends.

9. Shiva's speech is a call to action for recognizing our shared humanity and Earth, and to work together to ensure that we do not become a disposable population in an increasingly automated world.

Checking After Skool/Exposing Scientific Dogmas - Banned TED Talk - Rupert Sheldrake.txt
 The speaker discusses the importance of questioning scientific dogmas to foster new research and insights. They provide an example from metrology, where the value of the gravitational constant (G) is currently considered fixed, despite evidence suggesting it may fluctuate. The speaker advocates for the raw data used to measure G to be made publicly available online with dates and measurements to investigate potential fluctuations over time.

The speaker then shifts to a more profound topic: the nature of consciousness and the mind. They argue that the prevailing view, which locates all experiences within the brain, is too narrow and does not account for phenomena such as the sense of being stared at or the possibility that our minds extend beyond our physical brains. They suggest that vision involves an outward projection of images, implying that what we see is not confined to our heads but extends into the external world.

The speaker also touches on the evolutionary context of this "outward projection," suggesting it could have evolved from predator-prey interactions. They emphasize the importance of re-evaluating these dogmatic assumptions in consciousness studies, which could lead to a new understanding of our minds' workings and potentially revolutionize the field of science.

The speaker concludes by expressing their faith in science and the potential for a scientific renaissance if we move beyond these limiting beliefs, leading to more vibrant and life-affirming research. They believe that science can be regenerated through open inquiry and the willingness to challenge established norms.
