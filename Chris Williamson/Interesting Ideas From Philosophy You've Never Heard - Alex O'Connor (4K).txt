Alex O'Connor, welcome to the show.
How splendidly we progress.
The first time on a Skype call,
the second time was in person in Austin,
and now it's something of a sort of cinematic production.
I fear that next time we'll be in 3D or something.
It's good to see you again.
Good to see you as well, mate.
How are you feeling in the aftermath of Peter Hitchens?
Validated, vindicated.
I must say that I was a little bit...
I was in two minds about uploading that interview.
There was a bit of a mixture of opinion coming from him.
He wasn't speaking entirely clearly.
Must have been something on his mind.
He said, as he's getting up to walk out,
I don't think you should run this.
And I'm thinking, look, if my guest tells me
that they don't want me to run an interview for any reason,
it could be because they've had a bad hair day,
then I'll respect that.
And so I thought, damn, am I really going to have to, you know,
be the bigger man here and just not post this at all?
But then he kept saying, oh, run it if you like.
I can't stop you from running it.
I just don't think you have any moral right to run it.
And I asked him why.
And he said it was because I am a propagandist
for drug decriminalization, a subject which,
prior to that, by the way, I'd spoken about once ever.
And that I'd intentionally tricked him to appear on my podcast
in order that I might fool him into a conversation about drugs.
Before the podcast started, I said, Mr. Hitchens,
you have about three subject areas that we both talk about
where I think there's a bit of crossover
that you've either spoken about or indeed written books about.
And those are the decriminalization of drugs.
I also mentioned this in my email.
The existence of God or religion, I should say,
God and religion is the topic.
And the third was monarchy.
At this point, he says, well, you know, monarchy is a bit boring.
Okay, notice listener that he did not take this opportunity
to tell me that he thought that drugs were a bit boring
or would rather not really talk about drugs at all or for too long.
Okay, fine.
So I'm thinking, I agree with you, the monarchy is incredibly boring.
In fact, that's the entirety of my point about the monarchy
is that it's essentially just boring more than anything else.
So let's just do the other two.
So I say we'll run for about an hour, ideally.
He says, that's good, you know, and I say, but, you know,
if the conversation flows, it can be an hour and a half.
It could be two hours.
And okay, he says, well, look, you know,
I say sometimes they can be three hours long.
He says, well, three hours might be a bit long, but we'll see how we do.
So I'm thinking about an hour and a half.
An hour and a half on what was now, in my view, two subjects.
So at about 40 minutes into this potentially 90 minute podcast
on the same topic when he told me that we've been going around
for too long on that topic, I was a little bit bemused.
But I did think to myself, maybe I've done something wrong here.
Maybe I have upset him in a way that obviously was not intentional.
You know, I wasn't trying to bring this out of him,
although, you know, it does do quite well for the channel.
It's not like it's something I would do intentionally.
So I did think to myself, well, maybe I've done something.
So I listened back and I sent it to some friends, including you,
and thank you for listening to it and saying that like,
most people just said, you have to run this.
He's been completely unreasonable.
And so there have been criticisms.
People have said, well, you know what, it was a bit boring.
Or yeah, it was going around in circles.
I submit that that was his fault, by the way,
because he does this thing which I've noticed
in a lot of philosophical and political discussion,
which is the sort of, I know this one attitude.
When you do a lot of interviews, I find that you have a sort of,
I know this one.
And so...
They answer the question that they heard,
not the answer that was asked.
Exactly.
And it happens, especially when it's easy enough
to make that mistake if you're not listening carefully.
So he was talking about the...
Well, I asked him about the decriminalization of cannabis
and he says that, well, this will essentially mean
that a lot of more children will be smoking it.
He had this contention that children would end up smoking cannabis.
And I thought to myself, well, okay,
I can understand that concern, of course,
but I think the tobacco industry has suffered quite a blow
in still being perfectly legal to buy as an adult,
but the kids just aren't smoking cigarettes anymore.
It's just not a thing that's really done.
Why is that?
In other words, we've had quite a successful education campaign
whereby it's not popular for kids to smoke anymore
and yet it's still perfectly legal.
Can't we have a similar approach to cannabis?
Potentially, by the way, not a good view.
Potentially a perfectly rebuttable view.
I'm not sure, but I wouldn't know
because they didn't get a rebuttal to that view.
Instead, I just heard, you know, all you can do is do the whole,
which by the way is a genuinely quite tired line in this debate,
the whole, oh, what about smoking?
Or indeed another point where I brought up alcohol.
All you can say is what about alcohol?
What about smoking?
And that's not what I was doing.
At least I can tell that's not what I was doing.
Because that's what he heard.
He goes, oh, I know this one.
I've heard this before.
Yeah, and you haven't read my book.
It seemed to occur to him that it is possible, Mr. Hitchens,
to read your book and yet still, after having done so,
disagree with you.
Yeah, it's sometimes when you hear people speak,
especially guys that are a little bit older, I think,
there is kind of like reverse ageism that goes on,
which is who is this sort of young whipper snapper person
who I maybe have heard of or haven't heard of much.
And almost like a blas√© kind of discrediting of the thing.
It's like, this is your show, but it's my show, so to speak.
And yeah, it was like, I thought his attitude was pompous
and unlikable, and my favorite part was when he threw
the pillow at the microphone.
Throwing the pillow down.
And he kept sort of walking back over.
He says, you know, I don't want you to post this
and yet walk back over to the microphone.
I've never said anything about you before.
I've decided that I absolutely do not like you.
It was quite something.
And a lot of people messaged me saying, hey,
like, I'm so sorry that happened.
Like, you know, you're doing all right.
And I'm thinking, sorry, sorry.
I thought there's no way that this is happening.
I mean, when it looked like he was about to get up,
I thought, surely not.
But then internally, I'm thinking like, go on then, do it.
Go on then, yeah.
Do it, because I don't think I've done anything wrong here.
It was the podcasting equivalent of come on, mate, have a go.
Yeah, but you know, the weirdest thing was
because he sort of gets up to go and he walks out
and he stands at the door.
And I wish you kind of could have seen his body language.
It was very much, there's one point where you can see it
when he walks back into shot and he says something.
And then after he said it, he just sort of stands there
looking at me as if to say, like, what have you got?
Have a go.
I keep going like, I'm going to go now.
I'm going.
Right.
I'm going and waiting.
It's just the podcast playing hard to get equivalent.
It must have been something like that.
Yeah, it was like the person who wants the fight
but wants to look like they didn't initiate the fight.
Right.
And I don't think it's my fault.
I'll leave it up to the judgment of the listener or the viewer.
I don't think it's my fault that he spent 17 minutes, 17 count them.
17 entire minutes stood at the door
telling me how much he personally dislikes me,
telling me how much he doesn't want to see me again.
I've wanted to do that for as long as I've known you.
Well, we'll see how we did.
Yeah, today.
You're going to try and convince me of the existence of God today.
You managed to convince chat GPT.
That's right.
Which means, does it mean that I'm smarter than chat GPT
if you convince me more quickly or more slowly or not at all?
I don't know.
I do know that it means that...
Well, chat GPT, if it's going to inherit eternal life,
I sort of wonder how that's going to work in heaven.
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know if I've made it...
Just this recursive nightmare for everyone as they walk around
and they've got the chat GPT logo floating about.
Yeah.
The interesting thing about chat GPT is that you sort of...
You can essentially convince it of anything.
And so, I wasn't quite sure if it was even a very good video idea
because I'm sure I could just as easily convince it that God doesn't exist.
Well, at least you can be thankful that it wasn't able to say
it had no opinion of you before,
but it absolutely does not like you and then get up and walk out.
Quite right.
Some people in the comments did say that at least chat GPT stuck around until the end.
That would be a task.
In fact, that's another video idea.
I got chat GPT to storm out of an interview.
Even I probably couldn't do that.
Didn't this get brought up?
You debated Ben Shapiro yesterday.
How did that go?
I haven't even seen you.
It went well.
I think it will probably be out around the time of this interview,
maybe slightly before or slightly afterwards.
It was a good conversation.
We were discussing whether or not religion is good for society.
It stands for young Benjamin to take at the moment.
I suppose so.
I mean, it was a very much sort of don't mention the war type scenario.
I mean, the producers had said that we want this to be an evergreen conversation.
We want this to be something that people can listen to at any point.
And also, Ben had just the night before been to the Oxford Union.
And I haven't seen that yet either.
I saw that.
He went had at it with a bunch of people on the other side of the fence.
Yeah.
He didn't have a very good time.
He said to me that it was the most tense thing that he's ever done.
The most tense thing he's ever, ever been a part of.
Well, I saw something that was kind of interesting was the video was only shot on what appeared to be iPhone.
Yes.
So there was no, maybe they just wanted to get it early as opposed to waiting for the Oxford Union's official video to come through.
Seems to be the case.
They do seem to be planning to upload it.
In fact, when I was recording with Ben, I think his team were in the green room, sort of furiously subtitling to try and get it out potentially before the Oxford Union.
Right.
I'm not entirely sure.
But I mean, it sounded like a hell of an evening.
And so the next day he was saying that it sort of felt like a nice break from that.
What, to sit opposite you?
Well, you are the comfortable leather pair of shoes that he can put on.
I think Ben relaxes in argumentation.
I think he genuinely enjoys it.
I think there's no contradiction to say that he was having some time off by sitting there and having a spat.
Playing with you.
But he was having a break from the politics.
Right.
In other words, he was able to just argue about something a bit more perennial and a little less fiery, I suppose.
What have you learned?
So you are, I've been a massive fan of you since before you came on the podcast and since then we've become friends and you've come out to see me in Austin.
We spent a ton of time together.
You're probably my favorite person to watch debate people because it's kind of a little bit like watching Batman versus Spider-Man or something.
Because I know you well and we've argued a lot.
And I know maybe Ben Shapiro, but I don't know what will happen when these two people come together.
You were president of SockSock.
The Socratic Society, yes.
You were part of DebateSock and all of this other stuff at Oxford.
Given that you've got a relatively illustrious heritage of both formal and informal debates, what is your assessment of Ben Shapiro's debating style, his ethical consistency, his ability to deploy logic, et cetera, et cetera.
Now that you've gone mano a mano in the ring.
Well, he has obviously an incredibly high verbal IQ.
He constructs a sentence out of nowhere and do it very quickly.
And he's also very difficult to interrupt.
Not that I particularly wanted to.
I mean, he would throw sort of maybe two or three points out at once and you want to butt in and do them one by one.
You don't want to be rude, of course.
So I let him finish, but it was amazing how they just glued together into one wall of text.
I've seen comments on some of the videos that I was watching of him in preparation to talk to him where people were not being funny in saying that they play the video on 0.75 speed.
Because it makes him sound normal.
There was sort of an episode with Constantine and Francis, Trigonometry, and he's talking about religion and its relation to the fentanyl crisis.
And people were saying that if you...
And it was very fast.
And if you play it on 0.75, you forget that you've done that and you're just hearing somebody talk at a normal volume at a normal speed and then Constantine comes in sounding like a blue whale or something.
So he's very quick.
But also I thought very charitable.
This is the thing.
I think people get Ben Shapiro wrong.
I went to his Cambridge Union event after this discussion slash debate because it was in Cambridge.
That's why we were out there.
And so I went to this event and I was talking to a lot of the students afterwards.
And you hear a lot of people saying about Ben Shapiro that he's a bit of a grifter or, well, I'm not really a fan.
Or you have the sort of secret fans who are sat in the chamber going like, well, you know, I think it's just important.
If you're going to disagree with someone, you sort of have to hear the thing that you're going to disagree with in the flesh.
You can say that you like Ben Shapiro.
It's okay, you know.
But people see this side of him of the sort of slightly sneering, smarmy, owning the college student kind of thing.
But I think in many ways he matches the energy that he's given.
And so taking him seriously and listening to what he's saying and being willing to concede a point to him, he will do the same thing.
And I think that happened in this conversation.
You know, it's steadfast.
We're saying what we think to each other.
At one point, we both accuse each other simultaneously of being delusional.
But in such a manner that if you say something, you get a sort of like, yeah, no, that's a fair point, actually.
Maybe we should put it this way instead.
Or, yeah, you know, actually, I see what you're saying.
No, you're right.
I should have said this instead.
That kind of attitude, which is the kind of thing that people think Ben Shapiro is incapable of for some reason.
Humility.
You know what I mean?
It's a hidden humility because it comes out not in the attitude, not in a sort of, he's not going to give way to you emotion.
He's not going to be like, oh, you're right.
It would just be if you pay attention to the way he's constructing an argument and changing it subtly based on your responses.
You know, that he really is listening and really is trying to engage with what you're actually saying.
And that's the kind of humility that I don't think can really be faked.
Yeah, I am friends with a bunch of guys that have worked with him over the years.
I know for a fine fact that part of his debate prep involves a number of break glass in case of mass offense, sort of escape hatches, and that there's layers of how deep and how aggressive he can go.
So I would love to know, actually, I might email him and find out what he's got on you just in case I ever need to actually pull that pin.
Well, he said to me when he walked in, I saw the Peter Hitchens thing, as everybody's been saying to me recently.
So he'd at least seen that.
So he knows how I behave.
And he knows, in other words, that if he did start sort of screaming at me that I would probably just sit there and take it.
Right.
Okay.
Like the philosophical cuck that you are.
Right.
Yeah.
You're kind of a little...
There's another quote for the foot of bio, I think.
Yeah.
Have you updated it too?
I absolutely do not.
I've decided I do not like you, Peter Hitchens.
It's in there somewhere.
I think it's I actively dislike you is the quote that's now on my bio.
I'm constantly shifting it around.
I don't think I'll ever get rid of unusually penetrating.
What was it that you were doing?
What was it that you did for a while, making theists question their beliefs and lesbians question their sexuality since...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I remember that in your bio.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
We really haven't had each other a long time.
You know what I found yesterday?
I sort of stumbled across it while looking for an email trying to find out where we were filming today.
And I found the original email that you sent me in, it must have been 2019 when we first met.
And it was amazing.
It was this sort of, hi Alex, been watching your stuff for a while.
Like it was sort of three, four paragraphs of texts.
I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with you.
I think that your views will be of big interest to my views.
And then I've already spoken to these people and it was a bunch of people that I hadn't heard of.
Wasn't really in my sphere.
And it signed off Chris Williamson Voodoo events.
Fantastic.
Yeah.
Wow, my previous life.
Yeah.
Filling nightclubs in my signature until only six months ago and I realized that I needed to get rid of it.
But no, it's cool man.
I think, you know, if I could invest money in people, you, George Mack, Zach, my housemate,
Gwinda Bogle, Rob Henderson, you know, even Rory Sutherland, I don't think that the market has priced in his talent.
And it's so funny because like what I did for almost all of my career in nightlife was find different kind of talent, right?
It was like degenerate party talent.
But find kids that had a good work ethic and some skill and then bring them in and sort of train them up.
So keeping your finger on the pulse of what's happening with regards to trends, if who is appropriate and blah, blah, blah.
But yeah, man, I'm, you know, there is a point, I will happily say it now.
There is a point that's going to occur within the next few years where something happens with you being involved that just catapults you into like superstardom.
Like I would absolutely bet a shit ton of money that this is going to happen.
You've got some, what's that big thing you're doing soon?
Can we announce the big thing that you're doing soon, that even bigger debate?
I think not.
Right.
Only because it's still very much up in the air.
Okay.
However, if and when that happens, it's going to break the internet.
That could be it.
Yeah.
Unless this does it for me.
Very well might do.
This is the biggest platform you've been on.
So when was the last time that you're aware of in your world of philosophy that something like a step change, like the equivalent of the discovery of the Higgs boson happened?
In philosophy?
Yeah.
Every now and again, something does come along that's a bit revolutionary.
And a recent example, and by recent, consider we're talking about the history of philosophy here, 20th century, the theory of knowledge is completely exploded by a man called Edmund Getier.
And this is actually, I think, quite fascinating.
I'll be interested to hear what you think about this.
So knowledge is really difficult to define.
People didn't used to have as much of a problem with it.
Like if you had to give a definition of knowledge, what does it mean to know something?
This isn't like a trick question.
I'm just interested.
What do you think?
To know something, to be able to accurately predict what happens in the world.
Okay.
So you've got something to do with it being true in the world and your ability to predict.
But you can also think about things in the past, right?
Like you can know that Napoleon existed or something.
So prediction.
And the ability to infer.
Yeah, to infer, to sort of, to have some kind of belief about the world.
Which is accurate.
Which is accurate, which is true.
Sure.
But then imagine, for example, you're in a, you're in like a locked concrete box with no windows.
And I don't know, like some voodoo mystic tells you that it's raining outside.
And they're just like insane.
They're on drugs or something.
And they just tell you that it's raining.
They're convinced of it.
And for some reason, you believe them totally irrationally.
And it just so happens that it is, by coincidence, raining outside.
Did you know?
Right.
So you have a belief about the world, which is true, but it would seem very strange to
say that you know there's raining outside, right?
And so since Plato and the ancients, we've sort of had a consensus on the idea that knowledge
is justified true belief, JTB.
So you need to have a belief that's true.
You need to, of course, believe it to be true.
But you have to also be justified in that belief.
And that's what makes it knowledge.
So if you see that it's raining outside through the window and you believe that it's raining
outside, and then it's true that it's raining outside, now you can say you know that it's
raining outside.
Right.
And this is just essentially consensus for potentially thousands of years we're talking
about here.
And then Edmund Getty, and at least one account, this may be apocryphal, but it's said that
he sort of hadn't really published anything and was being compelled to get something in
a journal.
And he just sort of reaches into his papers of random things he's been writing, pulls
up the one on the top and hands it off for submission.
This is about two or three pages long, and it just upends the whole thing with essentially
a counter example, which you're now known as Getty air cases.
So his example was to say, okay, imagine that you're in a job interview and your interview
goes really quite well.
And the person says to you, you know, I shouldn't really be saying this, but I think you've
got it.
And so you go back outside and you're feeling pretty good.
There are other candidates, but you've got a pretty justified reason to think that you're
going to get the job.
Then the other guy goes in and while you're waiting for him, you know, you're just fiddling
around in your pocket and you take out whatever you got in your pocket and you've got 10 coins
and you're just fiddling with the 10 coins.
So you develop a justified belief that the person who's going to get the job has 10 coins
in his pocket because you're pretty sure you're going to get the job.
And you've just by chance, you just had a look and you've got 10 coins.
So you got a justified belief that the person who's going to get the job has 10 coins in
their pocket.
There's been some kind of like freak mistake or something.
Maybe they've read your name wrong on the form or the person who told you they thought
you've got it meant to speak to the other person, but it turns out the other guy actually
gets the job.
But just by sheer coincidence, he also has 10 coins in his pocket.
The question is, did you know that the person who would get the job would have 10 coins
in his pocket?
You have a justified true belief that the person who gets the job would have 10 coins
in his pocket.
But it seems in this circumstance, you didn't know that.
That just seems wrong.
It seems like a wrong account.
It's a bit of a sort of clunky example, and he gives another one, which is also maybe
a little bit clunky, but this sort of sparks this type of affair called a getty-er case.
Well, you told me, I think over dinner, the best getty-er case, which was the person behind
the hedge.
Yes.
So...
This is better.
I think so.
So I think it's actually better.
And there are simpler explanations as well.
So I was in a car driving around a bend, and over the hedge, I see this small child sort
of bouncing up and down behind the hedge.
And I thought to myself, oh, cool, I'm about to see a horse.
I mean, it looked like the kid was riding a horse, and I was like, yeah, cool, we're
going to see a horse.
And we ride around this bend, and the kid was actually on his or her dad's back.
And that's why she was high up and bouncing up and down.
But just by sheer coincidence in the field behind them was a horse.
And I couldn't believe it.
I thought, I've just experienced a getty-er case.
I had a justified true belief that I was about to see a horse.
The difficulty with that one is that it's probably not justified to believe that I was
about to see a horse, because I probably should have thought that it could have been a father.
But a much more simple example, and this actually happened to me once, I was in the US Capitol
building in the crypt, and they had the clock that used to be in the House of Representatives.
They said that the reason they replaced it and brought it down here was because they
were fed up of winding it up.
They didn't want to wind it anymore.
And I looked at it, and I asked the tour guide lady, I said, well, do they still wind it
while it's down here?
And she said, no.
And I thought, but it's the real, it's the time.
It says the time right now.
And she was like, oh, it must be a coincidence.
And I was like the only one looking around like, hey, that's pretty extraordinary.
I mean, I guess it happens twice a day, right?
But this is a getty-er case.
If your watch breaks, but you don't know that it's broken, you've got a reliable watch,
but today it's broken.
And you look at the time, and it stopped on half past three.
And so you look at anything, oh, it must be half past three.
And it does actually just so happen to be half past three.
Did you know it was half past three?
That's a getty-er case, justified true belief.
And yet it seems weird to say that you know it.
So getty-er's revelation here was something like what you're talking about, a sort of
genuine novelty in the history of philosophy.
And they come about quite rarely, but they do occur.
This episode is brought to you by Element.
Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything that you need and nothing that
you don't.
It's a healthy alternative to sugary electrolyte drinks.
It's got a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
You might ask, what do I want with an electrolyte drink?
Well, it'll regulate your appetite, it'll curb cravings, it'll help improve your brain
function.
And best of all, it tastes phenomenal.
The first thing in the morning, this orange element salt in water is outstanding.
You're a denicine system that caffeine acts on isn't even active for the first 90 minutes
of the day.
So it's pointless having a morning coffee.
You're adrenal system, which is what salt acts on is active.
So this will make you feel more alert, more awake, and improve your hydration.
Best of all, they've got a no BS, no questions asked refund policy, so you can buy it.
And if you do not like it for any reason, they will give you your money back.
That's how confident they are that you love it.

What happens downstream from that in the world of philosophy?
Just a massive migraine, basically.
People start coming up with arguments, responses, you know.
So people start saying, oh, maybe it's not justified true belief, maybe it's like causally
related justification to the cause of the.
But presumably kind of in the same way that I guess a new scientific discovery is made
about the way that we metabolize glucose or about what happens if you take this amount
of nicotine or the role of metformin in preventing high blood pressure or something.
There are stacked on top of that one assumption, a number of other assumptions.
But with philosophy, especially something I imagine like the philosophy of knowledge,
it's so foundational that having this entire universe built on this particular foundation
then means that the entire house of cards collapses down and people then need to rebuild
all of this nightmare on top of it.
Yeah.
Well, most of philosophy is just a consistency test as it is in something like mathematics.
It's just that we accept that there are certain axioms that even even mathematical axioms,
you know, you can you can you can question them.
I mean, Veritasium just made a quite good video about Euclidean geometry and how it
sort of just accepted for a very long time that, for example, you know, if you have a
right angle, then if you sort of join up the two lines coming off that right angle, you'll
create a triangle whose interior angles add up to 180 degrees.
And then people start thinking about what about like curved geometric spaces?
What if you do this on a globe?
If you put a triangle on a globe, the angles aren't going to add up in that way.
And these these are sort of like axioms of mathematics that essentially they don't necessarily
get proved wrong or thrown out, but people realize that you can think about things differently.
And so most of what we're doing is actually just testing for consistency.
And so it's actually quite difficult to prove an axiom wrong because you kind of need an
axiom just to get off the ground.
And the rest of everything you're doing is just consistency tests with that axiom.
This is one of the most interesting things I learned from you, maybe in the first ever
episode that we did, as you were teaching me about the difference between ethics and
meta ethics as someone that isn't formally trained in either.
And you I use this all the time.
It's such an interesting mental model to think that in order for me and you to have a discussion
about ethics, our meta ethical foundation, we need to agree on that because out of that,
if we don't, the entire ethical discussion on top will just continue to fall back to
definitional problems and what you're presuming that so you can't discuss the stuff that happens
on top if you unless you discuss the stuff that's underneath.
And this is it's the entirety of the trans debate, right?
It's the entirety of lexical overwhelm that if you can't agree on the definition of words,
the argument about the words and what they then refer to just collapses in on itself
and continuously just falls back to an argument about the definition of words.
Yes, this happens with, for example, freedom.
There are lots of different ways of conceiving of freedom, famously freedom from and freedom to,
right? Is freedom just being left alone or is freedom being empowered to do things that you
should be able to do? And then when you have people arguing about nationalized health care,
for example, one person says, to be free, you need to be healthy.
And one person says to be free, you need to spend your own money as you please and not be
forced to fund other people's health care. Now, both of these people can be right.
They're just defining freedom differently. So you're quite right.
And that's why meta ethics is quite important.
AJA I pointed out in Language, Truth and Logic that the vast majority of ethical debate is not
ethical debate. It's descriptive debate. It's factual debate. If you look at the so-called
ethical debate around gun laws in America, for example, people are talking about statistics
as saying X many people die per year. Oh, well, don't you know that more children are killed by
swimming pools? Don't you know that if we ban certain types of weapons or blah, blah, blah,
that this many less people will die? All these kinds of things are just descriptive factual
statements that people like to dispute with each other. And that's why they like to say we have
the facts on our side. But the actual ethical question that undergirds it all is hardly ever
even reached. And so most of the time, people are actually arguing about that. I mean, the same
thing with an abortion debate, for example, questions about biology. When does consciousness
emerge? Can it survive on its own outside of the womb this week or this week, this kind of stuff?
Will it increase the number of women who die or decrease the number of women who die?
But none of these are ethical questions. And people think they're having an ethical debate
when they're actually just having a debate about facts that can be resolved in principle by scientific
empirical inquiry. The ethical question is the more interesting one that's often assumed. And
if people think that they agree with each other or understand each other in the same way on that
ethical first point, then you're in for a disaster. If they don't, I mean.
Yeah, what do you wish that more people could realize when it comes to understanding ethics
and consistency in their own lives? Is there something that a little red pill or a particular
insight that you wish you could deposit into the mind of the populace that you think would make
their lives a little bit more easy or their sense making a bit more simple?
I don't know about making lives easier, but I do think that people should recognize the
extent to which emotions dominate our ethical thinking. I think it's seen as a relatively
eccentric view that ethics just is the expression of emotion. This was something popularized by
that same AJ Ayer in a book that was so troubling to the philosophical consensus at the time that
there's a story of, I think it was like a, maybe a dean of Balliol College or something who,
when a student came in, everybody wanted to talk about this book and they were so
scared of the implications of it that he literally throws it out of the window because
he just doesn't want to talk about it because AJ is talking about how the only things that can
be meaningful are those which are analytically true or empirically verifiable. If the statement
you're making isn't something you can at least in principle test empirically or something that's
just a tautology, two and two is four, then what you're saying is literally meaningless.
And people came to him and said, well, what about ethical statements? You can't prove these
in principle and they're not tautological. And he said, well, the way that they're meaningful
is that they are expressions of emotion. And it gives birth to this view called emotivism,
which is really a philosophy of language more than a philosophy of ethics. It tries to describe what
people mean when they say good or bad. And famously, he comes up with this analogy that
saying murder is wrong, it's like saying, boo murder, saying murder is giving to charity as good as
like saying yay charity, it's just an expression of emotion. It's not even the same thing as saying,
I like charity, or I don't like murder. Because those things can be true or false,
they have truth value, it could be true that it is just a psychological fact that I don't like
murder. He means murder is wrong, that statement is just the expression of the emotion, boo murder.
And I think even if you don't agree with him to that extent, as I more or less do,
if you begin to recognize the extent to which emotions are dominating your ethical conduct,
pay attention to what it feels like when you analyze something is wrong.
I think it belongs in the same category as-
Because you've got this sort of-
Emotion.
...sweet of soup of stimulus going on inside of you. What is it like to feel like something is wrong?
And we know that people seem to change what they rationally do based on how they're feeling.
I mean, I don't know if you've come across terror management theory before. It surprised me if you
hadn't. The idea that all human beings are doing is trying to manage their fear of death.
And that's what motivates all human activity. And there have been some interesting studies,
and some of them are harder to replicate than others. But I mean, the first one,
the most famous was some, I think, Arizona state judges. And they were being asked to recommend
a bond for the solicitation of prostitution. And what the researchers did was they asked them to
fill out just a form first. And on half of the forms, they just mentioned death.
They just put in a few questions about death. What do you think happens after death?
You know, who would you put in your will? That kind of stuff. Nothing too extreme.
And they found that the bond that was set by the judges, I mean, I think the average bond
for the control group was less than $100. And for the ones who were reminded of their death,
there's might two or $300 on average. What does that imply?
The interpretation of terror management theory was that when we're reminded of our deaths,
we need to temporarily, more heavily reaffirm the sort of death-denying aspects of our culture.
The reason that we do things, the reason we create art, the reason that we get out of bed,
the reason that we have conversations like this is because in some way it's traceable back to
trying to essentially deny our own death. Ernest Becker wrote a book called The Denial of Death.
And this is essentially the idea. And so for judges, it might be something like by participating
in the legal system, they're participating in something that's a bit beyond them,
and therefore it exists outside of their own mortality. And so the thesis, this mortality
salience hypothesis, as it's known, is that for a judge, if they're reminded of their own death,
what they will temporarily be compelled to do is more harshly reaffirm that thing that is,
the death-denying aspects of their daily life, which is participation in the legal system,
so more harsh penalties. Now, that to me seems, the explanation seems a little bit tenuous,
I'm not sure about that. But it does seem strange that when you remind people of their own death,
they will, Christians and like Muslims will become more derogatory towards Jews.
People of different nationalities will sit further away from each other.
People will, when asked to draw pictures of currency, will draw physically larger pictures
of currency. People's opinion on whether they prefer a picture of a forest or a picture of,
you know, suburban neighborhood will change on average. Like these things are extraordinary,
just from being reminded of your own death. Of course, the biggest manifestation of the denial
of death would be religion. And that would also explain why, you know, religion deals a lot
with death and why sort of, if you remind people of their own death, they also become religious,
which by the way is true of atheists as well. People who don't believe in God will still become
more religious, even if they don't ultimately believe in God when reminded of their own death.
Yeah, I've been thinking a good bit recently about how people
do an awful lot, especially in the modern world, that is death denialism,
masquerading as something else. I think the productivity movement very much is that,
you know, trying to fit more into less time. If only I could get more life, more work,
more output out of my one unit of days or whatever. I think that a good chunk of the health and
fitness world, the longevity movement, the biohacking movement, all of that is absolutely
death denialism. And you can see as well, nutrition, all of the arguments about, is it better for me
to be carnivore or vegan? Should I go high carb or low carb? Can I do intermittent fasting?
Should I be using ketones exogenously? Ultimately, the reason that I think these arguments are so
vehement and passionate, especially when you think it's diet, guys, right? It's diet. It's like,
I want to have aspartame, you want to have sugar. Like, how does my aspartame consumption
impact your sugar consumption? But what it hits at for a lot of people is a certainty about,
I can predict and project out into the future, how long I'm going to be able to live or die,
and I'm going to be able to compare myself to this other person. And their conviction
in their particular approach, which derogates my approach implicitly, suggests to me,
you're going to die sooner. And that causes me to be fucking terrified. It's the same reason why
people are so, how long do you need to do? It's not VO2 max that's most important, it's HRV,
it's not, it's resting heart rate, it's not, it's galvanic skin temperature. We're not
looking at that, we're looking at telomere length, we're not looking at that, it's whatever, all
of the things, you know, the entire field of health and fitness, which I'm a big part of,
I think is a good chunk of it is death denialism, just masquerading as getting big biceps.
Yes. Sometimes it is more obvious. I think we need more nihilist health influencers who will
sort of say, you know, when the question is asked, you know, should you eat white bread or brown
bread or whatever it is, you know, that they'll sort of begin with the question. It sort of
depends on your views on the intrinsic value of life. Also, if you're a bit of a utilitarian,
I mean, people often say that being unhealthy might be unethical because in a country with
nationalised healthcare, you're a burden, but are you? I mean, who costs the taxpayer more,
the person who eats a bunch of burgers and has a heart attack and dies instantly,
or the person who lives into old age and therefore has some kind of long-term health
problem like Alzheimer's. I need to interject here. So you ring me probably three years ago,
four years ago, you ring me and I'm in the gym and you say something like, what are you doing?
I say, I'm in the gym. What are you doing? Oh, just whatever, whatever. Catch up a little bit.
I was like, what's going on? What's happening? And you said, I'm trying nihilism. And I said,
what do you mean? And you went, as a life philosophy, I'm trying nihilism. And I still
don't know what you mean. So how is your experiment to make nihilism great again going?
Well, I was getting a bit fed up of people saying, oh, you're a nihilist. Oh,
you're an atheist. Well, they wouldn't say it in the terms of nihilism. They say,
oh, you're an atheist. Yeah, right. Yeah. I mean, there was a cliff of Jordan Peterson on
the Lex Friedman podcast. And he says, oh, you're secular and you go to art galleries. Yeah.
Well, what makes you think you're secular? And the head turn is real. He does that.
And I thought to myself, what on earth are you talking about, man? Do you think you can't be
an atheist and enjoy art? Now, I've tried my best to understand what he was getting at. And I think
he was trying to basically say that in order to enjoy art, you need to have some kind of value.
And in order to have any kind of surface level value, you can always ask the why that question.
Why do you value this? You know, the classic sort of why do you go to school to get a good grade?
Well, you don't just want the grade. Why do you get the grade? You do it to get a good job and so
on and so forth. Happens with value. And so why do you go? Why do you value art? Because maybe
you value beauty or something. And Peterson's whole thing is that whatever's at the top of
this value hierarchy is in his definition divine. He just defines it as such. And so he essentially
said that people claim that they are nihilists, but they don't live like that. I thought, well,
what would it mean to really live like a nihilist? And I guess I tried to emphasize,
but he's right into the extent that I think most people don't live like they're nihilists.
What would the definition of living like a nihilist be?
I think it would just mean the rejection of any such thing as a non-contingent reason for acting.
Be more accessible. You would need to really think that there's no
reason to do anything outside of essentially your crude preferences in biological drives.
Right. And I think the reason why people think that nihilism is unlivable is because they have
this image of somebody just immediately becoming a Raskolnikov type figure and just committing
a murder or something. But they forget that these people still have their memory and they're going
to be embedded in a culture and an upbringing that their preferences are essentially still going
to be aligned. I mean, Penn Gillette was once asked, if you're an atheist, why don't you kill
and assault every person you want to? And he says, I do. I do kill and assault everybody I want to,
which is precisely nobody. And very clever, I guess a bit of an applause. But the difficult
question, ethically, is what happens when somebody doesn't have that view? What happens when somebody
does just disagree with you? But I don't know. It was kind of boring.
Just to interject that, so you could see the meaning-making machine of society and cultural
norms as being useful to constrain the behavior of those outlier people, the ones who would go out
and commit the litany of mass murders. But you know, mum told me that I'm not supposed to squash
bugs when I was five years old and this is now carried on through. But yeah, I think for most
people, we are the descendants of the people who avoided, at least for the most part, killing
people that were close to us. And we feel a lot of the time like we're now close to each other.
Yes, yes. I think that's probably true. The issue is that the more that we
try to explain away these mechanisms, we try to understand why in our evolutionary history,
we might have evolved certain moral taboos, this kind of stuff. It begins to essentially take the
complete ethical force out of it. And that's what people think leads to leads to nihilism.
Once you have fully explained why something would be considered immoral,
just on evolutionary grounds, you've essentially taken out the moral factor altogether and you're
just explaining it in terms of genetic preference. Yeah, there's no more meaning. There's nothing,
there's no additional fluff or feeling of anything. But this is, you know, I've spent a lot of time
over the last few years talking to evolutionary psychologists, evolutionary biologists, people
that have looked at the evolution of culture as well from a mimetic standpoint too. And
it does seem to me that culture is just like exclusively an adaptive response to coordination
at large scale. And that all of the things that are encoded in that are effective ways for your
tribe to not blow itself up. Would you say the same thing about morality in general?
Yes. So then how do you escape this nihilist conundrum that you think all it is, you know,
the reason why you're not killing people is just because you sort of evolved that way.
Doesn't that kind of take out some of the meaning? So I think if you are permanently self assessing
why you do the things you do and the inputs that you feel, but what that doesn't account for is the
fact that we are self deceptive. And the sense of being a human is one that is imbued with meaning.
I often use this term about how you are not personally cursed as a reassurance. And it was
something that was reassuring to me if I was spending a bit of time where I was feeling
sad or down or whatever, it would feel like whatever emotion I was going through, whatever
unpleasant emotion I was going through was like a personal curse. And this makes sense when you
look back at how the gods were personified as different sorts of emotions, right? That, you
know, keep it had an arrow that hit you or that, you know, you had gods of war, you had gods of
wrath, you had gods of envy, you had gods of narcissism, because the experience of a thing,
of a thought, of an emotion, of a state is not just the confused chemical signals of your body.
And I can just reverse engineer this. Even the interest, the interaction of you and whatever's
going on in the social group around you isn't just that. It's imbued with meaning because you
interpret things in this soup of experience, which scales things up from just what's happening to,
and it feels like there's something, it feels like there's some there there, right?
Yes. Yeah, yeah, you can't escape that illusion if it is an illusion. This is another thing that I
spoke to Ben about first name, first name basis, it seems to me now. Mr. Shapiro.
I did try that in, you know, when I was emailing back and forth about setting up that event,
I went to type out sort of like, well, it would be great to talk to Mr. Shapiro about,
it just didn't feel right, you know, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
At least not behind his back, not to say that I'm rude behind his back, but it felt even weirder
that he wasn't there to sort of appreciate the courtesy. Anyway, he said, like, you know,
that I don't believe in free will, I don't know if you believe in free will,
perhaps we can talk about that. He's like, look, you don't believe in free will,
but you act as if free will does exist all the time. And I remember thinking,
what do you mean? What does it look like to act as though free will doesn't exist?
The very argument or one of the arguments against free will is that you are essentially driven by
your biology or your genes, your will, you know, the Arthur Schopenhauer line that you can do what
you will, you just can't will what you will. In fact, you have to do what you will, that's what
drives behavior. If that's the case, then why do you have this vision in your head that if you
lack a belief in free will, you're like not going to get out of bed in the morning.
The very argument is that you will get out of bed in the morning because you desire to go and get
some breakfast. That's like the whole point. And so any argument of that form where people say,
well, you don't live like that's the case, I was like to think, well, what would it look like to
you then? You know, if I could ask Jordan Peterson when he says the way you don't live
like an atheist, what would that look like to you? I don't know if he might say something like,
well, you'd probably be this morally depraved, you know, self interested, blah, blah, blah,
like maybe, but is that really what you think? I mean, I don't know, but
Yeah, I think it forgets the fact that you are a product of your time, regardless of your beliefs
from that time, right? I understand the Judeo-Christian values that everything is based on,
you know, it's like a common talking point from those guys. But okay, how am I supposed to extricate
me from that completely shake the etch a sketch of my value set and then take it from the beginning?
And let's not forget, like a lot of those values have grown out of what would have been an adaptive
response in any case. So the illusion is there, the illusion is unshakable. And so
it sort of is a bit senseless to me to us, particularly on the free will thing, like,
oh, why don't you act like free will doesn't exist? What, what do you mean? I literally,
it's unintelligible. Did you listen to my Sapolsky episode yet?
No, I don't think so. So his new book determined the science of life without free will.
Every time that I talk about free will, people get upset.
Why is that? That's the question for you. I think the reason
in insert joke about how it's not their fault. It's like my least favorite genre of joke that's
that's done and no free will of my own in philosophy. It's every single time,
every no free will without fail. I don't know. I don't know. And it's something that
the conversation about free will is such a turn off for people that I actively push it
further into episodes. I actively don't title episodes that have got that in it. I can
uh, surreptitiously coax people into thinking about it. But the response is, is very
it's a lot of amount of high amount of dissatisfaction. People don't like to think about that.
Now it may be because it's dry. I'm open to that. That's true. It may be because it threatens their
sense of agency and sovereignty, which is something I've kind of built this
channel off the back of, like you can enact change within your own life,
internalize your locus of control, stop being such a bitch, etc. And so maybe I'm a
like the victim of my own foundation in that regard that I've selected for a particular
group of people. But it's happened a few times, a few different conversations about it tangential.
One guy was a compatibility like quasi-compatibilist.
Are you shaking your head? Why are you shaking your head?
That it's just the most ludicrous compromise to me.
Compatibilism. Am I right in saying that
compatibilism just kicks the can down the road and plays lexical overload with things?
I think more or less. Right.
A lot of the time you're just also dealing with essentially a redefinition of free will.
It's water. I don't mean that. I mean this thing.
Sam Harris has called it the Atlantis fallacy. He had an extended argument with Daniel Dennett,
a compatibilist about free will. And Daniel Dennett would talk about how this exists and
this exists. And it sounds like, yeah, that's true. But you're just not talking about what
people care about in free will. What you're doing is we're trying to ask if Atlantis exists.
And you're pointing to Venice and you're saying, look, here's the city. It's got a lot of water.
And it's kind of old. And these are all true, but it's just not Atlantis.
And what most people are talking about when they try to bring free will back into the
discussion is just not free will. It's as straightforward as it gets in my view.
I mean, there are versions of freedom that can be sensibly believed in.
It kind of depends on what your conception of freedom means. But if you mean something like
authorship over your actions, if you mean that we could have rewound the clock and I could have
done something differently, that I could have won a different shirt. I don't think that the answer is
yes. Logically, yes. The possible world's discussion earlier. There's a possible world
where I'm in a different shirt. But I guess like physically, possibly metaphysically,
I couldn't have made a different choice. It's not possible.
Regardless of what you believe or don't believe about free will,
the response, people's response to it is fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.
And maybe, yeah, maybe it is that degree of control, almost like the denial of death. I wonder,
have they done experiments on when people are reminded that they do or do not have free will,
that their behavior adjusts? Not that I know of, but I would love to see that. Because if it is,
I mean, maybe it is true, but I think if it is true, I can understand why it might be quite
like fatalistic. I mean, it literally is quite fatalistic, really, to say that there's no freedom.
And I can understand why that might make someone sad, and that sadness might motivate their behaviors
slightly differently. But I think that intrinsically, if there are a way to control for people who are
sort of happy or sad about it, because you can believe in there's no free will and be like,
thank goodness, it's all out of my hands. If you can control for that and show that people do,
they are like less productive, or they don't get out of bed as much, then I think that would be
meaningful. And it might be a sort of second order reason not to have this conversation.
I don't know if there's been such an investigation as there has to death, which,
by the way, I think a good example of the death denial thing is to think about your
magnum opus, if you were sort of working on the great life work or something, and you're about
to die, and then you're just about to sort of to finish it off. Suppose you found out that
after you publish this and you die, a week later, you found out that a meteor was going to come
and destroy the earth. Everybody dies. Does that make you more or less enthusiastic about
finishing your project? Now, for most people, I think it's going to make them less enthusiastic.
It would certainly make me less enthusiastic. But why? What's the difference to you?
It doesn't make a difference. You're going to be dead beforehand anyway. Nothing's going to change.
Seems to suggest that maybe the desire to get this done before you die in the first place
isn't just as people like to claim for the love of the art, and it's all in the process. No,
it's because here's a work that's going to outlive you. Here's something that's going to help you
to escape your own death. And when faced with the inevitability of the destruction of even that,
the motivation goes down. I wouldn't be surprised if simply reminding somebody who's writing a play
or something that one day, heat death, everything evaporates, including your new book, if that would
make them less motivated to finish the book, which to me implies that the reverse corollary
is that the reason you are making the book is in some way indebted to the fact that you think it
will outlive you and therefore is an exercise in the denial of death.
Didn't Ernest Becker die at an unfortunate time?
I don't know much about his personal life.
I think he did.
But there are interesting coincidences like that dotted across a lot of... The thing about
coincidences is that so many things happen all the time, that the only extraordinary thing would be
if there weren't some extraordinary things like that. Like Al Becker Mew was killed in a car crash,
and he was killed in a car crash with a train ticket in his pocket. So it seemed like he
decided at the last minute to go in the car and said, and he had previously said that the most
absurd way to die would be in an automobile accident, and that's how he dies.
Sigmund Freud was terrified of... I think it was the number 63. It was like 63, or maybe it was
like 48. I can't remember. It was one of the... A number around that. He was just terrified of it,
had a real sort of foreboding about it for some reason. He got a phone number that ended in
that number, and it freaked him out. He got a hotel room that had that number, and he just became
convinced that he was going to die at that age. Guess when he died? 48. No, when he was like 80.
Sometimes it goes wrong. You're a dick. You are a dick. Rest of that was true, though. All right.
What's your sexy paradox that you wanted to show me? Get your paradox out of the land.
Think about this, right? Now, I can't remember what the source is, and I want to attribute the
person who does it. Maybe I can find it. Yeah, get it. Let me find it, because I want to make sure
that they get the credit for it. I was told about it by a friend. You have to give me a minute,
because I don't want to pass this off as my own. What do you do with everything else?
I think it's called the anthropic. It's a website called risingentropy.com.
It is seemingly the origin of this paradox, but I was told about it by a friend.
And what this does is it shows us that different ways of thinking give us wildly
different answers to the same problem, different ways of looking at a problem.
Imagine that there's a maniac who... And it's called the anthropic dice killer,
if you want to look it up. There's a maniac who is kidnapping people and murdering them.
And what he does is he kidnaps one person, and he blindfolds them, and he rolls a dice.
And if that dice is a six, then he'll kill you. If not, he'll let you go free. And what he'll do,
if he lets you go free, is he'll go and pick up two people, kidnap them, blindfold them,
roll the dice. If it's a six, kills you. If it's anything else, go free. Then it's four people.
Then it's eight people, and it doubles. So it's an exponential... Until he hits a six.
Until he hits a six. Now, you wake up knowing all this information, you wake up blindfolded,
and you know these facts, and you know that a dice is about to be rolled, but you're blindfolded,
you don't know how many people are there with you. You're given a button that you can press
that will make the chances that you're killed half, one and two. So if you want to,
you can press this button, and a 50% of the time, it will just kill you immediately,
and 50% of the time, you'll get to go free. Or you can let him roll the dice.
Okay. What do you do? Do you press the button or not?
So, at least on the surface, this is to do with the probability of one in six versus one in two.
But there is this escalating thing that's happening in the background. So I would presume
that you would say, don't hit the button, because that has increased the chance of you being killed
from one in six to one in two, which is great. Right. And this seems true, and it is true.
Yeah, I mean, you've got a one in six chance of dying, and if you press the button,
you've got a one in two. So you're better off rolling the dice. But if you think about it
as one big block, then something very strange happens, because if you consider all of the
people involved, if all you know is that you've woken up and you're somewhere in this process,
then, interestingly, like, let's say it gets to number two, it gets to around two,
then there have been three people involved, three victims involved.
The first one and then the second two.
And two of them end up dying, and one of them goes free. So if you find yourself in this situation
as a victim, you've got a more than half probability that you're in the second group
that ends up dying. I suppose that actually it ends in the third group.
Right. Now there are how many people involved? You've got one, then two,
then four. So we've now got seven people involved,
right? And four people end up dying. And so if you sort of wake up in this scenario,
you've got a four in seven chance that you're going to die, that you're going to be one of
the people who dies, which is more than half. And this continues, such that if you consider
the fact that it doesn't matter where it ends, you're always going to have a slightly higher
than half chance that you're in the group that ends up getting killed.
But is it more than half given that each round of the dice roll is only one in six?
Yeah. Because it's about like, if in fact it gets to number three,
like you know that there's a more than half chance that you're going to be in the group
that dies. If it in fact gets to number two, then there's a more than half chance that you're
going to die. If it in fact gets number four. So I'm going to hit the button. Is that right?
Well, maybe. I mean, it seems ludicrous to hit the button, but thinking about it this way,
it seems like that's what you should actually do. It's simultaneously the case that you have
got a one in six chance of dying because you're doing it on the roll of a dice.
But at the same time, if you think about the fact that one of these groups is going to end
up dying, and it doesn't matter where it ends, the chances of you being in that group are always
going to be slightly higher than half. Right. From a population level.
It's why it's the anthropic dice killer, because it's the anthropic principle it's
thinking about. Yeah. What's that? I once read a sci-fi book that was,
there was a threat of the end of the world. They were looking to get humanity off the planet.
And there is a theory that uses almost this exact same idea, which says that
if you take the entirety of human history, and you were to pick a time at which you were to live,
and you have this rapid increase toward humanity, it works out that it's more likely
that you are within some percent of the end of humanity. Right. Yeah.
Because of the exponential growth. Precisely. Exactly. Are you familiar with this idea?
I don't think so. Right. But it's fascinating. It works the exact same. Yeah.
As long as that graph is going up at the requisite speed, then yeah. Right. And this is the exact
same thing. I mean, the version on the website actually involves snake eyes. So it's two dice,
and instead of it being one, then two, then four, it's one, then ten, then a hundred, then a thousand.
Right. Yeah. So it ramps up more quickly. And now you're rolling snake eyes. So it's a one and
thirty-six chance. And it turns out that if you add up the probability of like, you know,
n number of cases, it's something like a 90% chance versus the half that you get to press,
which just seems ludicrous. And it seems that two things are true at once, depending on just
how you look at the problem. So sometimes problems like this are just to do with the
way you word them. I mean, there are tons of like these sort of interesting maths paradoxes,
which aren't paradoxes at all. You must be familiar with the man who walks into the hotel,
pays 30 pounds, goes up to his room, and the bellboy says, or the guy behind the bar says,
the manager says, oh, no, he should have only paid 25. We've got a deal on. So he calls the
bellboy and says, can you go and give him five pounds back to the man in the room? And the
bellboy thinks to himself on the way up, like, this guy doesn't know any better. He doesn't
know how much he owed. I'm going to pocket three pounds for myself. I'm only going to give him
two pounds. So he goes back to the room. He says, excuse me, sir, sorry, you paid, you know,
you paid 30 pounds, you paid too much. Here's two pounds change. So how much has the man now paid?
25 pounds. No, 28 pounds. 28 pounds. And how much has the bellboy got in his pocket?
Two. He gave the guy two pounds back. Right. Where's that money come from?
Yeah, he's got three. So the bellboy, so the man's now only paid 28 pounds. He's paid 30 pounds.
He gets two pounds back from the bellboy. He's got, he's paid 28 pounds. The bellboy's got three
pounds in his pocket, which makes 31. So where's the extra pound come from?
Actually, no, he hasn't. The guy paid 25 plus now he's got two back.
That's right. So it's the way you word it, right? So this like stumps people. And you can do it
the other way around as well. You can say that the guy goes up and he gives, the bellboy gives
three pounds back to the guy. So he's only paid 27 pounds, but the bellboy's got, he's got two
pounds. And it's only 29. And this, you know, it sort of goes viral on social media because
people are like, how the hell does it work? It's the blue and black or green and gold dress.
It's like, I mean, for those that, yeah, I guess there is, it's like those in that there is a
real answer to what the actual war is actually going on there. I mean, these people based on
how you, how you word it, it's how people, you know, short change it when, when they, when they
scan people at a, at a bar or something. I mean, the easiest way to, to visualize that particular
problem is to imagine that the man was only supposed to pay two pounds. You know, so the
bellboy goes up and gives him 28. He's supposed to give him 28 pounds and decides to pocket two
pounds for himself. So he gives him, you know, gives him 26 pounds back. So how much has the man
paid? Like four pounds and how much the bellboy got? Like 26 pounds, which is ludicrous. But
you'd be amazed at how easily people can be completely nicely stumped by it.
And it's all in the, it's all in the wording. So a problem like the anthropic dice killer,
I wonder how much it's just sort of to do with the, the way that you describe it, you know.
Have there been any paradoxes that sent you into a fugue state for a little while? Was there
anything that captured a particularly long amount of time that you sort of couldn't stop considering?
Well, most of the famous ones since, since I first started learning about paradoxes,
like the famous Monty Hall problem that, that, that obsessed me for, well, I wouldn't say obsessed
me, but I was, I was sort of blown away by it. There's also, you know, the Monty Hall problem,
that you'll definitely have heard of this before, this, it's, it's the game show and the three doors.
Right. Yeah. You know, right. There are interesting paradoxes that aren't actually
paradoxes. There's a, there's a book by Jim Alcalely called paradox, which is a description of
so-called paradoxes. So like, I think, I think all this paradox is when people used to think that
the universe was infinite, infinitely large, I mean, there was this problem that if, if empty
space is filled up fairly randomly with stars, I mean, we know there's a lot of stars in the sky
and, and galaxies and objects that emit light, then there should essentially be no darkness
in the sky. The sky should look kind of like an overcast day, because like the, the, the gaps in
the sky, you know, are all going to build up and, and, and, and any amount, any small gap,
you might think the stars are really far away. They'll also be like closer together, therefore
emitting more light visually and they'll be bigger. And so if the universe is infinite,
you should just see a sort of overcast day and it was a paradox. It was like, how does this,
how does this happen? And it basically became an interesting proof that the universe has a
beginning, that the universe is not in fact infinite, just the fact that it gets dark at night,
because if it were actually infinite, there should be a sort of overcast view,
Alba's paradox. And like I say, it's sort of a paradox, but not really a paradox.
Did you familiar with the Buetes void? Do you know this?
I think so.
So this is like my favorite part of the universe. I'd say like, I'm mapping it,
like my favorite barbecue restaurants in Austin. And it's a huge, what's, what's referred to as a
super void, which is a period of the universe, an area of the universe, which has way fewer
galaxies than you would anticipate. And given what's the principle of like homogeneity across
the universe that it should be, it should be relatively similar, right?
Like thermodynamics. Yes, that it should entropy and
you just know you're just saying the space words at me.
Well, you know, like when you spray and spray in aerosol can, and it will eventually dissipates
equally. So the point is that there shouldn't be huge fluctuations in the way that we see
the universe. Everything should be spread relatively evenly. Now I found out that
that supposedly at the point of the Big Bang, there were one million
particles of antimatter and one million and one particles of matter. And it is that one to one
million and one ratio that is exactly where everything that we see comes from. And this
minor imbalance is actually what's permitted everything to exist. But this particular Buetes
B001 with an umlaut TES, Buetes supervoid, it's just super fucking interesting. It's this gap
where there's way fewer galaxies than there should be. And why should this exist? Given that we've
got this sort of principle of homogeneity across the universe. And that's one of my favorite things
to like learn about. Yeah, it's, but is it, is it that we know about this void because of the
disbalance or is it that we hypothesize the disbalance because of the knowledge of the void?
We know based on mapping of, I think, I'm not sure if it's telescopic or if it's microwave
background stuff, but we know that it's there. Right. And the question is, what the fuck is
this thing doing that? Yeah, well, that's a bit like sort of dark energy when we discover that
galaxies are spinning a little bit too quickly on the outside. There seems to be something like
pushing them along. What do you make of the fine tune universe idea? A lot of people describe it
as the most powerful argument for God's existence. Christopher Hitchens in the back of a car once
said that that was really what gave him pause. I don't find that it moves me very much. I mean,
it does seem quite extraordinary that had any of the constants of the universe,
the force of gravity, for example, if it was stronger or weaker by the most unimaginably small
amount, then it would either be strong enough that the universe would collapse in on itself,
or it would be so weak that atoms couldn't even form, or at least objects couldn't form,
and everything just gets blown apart at the big bang. Three explanations for this, it's chance,
it's necessity, or it's design, and chances seems like a ludicrous suggestion. I mean,
there are lots of different constants, and it may be the case that we discover this sort of theory
of everything that reduces it down to one. Still a huge mystery as to why it has the
the constant that it does, but would mean that we're not talking about lots of different
constants in harmony. Somehow happens to be unified in one way.
The idea of it necessarily being that way doesn't seem that out of the question for me.
People put it in the language of saying that had the constants been different by this amount,
the universe couldn't exist, and what people often hear is the chances of the constant being,
as it was, was the same number, but I don't think that's the same thing.
It might just be not possible that it could have had a different value.
Mason What's the observer selection effect of this?
Mason This doesn't work for the fine-tuning argument,
I think. The so-called anthropic principle, the universe seems designed for human life.
People might point to, for example, the Earth's perfect distance from the Sun in the so-called
Goldilocks zone, had it been a little bit further out or a little bit closer, humans couldn't exist.
The easy answer to that is to say, well, yeah, but if you didn't exist, then you wouldn't be
there to observe that it didn't exist. Given the size of the universe, life might develop
somewhere, possibly in multiple places, and the places where it's going to be observed
coming about is where it comes about, so no surprise. That works there, but the fine-tuning
constants of the universe, we're not talking about a potential billions of
Earths that could all give rise to human beings. We're talking about if one of these constants
was different, but the tiniest amount, nothing exists. Sure, it is still true that didn't not
happen. My friend, Josh Parikh, has given me an example in the past of, I don't know,
you can imagine a series of highly trained knife throwers just lobbed 100,000 knives at you
in an attempt to kill you, and they all miss perfectly cutting out the silhouette of your
body behind you, absolutely perfectly, just like uncanny. Someone says, well, they must have done
that on purpose. It's like a trick, right? And you say, no, no, no, I think it's just happened
by chance. You say, well, that's ludicrous. What if it didn't? And I wouldn't be here to
observe that it did, would I? It still just wouldn't do it for you. Even though that is true,
had you been killed, you wouldn't be there to observe it. It just seems such an unlikely
coincidence that that just doesn't work for the, when we're talking about the actual fundamental
stuff of the universe, which is why people are so troubled by it. But I do think,
generally speaking, with all of these kinds of things, fine-tuning, consciousness is another
example that's broadly in the scientific realm that people think like this just can't be explained
of that reference to a God. Maybe they're right. I don't know. But if you intuitively were to step
into a time machine and look at some people having this conversation, and you said, imagine them
looking back and saying, gosh, can you believe it? They hadn't worked out fine-tuning yet.
They hadn't figured out the constants. They hadn't figured out the science of consciousness yet.
I can conceive of that. Just intuitively, I can see someone doing that. But when I think about
my arguments for atheism, the problem of evil, divine hiddenness, this kind of stuff, I can't
imagine somebody looking through a time machine similarly, had a conversation that I have and
going, gosh, can you believe it? They hadn't worked out the problem of evil yet. They hadn't
worked out divine hiddenness yet. I think these are perennial problems. So where you have these
scientific arguments for the existence of God, I guess I just have more of a trust that they will
one day be explained in a way that won't require recourse to a divine author in a way that my
criticisms of religion will probably not be similarly resolved.
We had a great conversation in Austin, as you explained to me about the potential historical
accuracy or inaccuracy of Jesus' resurrection. Can you go through that a little bit?
Yeah. I mean, this sometimes is used as an argument for the existence of God, but I think more
successfully is used once you've already established the existence of God to try to
establish the truth of Christianity. And that is a bunch of historical facts surrounding Jesus'
alleged resurrection that you sort of have to ask what the best explanation is for. Now,
you can't historically prove a resurrection, but you can historically prove events and then ask
what the best explanation of those facts is. So people will often point to the fact that
there was a man called Jesus walking around morally teaching people who was crucified by the
Romans and that a few days after his death was seen, people made claims that they'd seen him
after he'd died. And the question is, how do you explain these facts?
The gospel reliability is an interesting question in general, and people will often on the surface
level say, look, the Bible contradicts itself. It's full of contradictions. And there are some
seeming contradictions in the gospel stories. But of course, what a lot of people neglect to
consider is that when we're talking about a text as a historical document, contradictions
shouldn't make us think that it's less accurate, but more accurate. If historical sources contradict
each other, that's evidence of their accuracy rather than evidence of the opposite. Because
if this is a mythical story that somebody's making up, you would expect the details
to concur. That is, if you're questioning two suspects in some kind of murder trial or something,
and their stories match up perfectly, like to the T, the timings, everything, it arouses suspicion.
It seems like somebody's inventing something. Someone's coming up with a story here and trying
to perfect it. Now, people have this idea that a bunch of people got together and tried to fool
the world into this mythical story of this man rising from the dead. Do you think they would
have made the mistake of just including these blatant contradictions? I don't know. In other
words, I think if somebody was making it up, they probably would have taken more care.
Is there a term for this? I'm sure there is. I'm not a historian. I couldn't tell you what it is.
But we do see contradictions on the minor points. We don't really see much disagreement
about the major points. I mean, there is some enough disagreement that I think to arouse
suspicion. I'm saying this as if I'm some kind of Christian or theist. I sort of put on that hat
when I'm asked to have a conversation of this kind. I mean, it does seem to me suspicious,
for example, that the Gospel of Mark, which is the earliest Gospel,
contains no post-resurrection appearances. And then the Gospel of Matthew does include
post-resurrection appearances. The Gospel of Luke includes even more. It's only in the Gospel of
John that we get, for instance, doubting Thomas, which is the latest gospel, canonical Gospel,
I should say. That's where that arises. And in fact, the story of doubting Thomas famously,
he doesn't believe that it's the risen Christ. And Jesus has come and touched my wounds.
And he touches his wounds, and he says, my Lord and my God. And Jesus says,
you believe because you've seen. Blessed are those who believe without seeing.
So in my view, what we have is this so-called mythological development of no post-resurrection
appearances. And as the time goes on, as we get further away from the source, the stories get
more fantastical, ending in a moral lesson to believe without seeing. This to me does seem
a little bit suspicious. So it is a fascinating mystery. Something very strange happened on
Easter morning, because how do we explain the fact that this man gets crucified by the Romans,
and then people claim to see him after he died? And were willing to be put to death for that belief?
Now, okay, maybe he didn't die. Unlikely, as they say, the Romans knew how to kill people.
And supposedly, they check, and they go to break the legs of the other prisoners as they're taking
them down from their crosses. They're taking them down temporarily, and they hadn't died yet. But
when they go to break Jesus' legs, they realize he's already dead, which is why his legs don't
get broken. And they stab him in the side with a stick to make sure that he's dead. I mean,
this was a very effective method of killing people, and they knew how to do it. So it's
unlikely that he just somehow survived this. Is that the guy that stabbed him with the spear,
and supposedly, there's blood on the spear? Or did he get stabbed?
Someone stabbed him with the spear after he's on the cross. And it's essentially to check
he's dead. Okay, so likelihood is that he was actually crucified. And then a few days later,
people are claiming to see him. Maybe they're lying. But then you don't tend to go to death
for something you know to be a lie. You're willing to be put to death for things that you think are
true that are false. But very rarely are people willing to die for beliefs that they don't actually
believe themselves. That doesn't really happen. So they probably weren't lying. As maybe they were
maybe they were mistaken, fooled. Yeah, now, I've known you since about 2019, which
is probably, it will have been slightly longer than Jesus was with his disciples. But imagine
spending every single day with this person, living with this person, eating with this person.
And then you've only seen him a few days ago. And somehow, imagine somebody managed to convince
you that they were me. Even if I had a twin brother, they probably wouldn't be able to convince
you that it was me. Or maybe they were hallucinating in groups. One of the earliest
Gospel, New Testament sources is the letters of Paul, the earliest. And in one of those letters,
Paul refers to Jesus having appeared to 500 people at once. And in some of the Gospels,
you get at least some group appearances, at least more than one person. And sometimes,
groups of disciples, the 12 all seeing Jesus all at once, you don't get group hallucinations like
that. And so it doesn't seem like they were mistaken either. And so if they're not mistaken,
they're not making it up. What explains the fact that these people claim to see him after he had
died? And the Christian apologists will say that the only real plausible explanation is that he
really did rise from the dead. Now, it's an interesting argument, and it's quite powerful.
However, my response has always been that this sort of process of elimination is very clever,
and that's how it's usually run. But it can go the other way. I mean, imagine I were trying to
prove that there was such thing as a group hallucination. I know it's extraordinary,
but there was a group hallucination. And I tried to prove it by saying, well, what are the other
explanations? Or maybe they lied. Well, they wouldn't do that because they wouldn't go to death.
Or maybe a man rose from the dead, but come on, that doesn't happen. That breaks all the laws
of physics. So the only remaining option is this. It kind of depends where you start.
But it is weird. Something very strange seems to have happened on that morning.
I can see why philosophers go mad, because you're able to simultaneously convince yourself
of something and then convince yourself of the opposite and then convince yourself of everything
that you've believed. I think one of those famous quotes of Socrates is that the sign of wisdom in
a man or something is the ability to entertain a belief without holding it or without becoming
convinced by it or something like that. And I think it's something anybody can do if they want to.
And it's why philosophers think that philosophers are better at doing this. I don't think that's
true. I think they're just talking about stuff that's far less political, far less real. And so
they're less likely to get, they're less likely to be offended at the prospect of considering
the falsehood of their beliefs until you get into a relation.
You definitely seem to be able to have an ability to drop into and out of arguments on both sides
of the same fence and play with ideas in a way that I think is rare and presumably
a bit of a disposition, but also largely trained, because you can sit and convince chat GPT
that God exists or try and turn me into a theist and then stand on stage and do the exact opposite.
I think that there's probably quite a lot to learn from how
people who have spent a good bit of time playing with ideas in philosophy
dispassionately have that separation between themselves and the idea and the belief and
what it means to them and the emotion and kind of that whole ambient mess.
Yeah. Well, it's playing is a good word because it's fun. It's enjoyable.
And that's why it's fun to talk about theory of knowledge because who really cares?
It doesn't grow corn, as they say, or make corn, however you are supposed to say it.
And that's fine because if it did, then it would certainly all get a bit serious
and it kind of really matters whether you get it right or wrong. Whereas here, we're just sort of
having fun, but I don't know. I can kind of see why
heretics would get burnt at the stake when religion had social power because
you become convinced that this is the source of meaning, this is the source of truth,
without it, we are nothing. It's now being threatened.
And then it turns out that maybe there are actually some holes to poke here.
But what are you going to do? I mean, you can't let them do that because this is literally
societally calamitous. And so they end up getting burnt at the stake.
That's what also annoys me. I mean, you mentioned earlier this recent resurgence
in the idea that, oh, we're all sort of balancing on Judeo-Christian values,
maybe kind of true in a sense, but it does kind of get on my nerves that after,
I said this to Ben yesterday, the history of religious persecution against the very
developments that those religious groups now like to claim as their own.
I think the religion has shown to be wrong on a number of things. I listed them yesterday,
the position of women in society, the fate of homosexuals, at least practicing homosexuals,
the position of the earth in relation to the sun, the age of both of those celestial bodies,
wrong about the common evolutionary ancestry of all animals, including the human animal,
wrong about the ownership of other human beings as private property, as it's explicitly
condoned not only in the Old Testament, but also in the new. And now, not only does
religion sort of, I mean, religion fails to come to us with an apology and contrition and say,
maybe we were wrong. It says, no, no, no, those things are ours all along. It says, yes,
we may have shown the instruments of torture to Galileo because he suggested that the earth
might orbit the sun rather than the other way around. But hey, didn't you know that the
scientific revolution is essentially Judeo-Christian in origin? Yes, the Old Testament gives you
explicit instructions about exactly how to either buy or steal other human beings and keep them
sometimes as your sexual property. But don't you know that the abolitionist movement is essentially
Judeo-Christian in origin? Yes, I know that St. Paul says that man is the glory of God,
but woman is the glory of man, and that I suffer not a woman to teach nor to assert authority
over a man, rather she should remain silent for Adam was formed first, then Eve. But don't you know
that social justice movements are essentially Judeo-Christian in origin? Yes, we know about
the stoning of homosexuals and the fact that even St. Paul says that they're not getting into heaven,
but don't you know that the LGBT movement is essentially sort of riding on Judeo-Christian
principles? It seems to me relatively offensive to the people who've managed to secure these
developments against the very religious traditions that now like to claim them as their own.
Yeah, both cause and effect, it's like being punched in the face by somebody who then comes
over and gives you a bandage for it. I'm sort of rehashing some of the stuff that I said yesterday
here. People like to point out that the people who really got the scientific revolution going or
often believe as in God, Galileo believed in God, Newton believed in God, in fact Newton spent,
but people were fascinated to discover his diaries to find that he spent more time writing about
theology than science. Mad man for the last 30 years doing alchemy, right? Right. But here's the
thing, as I said yesterday, I don't claim that this is the case, but if it were true that science
had undermined religion and Christianity, if it were the case that actually these things aren't
compatible with each other, then when somebody says, well, that can't be the case because don't
you know that the people who sort of founded the scientific revolution were religious? Well,
what else would they have been if they hadn't yet invented the mechanism by which
their beliefs would come to be undermined? It's like saying that it's amazing that the person
who invented the motor car didn't own a motor car beforehand. You see what I'm saying? It's sort of,
I don't know, it seems very strange to me and it's very recently that the popularity of this has
increased as you say. I mean, you go back to the to the mid-naughties at the height of new atheism
and it was very popular to talk about how religion's sort of always getting in the way of science
and maybe that was a bit crude, but I think we're seeing an equally crude annexation of
all of the beneficial social developments of the past hundred years as somehow necessarily
standing upon the Judeo-Christian tradition as if it couldn't have happened without them.
Is this a scrabbling for something to hold on to given that the collapse of grand narratives has
had some poor externalities over the last couple of years? Is it just mass cope?
I think so. I think that nihilism as it were carries with it the feeling of being naked.
You sort of thrown off what were essentially optional clothes to reveal what was there all
along, but when you actually face it to nature, it's embarrassing, it's scary and you will do
anything you can if you find yourself naked in public to find any clothes to put on,
not just your old ones. It doesn't matter what clothes, any clothes are better than no clothes
and this is what people are beginning to realize and so they're scrambling for their old clothes
again. Trying to legitimate. Yes, and trying to put them on and that's why it's easy as well
for people to go around poking holes in other people's clothes. It's very easy to do, but
that's what the success of a movement like New Atheism consists in, in the fact that all they
had to do was just tell other people why they're wrong. You only need to poke holes in other
people's clothes, but if you need to sew your own shirt, that gets a little more difficult.
Yes, Lewis said that the purpose of philosophy is not the cutting down of forests, but the
irrigation of deserts. That's very interesting. Yeah, I've thought about this for a good while.
The seductiveness of being critic as opposed to being somebody that makes suggestions
and the lack of preparedness of anybody to put forward any proposals for anything.
It's easy for both sides to accuse each other of being reactionary. The reactionary right,
the reactionary left and ultimately, for instance, perfect example of this is
in the world of dating and sort of mate selection in the mating market,
everybody can provide criticisms about what's going wrong and almost nobody provides any
actionable steps to improve it beyond something that is eliminative rather than additive, right?
Like, well, if we could just stop doing this, then this would be fixed. It's like, I don't think
that that's quite the way that it works. And there's another very unique protection mechanism
that's given, which is it's very hard to criticize someone's criticism or at least
being a critic leaves you open to criticism way less than being a proposer, right? If I put
something forward, if I posit a potential solution for you to be able to come back and say, well,
this is shit and this is shit and this is shit, it's very easy to do. Whereas for you to say,
for me to critic what you did and then for you to come back and go, well, actually this and this
and this, but it's like, it kind of gets all a little bit abstract and it's a few degrees removed
from anything that feels real. Yeah, Simon Cowell can't write a song. You know, like if the world
was full of Simon Cowell, so we'd end up with no music. Somebody's got to do the building here.
You can't just be a critic. And this is what I think has been the reason for the success of the
sort of anti-New Atheists stuff that we've been seeing recently. I mean, you'll have seen this,
even the New Atheists themselves sort of treat it like it's a dead animal. And in many ways,
it is. And I think it's got to do with the fact that, yeah, they've done a very good job of cutting
down the central pillar of what has traditionally been the reason for people getting out of bed
in the morning. And then when people are there saying, well, what do we put in its place? They're
like, see ya. You know, I'm out. And they go off and do different things. And what are people to do?
And that's why...
Was it the job of the New Atheists to provide something to...?
Well, maybe not. Some people are just good at diagnosing problems. Karl Marx is a good example.
Karl Marx's diagnoses of the way the world works are fascinating to read and incredibly useful,
even if you disagree with them. But obviously, attempts to sort of build societies on those
ideas alone have failed. Seems like you need something a little bit more. I just don't think
it's true, the religion stuff, I mean. And so that's why I think we're seeing this because
people are beginning to realise that it probably isn't true. They can't quite get behind the
truth claims. But they recognise that there's some utility in having other people believe
that it is true. And I don't know where that leaves us because in this discussion about whether
religion is good or bad for society, I said yesterday, look, I will accept your premise wholesale
that religion is good, maybe even necessary for society. What do you want me to do if I just
don't think it's true? I might just lie to my children, raise them believing something that I
don't believe is the case, because I think it will somehow be beneficial to society.
I don't think it works like that. I don't think people can actually fool themselves. Sure,
you can act as if God exists. And that's what someone like Peterson says that people do already.
But ultimately, if you just say, well, I think that it should just act like a Christian because
it's good for me. Then when push comes to shove and you really have to make a moral sacrifice,
if you're not actually a Christian, you're probably not going to do the actually Christian thing.
Well, I wonder whether this is afforded to people because of the convenience and comfort of modern
life, the fact that having to really, really put something on the line, it's mostly lapping as
belief systems, and I'll pick up that piece of trash and I will give money to this person on the
street. Yeah, people have sort of forgotten. It's like bourgeois, just believe. So irregularly that
we have to make genuine moral sacrifices of the kind that used to be commonplace throughout the
history of humanity that we've sort of forgotten our ability to do so. And I think that if you push
people now, they recognize that they probably wouldn't make those sacrifices. Did you see the
Mr. Beast poll where he asked, would you rather have like a million dollars or like a random person
on earth dies or something like that if you press this button? And I think it might have been a
majority of people that's slim majority said they'd press that button. Yeah, kill someone random,
I'll take a million bucks. And I actually kind of believe them. I think they actually would. And
people want to say that that's because we've lost our belief in God.
I don't know. Maybe I think a better explanation is just that, like you say, we've become too
comfortable. And so when somebody says in other words like, oh, well, this must be due to decline
in religion. And the fact that we've forgotten our Judeo-Christian heritage. I mean, you'll probably
hear that a lot from people that you might talk to on this podcast. They'll say something like that,
just think to yourself like, is that really the best explanation? Is that the only explanation?
Could it be something to do with the growth of technology? Could it do it? Could it be to do
with something as something to do with the growth of comfort? And is it more likely to do with that?
And maybe it's not the lack of religion that's causing the other stuff, but this other source
that's causing both of those things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot recently about stuff that is
literally true, but figuratively false. And figuratively true, but literally false. And
it kind of seems a little bit like the beliefs that you're talking about here. It may be
comforting, increasing in happiness, adaptive to kind of act as if these things exist.
The belief in free will, actually, believing in free will, or sorry, determinism generally
is something that may be literally true, but figuratively false. And that's kind of where
I've come to as an opinion with this, that largely it's through designed ignorance,
that I just don't think about it that much. Precisely the reason it evolves,
that that's why it exists as an illusion, because it does something for us. And that's fine. I've
never had a problem saying that, but when the sort of auspices under which I'm having a conversation
with Ben Shapiro is that he made a video called The Atheist Illusion. And in that video, he says,
look, you can't have free will without God. I say, yeah, I agree. You can't have free will
without God. You just also can't have it with God. And he essentially says, well, you know,
there's sort of a, I don't know how free will works, but it's sort of a mystery that I'm willing to
accept wholesale. And I'm like, well, this is fine, but who's the delusory one here? You know what I
mean? Like, I've got no problem with you saying like, well, I see that this is more Ben Shapiro,
by the way, but I have no problem with somebody saying, well, yeah, I mean,
maybe free will doesn't exist, but it's better to act as though it does. It's like, okay, fine,
but then don't, don't say that I'm the one acting under a delusion. I mean, delusions can be good.
They might evolve for a good reason, but, but I don't know. I guess I find it difficult to treat
something as true that isn't. It's a bit like the gun is always loaded. That's one of Brett
Weinstein's example, examples. It's not true that the gun is always loaded, but we're just
going to pretend that it is. And that's much better, at least to a good society.
Literally false, but figuratively true. But
like, you can't actually act like it's true. Like if you ask me to put money on, like opening the
gun and seeing if there's a bullet in that. You can behave in a way that functions as if it were.
But then when push comes to shove and you really need to make a decision, you're not going to be
able to do it unless you really believe it's true. So this only works in low stakes situations.
Exactly. Yeah. So, you know, it's all too easy to say, oh, you know, we,
we're just, we're just sort of actors, though it's true. Good example here, using the,
using the acting as if the gun is loaded thing. You do not point it at anybody. You do not leave
it around the children. You do not do the rest of it. If a robber breaks into your house, you
don't go downstairs with said gun acting as if it's loaded. Exactly. Exactly right. And so the
moment that it actually really matters, like in the prior case, it only matters when it goes wrong,
right? But when it begins to matter, when it goes right, and that it goes right,
this principle just doesn't work. And so I'm, I'm suspicious of its efficacy. In other words,
I think we might need to actually start acting in accordance with what's true,
which by the way, is what people have been saying for a long time. Now, oh,
why don't we all just act in accordance with what's true? And then suddenly,
when you begin to realize that maybe free will doesn't exist, maybe morality is just a social
adaptation. Suddenly, this idea of acting in accordance with what's true is, is a, as a point
of principle goes out the window. And it's amazing how I sort of see deontologists,
virtue ethicists transform for my very eyes into utilitarians,
outgoes the principle of live in accordance with the truth, outgo the principles of honesty,
and sort of lack of intentional self-deception. Because, well, we want the greatest good for
the greatest number. A better, more functional society comes about if we just pretend as though
this is the case. What happened to the virtue? What happened to the principle? What happened to
the deontological ethics? It's just out the window all of a sudden. I think sometimes people like
to have their cake and eat it too in that respect. I like to act in accordance with what I think is
true. And when somebody challenges me and says, well, you don't act as though you don't have free
will, I just don't know what that means. I don't know what that looks like. It probably looks
something like this. Alex O'Connor, ladies and gentlemen, Alex, it's been a while since I've
had you on. I think I'm going to be joining you on your show at some point soon. What can people
expect of you over the next couple of months? What's coming up? Hopefully that conversation
with Ben Shapiro, which I'll mention for a 16 billionth time, will be out. I've got a few
debates coming up, Oxford Union, Durham Union, something at Cambridge on the monarchy.
You're being known for the, Piers Morgan's propelled you, catapulted you to the forefront of
the anti-monarchists. Yeah, I'm becoming something of a royal correspondent for that news channel,
an anti-royal correspondent. Hey, my Twitter bio is growing by the minute on this forecast.
Where should people go if they want to keep up to date with the stuff you do?
Just type in my name, Alex O'Connor. I am technically still Cosmic Skeptic.
That's my old handle. I tend to go by my Christian name now, but the handles are still there,
so you'll still find me that way too. Alex, I appreciate you. Thank you, mate.
Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that episode, you will love my full-length
two-hour-long podcast with Douglas Murray. Go on. Press it.
