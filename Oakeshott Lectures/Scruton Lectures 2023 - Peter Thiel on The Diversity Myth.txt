Thank you all very much for coming to this notable event.
It's my honor as well as my pleasure to very briefly introduce the lecture we're going
to have from Peter Thiel and to then be in conversation with him after that presentation.
I should say that Peter to me is interesting as one of the most deeply reflective thinkers
of our time and also in some respects one of the most prophetic in 1993 he published
a book The Diversity Myth on Trends in Academic Thought based on his experiences in Stanford
which aside from a few minor changes in vocabulary is as fresh today as it was then or indeed
fresher because much of what he has written about has come to pass since that time.
But I think what's distinctive and important for me and I believe Peter will talk about
it tonight is the way in which he tries to dig into the deeper causes and sources and
roots of present intellectual and cultural as well as economic and political trends
and to unstick our thinking because to unfix it because just as this book I think illustrates
we've not moved on we live in a perpetual groundhog day in terms of discourse and political thinking
in my smaller way I found that myself I'm still sometimes writing what I wrote in 1989
not simply because I'm not very original but also because it still seems true or sometimes
truer so I think to dig into this as deeply as Peter does is very very rare or unique
and so I myself am enormously looking forward to hearing what he has to say tonight and
also to talking with him after he said it. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. It's a tremendous honor to be here this afternoon. I was involved in a
lot of these culture wars, campus wars in the late 1980s, early 1990s at Stanford University.
I started one of these alternative conservative newspapers and a lot of these debates had
they have a quality of these various crazy campus hijinks that then at the same time
occasionally would escalate into things that might be of some larger or even cosmic importance.
One of the one of the Stanford debates that really got was was pivotal in the late 1980s
involved a debate around the core Western civilization class Western culture. It was a
protest in 1987 where the chant of the protest was hey hey ho ho Western cultures got to go
and it was in one sense about this year-long freshman class you know on another level of
course it was about a repudiation of the of the entire civilization that was being
studied in that class something somewhat more cosmic and then you know I covered a lot of these
things and then a friend I ended up writing a book The Diversity a few years later and
I'll start by reading an excerpt from that and then I want to give a little bit of a sort of
retrospective of you know where I was right where I was wrong where I was not even wrong.
And so we you know we one of the one of the books that replaced Shakespeare was a book by
Emma CÃ©saire A Tempest replaces The Tempest and it's all sort of this inverted anti-colonial
hierarchy where Caliban is a revolutionary hero Prospero is an evil colonialist and so
the the final indignant trade by Caliban and A Tempest. Understand what I say Prospero for years
I bowed my head for years I took it all of it your insults your ingratitude and worst of all
more degrading than all the rest your condescension but now it's over over do you hear of course at
the moment you're still stronger than I am but I don't give a damn for your power or for your dogs
or your police or your inventions and do you know why it's because I know I'll get you and you lied
to me so much about the world about yourself that you ended up by imposing it on me an image of
myself underdeveloping your words incompetent that's how you made me see myself and I loathe
that image and it's false and I know that one day my bare fist just that will be enough to crush
your world the old world is falling apart and by the way you have a chance to get it over with
you can fuck off you can go back to Europe but in a pig's eye you will I'm sure you won't leave
you make me laugh with your mission your vocation your vocation is to give me shit and that's why
you'll stay just like those guys who founded the colonies and who now can't live anywhere else
you're just an old colonial addict that's what you are and and then you know this this goes on
for 250 pages where we go through things like this and and sort of the you know the somewhat
pretentious idea that David and I had in writing this book was we're speaking truth to power that
all that it took was to to sort of expose this and then you can ask questions well is this is this new
is this an improved version of Shakespeare or should one prefer the original is this really
about multiculturalism and non-western cultures or is it just all sort of an anti-western
thing that drives it and and you know and then there were parts of it that felt a little bit
contrived at the time where you know we had we had to somehow make it relevant to the larger
thing and so we had we had the sort of somewhat contrived construction where ideas have consequences
and what happens in the university will eventually will eventually spread beyond it and then of
course when you fast forward 30 years there they're all these ways you know a lot of this has
held up quite well and of course there also are ways where it feels like it didn't matter at all
and so you know I don't know I can I can I can I can brag that the book was prophetic and that a
lot of it came true and then I can say that that somehow the all this effort in in writing this
seemingly did not really matter and that on some level it was not about the logic of the ideas
at all and and what I want to you know reflect about is and so even though I think the specific
arguments I would still defend is you know almost all right I want to focus maybe a little bit more
self-critically on the places where I was not even wrong where you know in some ways I you know I
didn't I even I didn't even understand what the real issues were and I think about a little bit
what those were and I think one piece of the book that has held up relatively well
is the title the diversity myth it's an ambiguous title it can mean on the one you can put the
stress on the word diversity in which case you can then have debates of you know what does diversity
mean and if it is some sort of celebration of difference and then you can sort of debate what
kinds of diversity should one have and then there are all sorts of libertarian and conservative
critiques where you know you don't have real diversity if you have a group of people who
look different but think alike you know diversity in that sense probably should involve more than
just hiring the extras from the space cantina scene in star wars or something like that
but but there's a but there's a secondary maybe somewhat deeper meaning of the title
where you put the stress on the word myth and if you put the stress on the word myth you realize
that diversity or multiculturalism or or any of these words are extremely poorly defined and
that's the point they're not supposed to be defined they're they're sort of a it's sort of like a
false god idol shibboleth but it's it's it's it can never be be really defined and it works maybe
mostly as a sort of diversion or divert to small a distraction from the things that are truly
important and it is kind of like a I don't know it's a hypnotic magic show where you don't notice
the gorilla jumping up and down the back of the stage you're just narrowly focused on what
the tricks the magician is doing and and that and I want to I want to I want to try to explore
with you tonight is a map of the things that we've been distracted from by focusing too much on
wokeness anti-wokeness all these kinds of debates what what were we missing
so three three main ones I I'm going to go through
my brief comments tonight you know the the first one broadly is a category is if um
and this this would be a libertarian critique of diversity it would also be a marxist critique
is that uh is that when you focus on all these forms of identity politics you're not focused
enough on economics when you focus on you know race gender etc you're not going to focus enough on
class and so I think there is you know and there is even though I'm not a not a communist or marxist
I find that even the marxist critique probably has quite a bit to it where if you had a you know
what would be a marxist analysis of a diversity administrator and if you had Carl Marx or Rosa
Luxemburg here I think they would they would suggest that these people are roughly in the
same category as a bank robber or a prostitute because they're sort of a it's a form of crony
capitalism it's sort of a reactionary class that's somehow taking advantage of of the system
and um and then if we actually sort of look at the history of this where you know in some ways
cultural marxism replaced real marxism you know in the 1970s it roughly at least correlates
with the period when you know inequality grew massively when um the economy started to stagnate
and um and so when we when we stopped thinking about the economy there are sort of various
perspectives from both the left or right economics perspective where something there uh ceased to
work all that all that wealth and uh and then of course even you know economics is sort of somehow
in a libertarian or marxist form it grounds you into into substantive material type things
but maybe the the sort of libertarian marxist synthesis that I would want to explore a little
bit more is the Henry George uh the the late 19th century economists to in the late 19th century was
seen as pretty socialist today he's seen as pretty libertarian which I think doesn't simply reflect
sort of a way in which our society has changed but from the Henry George perspective the economic
relation that one always needed to look at was land ownership real estate distortions in real
estate and this is the the key driver and I want to submit that if there is an area of economics
that uh we we should pay more attention to it is it is something like that that there's something
about a georgist analysis of of real estate that is extremely suggested of of some very crazy things
that have happened in the last 50 years in our society um um one of the one of the numbers I've
seen on this and if you look at real estate in London it has an elasticity of minus two
which means that if you were to increase the supply of housing by one percent the average price
would go down two percent and if you multiply you know 1.01 by 0.98 you get a smaller number
and this leads the paradoxical result that the more housing you build in London the less it is
collectively worth and uh and so when you have a market that is this strangely dysfunctional
some you know extremely odd sorts of things start to happen um it um and and and you have to sort of
ask questions whether there is a kind of prony capitalism racket that uh that it starts to
happen in a lot of different ways where uh you know if you if you think about the uh the the
immigration debates in the UK or the United States um that there are all sorts of you know
extremely politically correct and extremely politically incorrect arguments on immigration
but but the sort of basic georgist economics argument is you know if you add two percent three
percent a year immigration to the UK and the elasticity is two to one then you know London
house prices will go up four to six percent a year um and um and then this is a basically
an extremely regressive tax on the half of the population that doesn't own houses it's an extremely
regressive tax on young people and it's basically a formula for left-wing radicalization of the
population over time and that's that's what we need to be able to now analyze and I would be
probably open to you know unrestrictive immigration if you could build more housing
um I think you know Elon will get to Mars before that happens in the UK um
and then if we you know if we if we look at something you know even more prosaic like uh
like at Oxford one of the news items I was I was reading uh was uh where I think the you
know it's relative to incomes the cost of housing is is among the worst in the UK and it's like a
you know mini london or a hyper london or something like that is is Oxford the the
jrr tolkien house is for sale for 4.5 million pounds and I would submit to you that if a if
an Oxford professor were to buy that house probably the university would be justified in
starting an inquiry into where the professor got the money to do that and uh and you have to you
have to sort of ask you know what what art you know and then of course if um you can't have
single family housing if there is no family formation possible for anybody in academia
you know is it really any wonder that you get this kind of
nihilistic proletarianization of of the faculty of the students of the younger generation and
where if you do not solve this sort of problem you know um it doesn't matter what you do with
all these other debates to use an to use an American example um you know 2007 from San Francisco
New York um you know I thought we were at a ridiculous housing bubble prices were you know
completely insane the rents were out of control you know same thing in london 2007 if you had told
me you know we'll fast forward to 2023 the prices are going to double I said this is just completely
impossible how would this how could this possibly happen if people would move they moved to a
different place and um and uh and if you had said well but but just just assume they doubled
how how you know what would have happened and I would I'd be tempted I don't know if I would
have predicted this but retrospectively one might say there must have been some crazy ideology
that infested people's minds and um and so you know if you're you know if you're a gay person
living in Manhattan maybe you're told that if you move to a suburb you'll be beaten up by people
with bats and so you have to pay a gay tax and live in a big city or if you're a woman living in a
rat infested apartment in San Francisco and you fantasize about a nice suburban house in Reno
Nevada maybe um you will be told that well if you move to Reno Nevada you're going to be changed
to your bed until you are forced to carry a baby to term and um and that sort of all of these kinds
of things would have intensified now I don't have to you know so so you know if we analyze wokeness
in terms of real estate you don't have to you know you don't have to go the full conspiracy
theory so I'm not you know I'm not arguing that something like Roe v Wade being overturned was
a conspiracy by um left-wing urban slumlords in the U.S. or something like this but um but if you
have a negative in the elasticity of the sword I described with London the kinds um you know where
this creates trillions of dollars of value that gets uh distributed redistributed shifted in the
sort of socially toxic way um isn't it even otter for us not to ask the question maybe not a full
intentional conspiracy but at least it's an emergent property it's the kind of thing that we
we tolerate um I will leave it as a politically incorrect exercise to you in this room to think
about the craziest woke excess in the UK of the last 10 years or so um and then um and then think
about how it increased aggregate housing prices in the UK and again not not saying it's causal but
just saying that uh maybe maybe if you could stop the housing racket um you'd start to get to the
roots of uh of this woke uh this woke disease now um now when we move beyond this sort of very
very stuck economy one of the other a second a second big area uh where this this focus on
identity politics diversity um tends to focus us on all these debates within the humanities and
this is this was also the the direction of the diversity myth book you just go through all all
these things that go wrong in the humanities and in the sort of in the liberal arts things like that
and you know the the the the sort of idea that I've come to over the last 15 20 years is that
perhaps just as broken as the humanities are the sciences um broadly speaking that they are not
they are no longer progressing they are for the most part pretty stuck it's a harder case to make
because science is a harder thing to understand um and um but uh you know when I was when I was
undergraduate in the late 1980s most of the science fields or tech even most of the engineering
fields one could have gone into would have been the wrong fields you know nuclear engineering
aero aster engineering terrible ideas already in the late 80s mechanical engineering chemical
engineering physics chemistry all these sort of science areas um somehow ended up being dead end
I think electrical engineering still barely worked for a while and then um really the only thing
that uh that uh that that uh had some sort of a future was uh was computer science which was
in the late 80s kind of a uh sort of a um a field of people who couldn't handle the um
the hardness of electrical engineering or math sort of dropped out of electrical engineering and
became a computer programmer um but uh but the you know the the rough picture of of scientific
technological progress I have is that you know for maybe the last 50 years we've had you know a
narrow cone of progress around the world of bits computers internet mobile internet software
but that the world of atoms you know where which is the world we are embedded in in some sense
matters more to us as human beings has been strangely stuck and this is you know this is even
in the word technology which um you know in some ways technology is just that that's that
which is progressing and today technology has been collapsed to IT information technology
because it is just this world of bits if you use the word technology in 1973 it would have meant
computers but it also meant new medicines it was meant the green revolution in agriculture it would
have meant um you know supersonic aviation it would have meant space travel technology was
advancing on many many different fronts and and you know in a in a world where this is stuck
and we can't even we're not even paying attention to that that surely is is a is a a big defect the
sort of us analogy that I've used on this is that um you know if you ask the question you know are
the humanities or the sciences less healthy the sort of governmental analogy would be um is the
department of motor vehicles um better or worse run than the NSA the national security agency or
maybe the maybe the british version would be something like uh the post office versus gchq
and the the seemingly straightforward answer is obviously the post office is not well run
or the dmv is not well run in the us and everybody can see it just like the humanities are quite
obviously sort of broken but uh but surely the more plausible answer is that the things you don't
understand and can't see are more corrupt and that where you have you know these ever narrower
groups of guardians guarding themselves the string theorists guarding the string theorists the cancer
researchers telling us about how great they all are and how they're all going to have these breakthroughs
in the next two years um that's surely uh the thing one should be more suspicious about one of my
one of my friends worked for uh was was um in the phd physics department at Stanford his advisor
bob lofland got a Nobel prize in physics in the late 1990s and um uh lofland suffered from the
supreme delusion that once he got a Nobel prize in physics he actually had he finally had academic
freedom and he could do whatever he wanted and uh he decided that he was going to investigate
these uh um you know some areas in science that were truly taboo and you know there's obviously
stuff you can't ask questions about climate change or evolution or you know even stem cell
research is probably you know a lot to ask too many questions about that but he decided to go into
something far more taboo than any of those things and it was he started with the premise that most
of these scientists were actually just defrauding the government they were engaged in semi-fraudulent
research um and they were they shouldn't you know he'd worked on high-temperature superconductors
he told me once that he thought you know there were 50 000 papers written in that field and only
about 25 of the 50 000 deserved to be published and um and they started with you know they started
with an inquest into the stampford biology department where uh he basically believed that
most of these people had um you know um effectively stolen money from the government and uh there's
been since then it's sort of a replication crisis in science that people have made more of
but uh the replication of crisis it always gets narrated in the slightly politically correct way
where we don't actually mention the specific names law from side no i'm just going to mention
the names of all the people and here's the list of people who are stealing money and as you can
imagine this uh you i don't even tell you how it ended but he got promptly defunded his students
can get phd's anymore and uh he at least got some kind of education about academic freedom
from from this process um and so so and so i think that uh um that uh you know i think in a
in a debate um if you have an argument there maybe are always i think two fundamental ways one can
try to um make a case and you can go after your opponent you can go after the enemy at the weakest
point which is where you're most likely to score a tactical victory or you can go after your enemy
at the strongest point um um and uh and if we if we criticize the universities for the humanities
that's in some sense what i don't know the central left the law of administrative establishment
wants us to do we can we can occasionally win some tactical victories but uh but you know the
where where they get you know their sense of validation their sense that everything is still
healthy and great is the sciences and if you can if you can show that the sciences are more corrupt
than the humanities uh it's harder to do but if you can do that you will win game set match
um and it's something you know i'm not you know it's always very difficult to do this but something
like the way i i would attempt it to make the argument is something like you know the string
theorists and physics are the smartest physics people and they've been stuck for 40 years and
and the physics people are the smartest people and so by some principle of transitivities
string theorists have been doing nothing uh there for everybody else has been doing nothing as well
and uh something something like that would be the the rough way the rough way i would i would make
this uh this sort of argument um now if we combine these these two two big um things we're being
distracted from we're being distracted from the economy even in its most basic forms like real
estate we're being distracted from from science um you know and then in some ways things have not
been healthy in the economy and science they've not been progressing the GDP has not been growing
in a balanced way for for quite some time there's always a question you know could we um and and
the wokeness is distracting us from from these things from from going back to these things
um if we if we focused on them would we be able would we be able to solve you know all of our
problems and just sort of as a maybe a little bit of an aside here i um i think um i think the the
temptation has always been to find um a straightforwardly economic solution to you know my version is
um broadly science and tech have been stagnant for something like 50 years
and the temptation is has been to find some kind of economic fix where we don't because getting
science and tech back on track it does sound pretty hard um and i i think the reason we haven't
been transparently stuck for 50 years is there were actually two one-time economic fixes that did
not involve science and tech that were done there was a you know there was a right wing
Reagan Thatcher fix in the 1980s um and there was a one-time solution where you could cut taxes
deregulate um a lot allow lots of mergers and acquisitions to happen and you could one time
gain enormous an enormous lift for the whole economy um but it doesn't continue if you rate
lower taxes from 70 percent marginal rates to 28 percent like they did in the u.s. but that's a
one-time lift it worked from 1983 to 1989 and then by the late 80s it was exhausted and we went
back to the cultural war debates they from the 1970s they came back in the early 90s and then
there was a one-time clinton blair solution circa 1995 to 2007 which was globalization and uh it
was also a way to increase GDP um it was probably um a far more ruthless ruthless way to do it than
capitalism um it created far more inequality the genie coefficient went up way more under
clinton than under reagan in the united states um but it also you know there were some gains from
that um there probably were some long-term costs from that as well um but they they both um
seemed really really hard to do uh the probably there's a way in which the the center right
isn't a healthier place than the center left because on the center right we don't really think
we can go back to to reaganism on the center left there's still some idea that they can go back to
clintonism or you know you know going back to that through the uk seems hard going back to blair
seems like maybe that's a mistake we still have to have to make in in the uk um but uh but i think um
but but certainly if we um if we can't think about um the economic issues more clearly the
real estate issues more clearly and uh and probably if we can't think about the science
and tech issues we don't even have um don't even have a hope to get back to a genuinely
progressing society let me um let me say something about maybe a third category that's sort of maybe
even bigger than let's say the economy for you know uh science writ writ large um and that is
that is something like you know the biggest you know i don't know the biggest possible topic
that one could have would be something like god it's something like and some ontological proof is
that there's nothing that you can imagine that's bigger than god and if and if these debates have
distracted us from the economy and from uh science they probably also have distracted us from
questions of religion of god of the christian god um and um and uh so that would be sort of my
my candidate for the biggest thing possible that we've been distracted from and as with
the sciences and with the economics it also um it's it's an odd thing for us to be distracted
from because it is so suggestive and has so many suggest so many different ways that this kind of
debate should be reframed um and in in particular um i want to do too much on metaphysics or things
like that but maybe just focus a little bit on on a you know survey what would christianity tell us
about history and then what does this history you know does that tell us something interesting about
our current historical moment and uh some some of these uh some of these debates that uh that uh
that we we we've been touching on over the last uh half hour here uh and basically um the the the
basic thesis i would have would be that uh frames a little bit provocatively would be that uh you
know uh perhaps the the original progressive was simply the christian god um you know the new
testament supersedes the old testament that's the original idea of something like progressivism
in um in in theology the new is better than the old the new transcends the old there's some sort of
progress in in history and and of course there you know there is sort of a a jewish or pagan
critique of christianity that uh those of us who are christian need to take very seriously which is
you know you know once you have this principle of the of the new testament supersede the new
superseding the old is there a limit do you is it is it just a slippery slope to communism to
wokeness to uh to ultra christian to some kind of antichristic parody um and uh and if you and
if we had to concretize this even even more uh you know there is something about um you know
there's there's one sense of course in which um what you know what the bible says about the founding
of the first city in the history of the world is the same as what mythology tells us about the
founding of the greatest city in the history of the world it starts with madness and murder so
pain kills abel romulus kills remus but the difference between the biblitha account and the um
let's say the uh the um the conventional religious account um is that the conventional
religions take the side of the city it takes the side room takes the side of romulus the bible
already already at the beginning in genesis takes the side of abel and there's of course there's
you know some sense in which the entire biblical tradition is from the point of view of the victim
you know the jews you know the normal way this the story of exodus would be written would be from
the point of view of the egyptians or these troublemakers and they they got removed it'd be
like the edipus myth where you get you get rid of edipus or something like that and uh and then
and then of course there is there is something like this um in um in in the in the christian story
itself where um it is a sort of inversion of perspectives and this uh this you know elevation
of a victimhood this idea that this is central um surely was uh was was one of the one of the key
pieces of it you know it's I think it's sort of the the late nature when he was you know when he was
sort of going going mad sort of had this it was always you know we need to we need to go back to
the strong classical world where you know the victims don't complain and um all this stuff is uh
you know is sort of healthy and robust and uh and uh but he sort of had some sense this was not
the way history was going and it's sort of the you know sort of in his towards his madness was
sort of god of the jews you have won he sort of has sensed that the 20th century were about to go
you know into overdrive on victimology and things of this sort and um and if if I had to sort of
differentiate maybe uh you know if I had to ask it as a question how is you know the christian view
different from let's say the neopagan view or the um or the the woke hyper the woke
ultra christian view something like that the you know and I find a lot that's extremely tempting
in a classical neopagan thing I don't know there's bronze age pervert or you know all these sort of
online people where it's why can't we just forget about the history and just um move on or you know
just um or go back to nature where you know nature nature as a word it does not occur once in the
old testament um and you know nature is buried red and tooth and claw but you know if you take
your bearings from nature we set nature as a standard then you don't there's nothing that's
really naturally evil nothing that's naturally morally wrong and uh and that that is sort of
always the let's say that the right wing pre-christian neopagan I don't know nichian
renaissance humanism all these different versions uh temptation to to sort of um go go back to that
and then uh then on the on the other side I would say something like
the um let's say the uh woke liberal you know um post christian maybe ultra christian temptation
is that we are going to be more christian than the christians we are going to we're going to you know
you know the poor shall inherit the earth and we're going to have a communist revolution and
we're going to accelerate the process and we'll make it happen even faster we're going to accelerate
the history even more um and there's always this question is it possible to be too christian
and I think the answer is in in theory no but in practice surely yes um and that in practice if you
you know if you try to hit the accelerator on this you don't end up um somehow uh um finding a way
to deal with the past but you simply end up creating some kind of um eternal recurrence
some kind of perpetual motion machine that generates nothing but uh violence and never
ending cycles of revenge it's it is sort of another version of the nichian eternal recurrence um
and so the you know the christian the christian perspective on this is always some paradoxical
combination that yes there was original sin yes in the beginning was madness and murder
yes there was incredible injustice in the past and then you need to forgive people
and um and if you if um and if you go with the if you go with the neopagan alt right whatever you
want to call it version and you say there was there was nothing bad in the past um uh I think
that somehow doesn't um stand up against the historical pressure of christianity against
the working out of the christian revelation in history if you uh um and then if you go with the
the the woke saying there's there's some sense in which it it it also uh that doesn't work for
for uh for for these opposite reasons um there's it's always hard to transpose this into these
different categories but the political categories i'm always tempted to use are something like
these 20th century categories fascism communism christian democracy and um and uh you know there's
always sort of the basis you know between fascism and communism you know are they you know are they
equally bad as communism is fascism worse and there's always a sort of conservative argument that
they're roughly equally bad they both killed millions of people and they're sort of in some ways
just copies of one another but the the um the sort of perspective leads me to think that uh we
should very squarely say that something like fascism was generally much less bad than something
like communism because um because fascism was was the past and it was just okay fascist the fascist
claim was the victims were all guilty and it's the historical victims from middle ages we're going to
go back to them and we're going to victimize them and then communism was sort of it was like always
like um sort of more in the future and it was uh we're going to go after the victimizers we're
going to victimize the victimizers it was sort of too clever by half and that that was always
the the far more powerful far greater temptation in our world and and uh and uh and that's why you
know even if someone like bronze age pervert or iron rand um is somehow wrong in their you know in
in their sort of um white washing of the past it's probably uh it probably is always at the
end of the day the more innocent mistake to make because we're in this in this world we're something
like the the hyper christian uh wokeness um the um the um original sin with no hope of forgiveness
is is is the greater temptation um you know it's um let me let me end with uh with maybe one
one thought you know i've given you three very big things that we've been distracted from the economy
science and tech broadly um you know the christian god but um but you know there's always a sense
which you say well the more immediate thing is still always these political questions and we're
in this political question and so maybe um maybe if if you have to have a political answer of um
what are we being distracted from politically where is wokeness distracting us from more important
things that are immediately political um i would suggest uh maybe one way to start is to think about
the etymology or the the sort of of the word of the term political correctness where
political correctness um you know by the 1980s it already was this conservative term that conservatives
used to criticize sort of intolerant liberals but if we go back to the 1970s political correctness
was actually termed liberals used to describe themselves where they were sort of like really
really progressive and were really politically correct and that it was a term of self-congratulation
and if you went back to the 1950s the the original meaning of political correctness
was that it was um you were a politically correct comrade because you were following the orders
directly from mosco and you were following the party line of the communist party and um and so if
we you know um if we go back to the original meaning of of political correctness and and
sort of think that you know the real problem is something you know something like communism even
though it's you know communism fascism in the 20th century were youth movements and we're sort of
dealing with a gerontocratic version of this so it's different demographically it's very different
but uh but something something like ultra christianity communism this this set of things is
is the real problem today and so this is a great simplification uh great reduction but when you
could do much worse than whenever you hear the term dei to just thank ccp thank you very much
well let's begin to um uh explore these um very deep questions and profound thoughts that
have been put before us and I think we should recognize that
they're all attempts I think Peter to um shake us out of our distraction
there were three types of distraction here the beginning one was the first one was the way in
which debates about woke and anti-woke about culture um very often lead us to turn our thoughts
away from fundamental contradictions in economic life and this is a way in which uh
Peter's way of thinking combines certain aspects without being a libertarian oramaxist of
libertarian oramaxist critiques of our current economic regime uh the second was which I found
particularly fascinating was the way in which the kind of paradigmatic contrast which many
people including I myself have made between ethics and politics uh as not being highly progressive
and science and technology is being highly progressive as being prototypically progressive
is not in fact substantiated by the actual evidence that sciences and technology except in
a few narrow fields have been stuck in the same categories of thinking in the same theoretical
frameworks and even the same types of technology for about 50 years and then the third type of
distraction um that this talk was trying to rid us of or shake us out of was um a distraction in
which um questions of religion or of theology or of um not exactly metaphysics but of the way we
ultimately think about good and evil and how human beings are in the world have been pushed
on one side and yet they continually reappear with woke not actually being at all as some
people have said on the right a repaganization of the world but as being a type of hyper christianity
emptied of transcendence and forgiveness and that leads to I guess a question my question
to you peter is um is there some way out of this because in a way I think one of the things you
said which was most interesting was the attempt to in the 20th century in fascism and other
types of thinking were now in interesting writers uh uh light bronzates pervert or earlier on in
rand what they were doing was I would think in your terms peter was actually very interesting but
impossible because you can't this would you think this is true you can't actually get back to a
classical or pre christian view of the world in which energy and vitality empower what matters and
victimhood is contemptible or unimportant once christianity is there so we can't go back and
that's true of the other the previous two we can't go back to earlier forms of science we can't go
back to earlier forms of economic thinking although I thought what you said about every church was
very interesting are we really stuck can we actually can you actually is it possible to
unstick us I think it is because I think you're already unstickiness tonight where would you
think that there's the best chance of unstickiness well uh man it's it's uh well my very fast
alliance was always the first thing you have to you have to um do to solve problems is to talk
about so I I think that as long as we have this as you described groundhog day of wokeness um we are
we are we are not we're not going to be unstuck and um we're going to be in the sort of you know
zero-sum you know somewhat malthusian ever nastier political uh kind kind of a context um I yeah I
think there are there's certainly our ways there probably are ways all three of them could um could
could be you know ways we could we could get unstuck on all three dimensions I you know I I
think there's some way that the pure capitalism pure globalism uh things probably don't quite work
in economics I I I do think one could probably do something about the real estate problem it is
it's so extraordinarily distorted and uh and so that's that that uh there probably are things one
can do it's it's very hard because you would destroy trillions of dollars in value in in doing it um
but uh but uh but that that's that that probably you know it has to give at some point maybe it's
a technological fix you know the way the way the henry george thing was was historically solved
was you had an open frontier in america and then the frontier closed in the late 19th century so the
railroads were the technology to open the frontier eventually the frontier is populated it's closed
and then late 19th early 20th century the cities start to have this georgist runaway real estate
price effect rising inequality and you get progressivism as a as a response to the closing of the
frontier and then in the 20th century in a way another frontier got opened with the automobile
and the highways and the suburbs and that uh that uh that relieved the pressure on on the
runaway costs and then that that technology has also run its course and there's a question
is there some way to reopen a frontier in in real estate and and probably you know the one where I
think the jury is very out and doesn't look that promising in 2023 but it would be something like
could one really get remote work to work could you could the internet be a way uh that people are
not stuck in these cities and uh that would reset all these real estate values tremendously because
even in a rather densely populated country like england there is plenty of space if you're not
forced to be in within the green belt of london itself and and certainly the united states even
more so so um and then then i think within the within the technology area my my my hopeful sense
is that uh there is you know there's always a question you know what why did the technology
slow down and uh the science slowed down and um the thing i'm hopeful on is that it was not that
we just ran out of ideas it's it's that there were these deformations of culture we became too
risk averse too bureaucratic too much peer review in the sciences and um and i think i think we could
be making a lot more progress in a lot of areas um it's you know it's regulated people are scared
of technology uh we don't want to minimize or trivialize their fears but uh but i i think uh
you could have a very different balance there and then yeah and and certainly the questions
about the larger meaning of life or the meaning of history um are you know are ones that i think
would all do well to to confront more um to take in a way what might be the most immediate
uh um part of what you've just said and said before i guess it implies which i think is
absolutely true that the so-called consensus that prevails between say sunak and starma
is far more consensus on what we're not supposed to think about that it is on to anything positive
because the big problems you've mentioned the problems stagnation and science the problems
of real estate in london and oxford and throughout the country the problems of
generational inequity in which young people can't find any way to live and so they're all
hardly addressed at all there's a bit of commentary in the newspapers and so on but in terms of
thinking about active solutions there perhaps maybe some dim subliminal awareness among these
politicians that the solving them would involve big losses for somebody uh yes or certainly big
losses for them in the election is the felt sense and uh and so uh yeah and it's not certainly not
limited to the uk but certainly outside perspective i would have it because it seems to me that yeah
there's a secret agreement between sunak and starma let's say to um to um um talk as much as
possible about culture wars take various sides on those issues and um and then if you if you have
even even basic economic questions like a runaway deficit spending and do you solve this with higher
taxes or lower entitlements um and then and then they both have a look at function where if we if
we talk about that we'll we'll lose 10 or 15 percent of the voters um i mean maybe maybe not
quite as many for sunak since sometimes hard to lose 10 or 15 percent of the voters but um but uh
there's some there's some kind of a you know some kind of a look at function where um um we shouldn't
touch that but then you know then when everybody does that whenever you know when all the solutions
are outside the oberton window um you know we end up with yeah we're we're confined in in this
very narrow box and um and the groundhog day will continue until at some point something really breaks
so there won't be a niche on groundhog day it won't really be eternal it's going to break down
isn't it i mean that's one way or the other even if only for economic reasons but we don't know when
oh how sure uh sure yeah i mean i i think there are there certainly are all kinds of dimensions
one could one could point to where where it is you know it is not simply stable you know the
demographics are not stable the deficits are not stable we had pseudo stability and deficits for 40
years in the united states and much of the western world where the the deficits were too big but the
interest rates went steadily down and something around that seems to have broken in the last year
or two so i think even something as basic as deficits financed at zero percent interest rates
it seemed like the 2010s could go on forever and that seems over and they haven't
yeah ended with the 2020s yeah yeah is there also does that bleed back into though the
segue back into the cultural and the religious questions you discussed because i guess part of the
resistance to your analysis of science is a kind of quasi religious uh conception of the
salvific possibilities of science that science can do what religion hasn't done uh which is to
actually change worldly life in a way which results of its deepest contradictions and i guess if
for some people if they gave up that faith in science they would be left with nihilism
or left with despair or left with unbearable anxiety yeah although it's it's sort of a
yeah obviously there's a very complicated history of science and it was in some ways
maybe a byproduct of christianity and so it was an opposition to christianity
um and and certainly in its in its healthy ambitious early modern forms um whether it was
a substitute or a compliment to christianity um it uh it was supposed to be um it was somehow
supposed to be a vehicle for comparable transformation and sort of the indefinite
prolongation of human life um was an early modern science project and people yes still
believe very much in the 17th 18th century i think there was a you know sub movement within
sort of the revolutionary soviet politics uh it was still very healthy in the 1920s called
cosmism yes where um a part of the project of the of the revolution had to be to physically
resurrect all dead human beings yes um and because if science didn't do that it would be inferior to
christianity or something like that that's sort of one of their slogans they had to adapt themselves
the cosmos to the soviet and bolshevik reality was debt of the world unite
because they wanted to bring back not only not only that everyone in the present generation
would live forever but that all the people who'd ever died would come back and so so there there
is um this this let's say anti christian or riveted from christian you know a very ambitious
version of science and of course there is a there is a also a more defeatist version of science
where science actually tells us about limits and things you cannot do uh when i don't know when
there's a literary example when when um hamlet's evil mother gertrude says that all that lives
must die um you know the the question you have is is that a law of nature or or is this just a
rationalization for the rottenness that is denmark and certainly the early modern conception was that
you wanted to transcend this both in a christian or a scientific form and then
yeah late modernity it's probably a i attribute more as a decay of science that this sort of ambition
is is more fringe science thing than a mainstream science thing and i guess there's also a kind of
nihilistic version of science in a way a sort of brave new world version in which sees itself as
um pacifying the spiritual and mental anguish and doubts of human beings by giving them access
to drugs and pornography and all kinds of things which distract them forever from these fundamental
existential questions the religious questions i mean what would work to exterminate religion wouldn't
be or to terminate the need for religion wouldn't be persecuting at that obviously has never worked
but to try and put everyone asleep with dreams of um drug dreams drug highs and um
and of course drugs are a tremendous feature of our life of life at the moment aren't they
in many countries i wouldn't even go that that that far you know the the line i i was using this
is just you know the the iphones that distract you from your environment will distract you from
fact you're in a hundred year old subway in london or new york or the environment hasn't changed
and uh and then i again i don't think one should make it fully intentional but there's
you know there is there is something about certain narrow forms of uh technical progress
that have more of this uh retarding effect elsewhere or this you know making us oblivious
to what's what's going on effect um and uh and but yeah i think i think most of it is not it's
it's not supposed to be ambitious world transforming um it is not at all early modern science it's
much more i don't know you know probably the you know probably the strongest um science and
poly one of the stronger science and politics themes is always the the climate the climate
change debate and there's um if you take climate change seriously there are all kinds of progressive
science things one could do you could be pushing for the construction of hundreds of new nuclear
reactors you could be pushing for fusion there's sort of all kinds of ways that you could be concerned
about climate change and lean into rapidly progressing science and then um and then in
practice it's it's it's much more that you know maybe you should just ride a bicycle or or something
like that and so it's uh it's somehow a lot of science has this luddite feel even though it's
obviously you can find lots of different things or start eating insects rather than rather than
beef because beef but one i mean that thought it um that the function of one of the functions of
smartphones is to distract us from the fact that we're living in a victorian environment still
with victorian sewers and victorian subways and victorian buildings uh is a i think a very profound
world thought because it it suggests that one of the functions of technology which is
something that affects the material world is to supplant the material world in our own lives
so that we live in a virtual world more and more of the time of course it's got physical roots this
fair to this virtual world so if something goes wrong with the physical roots if there is war
terrorism or climate change or whatever then it's all it's disrupted but that that's part of the way
it works isn't it uh well certainly um that's the the part of technology that's been healthiest
has been has been still the most progressive is this narrow cone around yeah this virtual world
i keep thinking that you could do a lot more in these other areas if i um again come back to
something like the the real estate housing version this this seems the furthest from
technological innovation you know they're i mean they're new building designs you can build
100 story buildings that you could not build 20 30 years ago um there are presumably you know some
new things one could even do there but if too much of the economy it's anchored on things that are
hard to improve or change that is also a way in which um progress slows so if if we have an economy
in the uk and i'll make these numbers up where it's 50 real estate and 10 computers um then even
if the 10 percent that is computers is somehow getting better and better if uh 50 percent that
is real estate is very stuck um that is going to be at best a um a slowly improving economy and then
you know the most important thing is somehow not going to be changing it and then that probably
creates all kinds of weird side effects and incentives so the hyper progressivism the hyper
accelerationism that we are told we we have by politicians and others by Blair for example that
we're accelerating in uh it doesn't it doesn't show it does not show up in the in the per capita
gdp numbers it does not show up in um incomes rising faster than rents yes i i just think the the
bottle is simply on the real estate side yes that yes and then and then you can be told that people
don't want to live in houses anymore they don't want to have families there's they're conscious
you know you shouldn't have children because you're just feeding insects but um but then uh so we
but at some point uh again at some point this is not this is really a parody not not really
progressivism i didn't attend it but it was a meeting in um london of Blair and some of his
disciples and many parties including the conservative party in which for him the next phase of acceleration
was precisely the one in which your analysis suggests there's been the most the most
the largest and most neglected stagnation in your technology which is that all the globalization
might not have gone far enough we've retreated from it we shouldn't have but we have it's gonna
still gonna go on but we're gonna try we're resisting it so how can we cope with the situation
in which we're not uh getting enough acceleration from globalization where we'll accelerate the
technological side and yet if what is accelerating if what's it's it's gonna be AI and the virtual
world i guess he thinks that we can solve our problems in medical care by AI that's the solution
for him look it's always it's always dangerous for me to comment on too much on british politics
but i i might my my my my senses that uh Blair occupies this very very strange place where it is
it is this past it obviously does not work we obviously cannot go back to the sort of globalization
that he represented or doing more of it in some sense doesn't work but it never gets articulated
and and so it has a very different quality than let's say thatcherism where there's you know and
again i was in some ways very sympathetic to Liz trust but there's some sense in which it didn't
work and somehow it's it's it's clear that we somehow can't go back to thatcherism or doing
more of thatcherism isn't going to be a solution and then whereas on the left it's in this very
strange in-between zone where somehow Blair is not being run as a candidate for prime minister
officially if he well if you but again i'm just going if he ran officially yeah one suspects it
would work very badly yes but then um but then you know if you're someone like starmer you know
what labor leader do you do you want to emulate do you want to emulate atlee which i probably is not
that that that doesn't work and then maybe Blair is the only other one on offer and so
that's sort of the default idea even though it never gets articulated which tells you it's
probably not very good absolutely i mean i guess the difference is that when the there's trust
wing of the conservative party wants to go back to thatch it because they see that as a radical
moment and they want to repeat the radical moments but because radical moments are very hard to keep
repeating all the time well they're they're hard they're hard to repeat by doing the same thing
doing the same thing so it's it's it's it's certainly there was a one-time move to deregulate
and lower taxes um and and then um not clear one can do doing it the second time does as much good
you know mckinsey mckinsey was a real thing in 1985 in the united states if you had if you
hired a consultant they actually helped you improve your company you know because the companies were
badly run at this point mckinsey is a total racket it's just all fake yeah and um and so if we if
it's if you have a reagan if you have a you know and the the the reagan thatcher administration
they empowered mckinsey because they allowed more companies to be acquired more mna activity to happen
and it was a you know a somewhat brutal but very powerful reorganization of society and that was
possible and that was the right thing to do in the 1980s um you know at this point um mckinsey is
not ever going to be anything other than a super corrupt fake racket in 2023 and so we can't go back
to that specific thing you know it's fascinating the way in which the product of these revolutionary
changes in the economy and society and thinking produces a proliferation of rackets in science too
and i guess that's connected with um fakery fakery that's to say so many of the phenomena
around us are fakery i i don't know if i don't know if it has to happen that way but um um
what one of my um one of my colleagues maybe this would be another way to to link the um
the sciences to the the wokeness problem but um um is that institutions um it has this term
institutions have embedded growth obligations egos in short ego embedded growth obligations
and um and so a a healthy institution in some sense is one that has this exponential growth
and if you have exponential growth there will be more jobs and everyone can get promoted
and there's sort of a way that if a company has exponential growth that's a healthy company
and there are other versions of this in in different forms and then um at some point
maybe the growth stops and um and when the growth stops um you have a choice you can
you can maybe become more honest and say well you know the university isn't growing anymore
there'll be very few faculty slots available if you if you're in a phd program we're gonna
we're gonna um we're gonna um make sure that 80 percent of the students uh drop out of the
program within six months so they don't waste their time um and uh we're gonna be honest about
the fact that there's no growth um or the the thing that i think unfortunately happens a great deal
is you just lie and the uh and the institutions become sociopathic where they pretend that the
growth is still going on and then it's only years and years later that people figure out
that uh that um there are no jobs and it doesn't and and and you know the wokeness was just you
know it's just a distraction it's sort of like uh you know if you have nine if you have 10 graduate
students in a chemistry program and there's a job for only one of them and you're having
fist fights over beakers and bunsen burners and um and you're in the sort of malthusian struggle
and there's one person who says something slightly racist or slightly inappropriate
i mean it's such a relief you can throw that one person off the overcrowded bus right but uh
but uh but again i uh so these are these are natural things to happen but but but surely um
we would do better to um to find ways to to get back to to growth in as many places of
our society as possible indeed because what you just said is um that the solution to non-growth
is persecution um you can eliminate various people from from the competition by counseling them
pushing them out they're not they're not there anymore they're what was termed in the first
constitution of the soviet union in fact i think in 1918 1919 former persons
former persons so if you make these people former persons at least they're not competitors anymore
they're out so that's a very again a very interesting because unless we grow in certain
ways in knowledge and technology in a genuine way we're going to have this persecutory mentality
this person it has a function it has a role even an economic or a career structure role and so
yeah but it's but it's always important to um understand the persecution is not as ideological
as it's dressed up no so um because um if it's actually driven by scarcity you will just have
scarcity the the the the u.s. academic version of this you know when i when i wrote the diversity
myth book in the in the early 90s i was thinking to myself you know academia discriminates against
conservatives libertarians like myself and um i think that was true for one cohort of baby boomer
academics who got phd's in the 70s and couldn't get tenure in the 80s in the u.s. but by my generation
where i would have gotten a phd in the 1990s it was obvious there was no job because i was
conservative and so um the conservatives were actually not discriminated against it was the
liberals that were discriminated against who are gen X millennial um because they all had the
delusion that um it was yeah it was kind of zero sum but as long as you've told the correct party
line yes we're safe and that was of course also the delusion that the uh the party line communists
had when the when they were disproportionately targeted by the Stalin show trials in the 1930s
the soviet term for it was always uh section 58 of the soviet penal code was that you were guilty
of counter revolutionary activity and i think the key to understanding that was that uh everybody
was guilty and there were just some people who were not being prosecuted for the time being
by the government and uh and so in in this world of extreme scarcity you know eventually everybody
gets um it's somehow deplatformed or ejected or or something like that uh just about i mean the
soviet analogies are very rich i think it was another soviet term which was telling lies that no
one believes in and that was seen as an essential thing because one of the things if you're surrounded
by lies and every single person including the people who tell them know that they're lies know
that that's not the truth then it sort of hinges you to some extent and it makes you scared and
also because the party line what determines what's a lie and what's a lot changes inexplicably all
the time i think in a way we've progressed beyond the soviets now in that respect because we've
really got to the point where no one really knows what the party line is but everyone's terrified
from deviating from it it's the postmodern version of the party you know i yeah i think i think it's
always so hard to know exactly what's going on we're in this strange postmodern world it's it's
probably um i think people are um generally quite cynical they don't don't believe all the lies
they're being told it gets discounted pretty heavily um but nevertheless it has this effect
where somehow um we can't focus on the really important things that are going on of this of
the sort that i that i talked about and so it does have this and i'll come back to this metaphor
that it is like this hypnotic magic magic trick and um and and the important thing is not what
the magician is doing but what the magician is distracting us from and maybe even the magician
is taken in by the sleight of hand maybe it's easier to um live with oneself as a magician
a political magician a technological magician uh if you really think there's something in it although
you can never quite see what it is because the trick is almost bigger than you there's a well
there's a whole division among magicians between the ones uh there's a class that claim that it's
real and there's a class that claim that it's fake and so yes that is uh that that is i believe
the sociology of magicians as they're those two competing camps how how far is there just social
science fit into this um there was a wonderful book about 70 years ago by uh not 70 years ago in the
70s 1970s by the sociologists poly sociologists i knew there was a marthas book in every way but
the very best part of it was that it was called social sciences as sorcery in 1970s and he was
arguing that the whole 80 or 99 not that there's no social science or that there can't be didn't
think that he thought there was and there could be more of it but that much of it was just um um
the kind of magical transposition of terms forms of distraction from real problems
that you're talking about that actually a lot of it was it was theorized and systematized distraction
so if you talk about uh um identity struggles you're missing out very profound structural
inequalities economic and temperature that's an obvious example he took examples of plagues
uh uh and even of syphilis in which people talked about in all sorts of complex ways of power
structures but the basic thing is the thing itself the material thing it's a way of avoiding
contact with the material world isn't it yeah i wouldn't it feels like that's slightly too strong
since i think i gave i'm not sure it was this i wouldn't want to call it a social science speech
today but uh some kind of um some kind of attempt to analyze these things in terms of um the history
politics uh sociology psychology of our of our of our societies but yes i think i think a lot of
these soft fields do you have this quality that um they are they are i want to say that they are
in theory extremely important and there's something about them that is uh an extremely
important way at at getting at things and then or that reason they are also extremely prone to
to politicization of various sorts uh you know one of one of the things i always like to say is that
any field that has the term science in it um should always be suspicious because it's it's
sort of um it's um it's exaggerating it's a social science political science climate science
even computer science you know it started as computer science because it had a very
serious inferiority complex to math and electrical engineering and it's not i think accidental
and though it's often forgotten that both of the great terrible movements the 20th century communism
and Nazism actually which is often seen as anti-scientific but was in fact often defended
in the 30s and 20s and then 40s by biological or racial science that just as dialectical
materialism diamat as it was called then was in was was the greatest science that ever been
so so these repressive movements uh murderous movements movements which killed millions of
people but also killed off thought wherever they could well all advanced they all thought
it very important to call themselves science well it's it's uh i don't know this is maybe
sort of a philosophy of science thought i have then is that um i think you know in theory what
science is supposed to do is fight a two front war against excessive dogmatism and excessive
skepticism and if you're and and and and so um excessive dogmatism is like i know the decayed
Aristotelianism of the medieval church and that was what uh science was in some ways fighting in
the 17th and 18th century and then excessive skepticism if um i can't trust my senses and i
don't know whether i'm sitting in front of you if you're too skeptical you also can't do science
and then these these two this two front war is intention it's it's hard it's actually hard to
get that balance it's very hard to get that balance right probably the early modern version i would
say was more anti dogmatism than anti skepticism um if we fast forward to 2023 um and we um there are
all kinds of things where um i know the scientific establishment the uh the leading scientists
would caution us against being too skeptical not supposed to be vaccine skeptics we're not
supposed to be climate science skeptics we're not supposed you know it's it's it's fighting
skepticism in all its forms and then um you know i i i'd be hard pressed i could maybe
held a gun to my head i might be able to come up with one or two things but be very hard pressed
to come up with a single instance where a scientist would say this is an area where
science is too dogmatic today in 2023 the string theorists wouldn't say we're too dogmatic about
string theory but you know just a very very hard press to say where it's too dogmatic
and that surely tells us that um somehow it has degenerated into uh into into something that's
you know more dogmatic than the medieval church it's if you're just fighting skepticism it tells
you you're a dogman that's probably probably there was some some version of this with uh
with the totalitarian science of the early 20th century where it um it leveraged the term
so it was somehow still pretending to be anti dogmatism anti supernatural anti that sort of
stuff but uh but in reality um the uh the anti skepticism dominated which which leaves us to
in a situation of that with the near impossibility of empiricism in the sense of a way of thinking
which tries to connect with facts in the world so if you say well actually racism in certain
contexts is less prevalent than these claims which have been made suggests someone will say
that's you think that because you're a racist you're neglecting the systematic structural
hidden subterranean patterns the occult patterns of racism so to speak which are there so um and
this by the way strikes me as a feature of liberal thought in even in its attempt to prescribe
solutions which is that if some if a liberal experiment doesn't work say liberal experiments
in drug legalization or drug decriminalization the solutions are not to say they've been falsified
it's to say double up triple up quadruple up do it three or four times and then it will work
so can we get I mean I wouldn't say get back to empirical thinking because I guess science was
never that closely empirical but closer to it than we've been in which someone will accept that um
we are too dogmatic about x y z that maybe we don't know the answer maybe we've actually
got to go out and check things to see what's happening well I you know there's empirical
thinking there's analytical thinking I I would like us just to get back to thinking the hardest of
all we just let's try to do that I'm wondering if that might be the moment on which I can thank
Peter for stimulating stirring and stimulating fertilizing my thinking on all of these issues
and whether we can all thank him for coming here and enabling us to receive his thoughts
and um start thinking
