I recently found one of these seeds in my garden which was kind of interesting because it hadn't
come off a tree anywhere nearby. But what I love about these seeds is that when you drop them they
spin like a helicopter and float down slowly to the ground. But why do they? Now when I ask this
question I'm not looking for the reason why they spin, but instead why does the spinning of the
seed cause it to fall slower than if it wasn't spinning? Here I have a three bladed rotor head,
it's 3d printed and each blade is angled down at five degrees to cause it to spin when dropped
from a high altitude. Now this has a diameter of 60 centimeters and I also have a parachute
with a diameter of 60 centimeters. Now the surface area of this parachute is 10 times the surface
area of those three blades. So I also have one more parachute which has the same surface area
as the three blades and what we're going to do is we're going to drop them from this large drone
and see how fast they fall. So let's first give the large parachute a test.
So I do actually get an altitude readout on my transmitter here. So here we go test number one
of the large parachute. There we go.
So landing all by itself.
So now let's remove the large parachute and bolt on the rotor head and then we'll drop it from the
same height. Oh the parachute's lifted. Okay so it's now at 41 meters which is basically the same
as before. Releasing in three two one. Hey that's working excellent. Right now return to home.
The drone is flying itself back whilst I go and get the rotor head. Right so it seems like we have
some damage. That must have hit the ground at quite a high rpm and obviously just broke at the hub
which is where the weakest point is. Cool so that was a successful test apart from the
break of the blade but it floated down nice and slowly. I have a small feeling that this thing
is going to drop like a rock but I suppose that's what we're here to test out. Why does the spinning
of the rotor blade cause it to fall slower than if it were just a parachute? In three two one.
So the large parachute had the slowest descent rate at about 3.5 meters per second
and the rotor blade hit the ground about six seconds earlier giving an average descent rate
of about 5.5 meters per second. However it did also take almost two seconds for the rotor head
to spin up. Therefore I've done some quick calculations to work out the actual descent
rate to be about four meters per second. So it's faster than the large parachute with the same
diameter however it did fall a lot slower than the smaller parachute with the same surface area
which fell at just over 10 meters per second. So why does the spinning of the rotor blade cause
it to fall slower than if it wasn't spinning? At first it might seem intuitive to assume that
the spinning causes it to act like a disc as if the world of fluid dynamics worked like a long
exposure camera shot but unfortunately fluid dynamics aren't that simple. As the blade rotates
the tip of the blades are traveling a lot faster than the blade part near the hub due to it traveling
a greater distance in the same amount of time. Now because the blade is falling downwards there is
an oncoming air hitting it from underneath but there is also a horizontal direction to the airflow
due to the rotation of the blade. This results in an oncoming airflow angle looking something like
this. Now if we look at the airflow hitting the tip of the blade it reveals a greater horizontal
velocity airflow due to its greater rotational speed which not only means it's experiencing a
greater airspeed but also a reduced angle to the oncoming air. If we label what the lift and drag
forces look like we get a resultant force close to vertically upwards and if we do the same for
the center of the blade we get a force angled slightly forwards. This is essentially how auto
gyros work where a center section of the rotor blade is acting like a wind turbine causing the
whole thing to spin and this drives the outermost section of the rotor blade which is basically a
fast moving wing and produces lift. Okay so that's all well and good but why would you pick a rotor
head over a parachute? Parachutes are far simpler, far lighter and can be packed into a small space
before deployment. Well I'm glad you asked because so did NASA. I found this archive of
old footage on the NASA Langley YouTube channel which I highly recommend you check out if you're
interested in all sorts of experimental testing and I found this footage of what looks like a
space capsule with an auto rotating rotor head attached to it. In that same video they were
also testing an interesting parachute known as a vortex ring parachute which is designed to spin
once deployed. I then found this Apogee newsletter which contained information on how to build your
own spinning parachute which apparently has almost twice the coefficient of drag as a regular
shoot. So let's build one. The instructions didn't have exact dimensions but more of a guide to build
your own sized parachute so I scaled this one to have the exact same surface area as the large
parachute I tested earlier. That way I can test both parachutes to get a comparison. Right so I
now have the conventional parachute with a diameter of 60 centimeters and I also have the rotary
parachute with the same surface area. Okay we're going to start with the conventional parachute
and because it's slightly windier today I've got a slightly heavier weight to drop from it.
Okay that's about 40 meters dropping in three two one.
That fell very fast. Right so next up we have the rotary parachutes if it doesn't get tangled
Three two one.
I mean that kind of spins.
So it kind of works but I think we need to run the test a few more times
whilst we hear a word from our sponsor. Skillshare offers thousands of inspiring classes for
creative and curious people on topics including design, video, freelancing and more. Membership
gets you unlimited access to thousands of online classes with hands-on projects and feedback from
a large community of other creators. So how about making 2020 a year where you explore new skills
and get lost in the creativity with Skillshare's online classes. I highly recommend this introduction
to aerial videography class as it runs through all the essentials when starting with drone
videography such as safe and legal practices, understanding how to operate a camera and also
how to pre-plan drone flight to get the best shots possible once at location. Skillshare is also
incredibly affordable with an annual subscription working out at less than $10 per month. Skillshare

vortex ring parachute that I was able to capture. Falling with a descent rate of 3.7 meters per
second which was less than half the speed of the regular shoot with the same weight falling at 7.5
meters per second. I think the regular shoot may have fared better in low winds as it did swing
pretty violently probably increased the descent rate by quite a bit. I really wanted to test the
vortex ring parachute a bit more but then this happened.
But I decided to release the weight anyway. Oh that didn't work.
That could have easily taken out this drone. Good job I had a low quality string.
Right I'm covered in mud, the drone's covered in mud and so is the weight.
Also the parachute is destroyed so let's go back inside.
In conclusion I think the vortex ring parachute is a really interesting concept
but I also think that there's a reason why NASA aren't using on their space capsules today.
Yes the coefficient of drag is greater for the same amount of material used however in the end
a recovery system has to be reliable. If you enjoyed this video it'd be great if you could

patreon.com for making these videos possible. Also a quick update if you're already subscribed
to me you'll notice that this video isn't uploaded on the Friday like they usually are
that's just because I'm switching things up a little. Also I've created a second channel
which thanks to everyone over on Twitter was voted the highest name to be TimStation which may be
subject to change and on that channel I'm just going to upload slightly less effort content.
I'm probably going to make some short videos and very soon actually I want to make a video on
this drone because I built this drone from scratch it's all CNC cut on my CNC mill and
quite a few people have been asking after my Dan Buster's video where I got the drone from
so I may make a short video on more information about this. So if you want to go check out my

watching I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye.
