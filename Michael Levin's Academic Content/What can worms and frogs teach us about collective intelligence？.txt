Thank you so much. That's very kind and it's been a real honor and a privilege to get to
know Bill and work together on these projects. So thank you for inviting me here. This is
a new kind of audience for me and I've put together a talk that I haven't given before
so let's see how it goes. By the way, if anybody's interested afterwards in the details, all
of the sort of official peer reviewed kind of stuff, the software, the papers, everything
is here and then here are sort of a little bit more personal thoughts about what I think
it all means and things like that. So let's begin here. This is a well-known painting
it's called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden and there are two interesting
things about this old story. One of them I think is needs to really be redone and ditched
and the other one is very profound and I think it's going to be important for us going forward.
The one that needs to be dropped is this idea here that there are discrete natural kinds
of beings. We know what they are. Here are these large, mostly cute sorts of animals.
There's Adam. We know what they are. They're discrete. They're different from each other.
Adam, of course, is different from all of them and that, as you're going to see in
a minute, does not do justice to the incredible plasticity of life. Our attempts to bin it
into these categories is not going to fly. What is really profound here I think is that
in that original story, you may or may not know that neither God nor the angels were
able to name the animals. It was Adam that had to do it. The job was on him and there
are a couple of reasons why that might be. One is because in these old traditions, naming
something or discovering the name of something means you've discovered something about its
true inner nature. I think that's important because we, as humans, are going to have to
discover the inner nature of a very wide set of beings that Adam could not even have begun
to dream of. The other thing is, of course, Adam is the one that has to live with them.
His understanding of his world and the other beings around it is going to be critical for
him to develop.
I want to talk about a few things today. First is some thoughts on information, evolution,
and selves, this notion of collective intelligence and where it comes from. I want to talk about
the paradox of change and how biology handles it. Now, the paradox of change can be said
as follows. This is scaled to the level of evolution, but I think you will see the obvious
implications for personal and possibly company growth and things like that. The paradox is
if you're a species and you fail to change, you're going to go extinct. If you do change,
you likewise will, in an important sense, cease to exist. What does that mean? How do
we as beings preserve ourselves in some sense as we inevitably change? We change physically,
we change mentally. If you don't change mentally, you can't learn. There's some sense in which
a profound educational process changes you so that you're not the same, certainly growing
up. We'll do that and so on. This is a really interesting paradox and I'm going to show
you how I think biology handles it. We're going to talk about a few other topics such
as plasticity, diverse intelligence, and creative interpretation, a.k.a. polycomputing that
biology uses across scales. We're going to start our journey here through the eyes of
a frog with an eye on its butt. Now, if anybody asks you in the future, have you ever seen
a frog with an eye on its butt, now you can say yes. This is a frog we have made in our
lab. This is not Photoshop. This is not AI. This is a real eye on its butt. The reason
that these kinds of things are possible is because biology commits to a certain kind
of creative process to solve this problem. The way that frog came to be is that we took
tadpoles. Here's a tadpole, here's the brain, the nostrils, the mouth, the gut, the tail.
What we did was we put some eye cell precursor cells on the back of this tadpole. The cells
go ahead and they make an eye. I'll tell you another story about ectopic eyes in a minute,
but that's how we did this is by transplantation. You'll also note that he doesn't have any
primary eyes. We prevented those from forming, but we put an eye on his tail. Then we built
this machine. This was an incredible ordeal. It took probably five years, about a million
bucks, which is huge for a lab, to build this kind of thing. What the machine does is test
these tadpoles in visual assays. Basically, there's a little spot of light and they have
to either chase or stay away from the moving light in order to succeed in that task. We
found out that they can see quite well. These eyes on their backs enable them to see perfectly
well. By the way, here's the optic nerve. You can trace it. It does not go to the brain.
It goes to the spinal cord and then it stops there. Notice what's happened here is that
this animal has a radically different sensory motor architecture. You've got now this weird
itchy patch of tissue on your back that's sending signals to your spinal cord. How does
the brain know that that's visual data and use it? In particular, why doesn't that take
extra evolutionary cycles? Cycles of mutation, selection, it's just ready to roll. You've
drastically changed this architecture that's been the same for millions of years and suddenly
it works. It works because evolution doesn't actually make specific solutions to specific
problems. It makes problem-solving agents. Embryos, as I'll point out in a few minutes,
can't take much for granted. They solve these things on the fly, which is why this works.
What this has to do with collective intelligence is this. We all started life right here as
a single cell. I once pointed out to somebody, I was doing some expert witness work and one
of the attorneys was trying to say that our work in frog was not relevant to humans. He
said, don't frogs come from an egg? I said, will you come from an egg? This was like everybody
thought I was insulting him, the judge banged the thing. Let's remember, we all come from
an egg. We all come from a single cell. That's a little blob of chemistry and physics. That
slowly and gradually gives rise to one of these remarkable morphologies. There is no magic
spot, no lightning flash that says, okay, you wore physics, but now you're a real cognitive
individual. Now, mind comes into the picture. This is slow and gradual. We, then as scientists
and philosophers, do need to understand how does that scaling work? How do you get from a system
that's well-described by chemistry and physics? As I'll mention, actually, not with zero cognitive
capacity. It's small, but it's not zero. How do you get here? Let's remember that we humans with
our magical, agential glow are not discreetly different from all of these other things. We
stand at the intersection of two enormous continuums where you can both both evolutionarily
and developmentally, and then through biological change and through technological change. There
are all kinds of interesting beings that we're going to need to get to know. That's a little
disturbing. A lot of people, they send me emails about how disturbed they are to find out that
they were basically a scale up from a single cell, but at least we're a true unified intelligence.
We're not like a collection of ants or termites or something. You can talk about an ant colony
as a collective intelligence, but we're an actual true unified intelligence, right?
Well, wrong. This is Descartes who really liked the pineal gland, and the reason he liked the
pineal gland is that there's only one of them in the brain. He felt that our unified human
experience should be associated with a structure in the brain that's unique, not bifurcated,
not to like the hemispheres or all these other structures. It should be the only one. Well,
if he had had access to good microscopy, he would have looked inside the pineal gland and
he would have seen that, wait a minute, there's not one of anything. It's made of a bunch of cells.
Each one of these cells has all this stuff in it. Look at this. These are all the things that are
inside of each cell, and there's plenty more. This is only what we know to stain at this point.
All intelligence is collective intelligence. We are all built of a kind of multi-scale agential
material. This is a single cell. This happens to be a free-living organism known as a lacrimaria,
but look, this is what a single cell can do. There's no brain. There's no nervous system.
He's handling all of his local needs, and this is real time, so incredible anatomical,
physiological, and metabolic control, and so on. We're all made of collections of these,
and the thing about being a collective intelligence is that you need cognitive glue.
Now, what I mean by that is, here's a rat that's been trained to press a lever, get a reward.
There is no single cell here that has had both experiences. The cells at the bottom of the feet
interacted with the lever. The cells in the gut got the delicious sugar reward,
but no single cell had both of these experiences, so who owns the associative memory? Who is it
that knows that these two things are tied? It isn't any individual cell. It is the rat.
So, what you need is a set of mechanisms that are able to provide the system with memories,
preferences, goals, and other cognitive properties that the individual parts don't have.
We're used to thinking about ones like this, and creatures like this are fairly,
the rat doesn't change too much, but there are many other creatures that show us something
really remarkable. So, here are some flatworms, some planaria. You can train them. You can train
them to understand that these little bumpy circles that we've laser etched into the bottom of the
dish are where they get fed, so the liver shows up on these little circles. The other amazing
thing about planaria is that they regenerate, so you can cut them into pieces. The record is
something like 276 pieces, and if you cut them in half here, this tail will sit there doing
nothing for about eight days. It'll grow a new head, and then behavior begins, and you find out
that these animals remember the original information. So, the information is not exclusively in the
brain because you can cut off the entire head. It is somewhere else. However, it is imprinted
onto the new brain as it develops, and so you can do all kinds of interesting thought experiments,
like the old malfunctioning transporter, and ask, okay, if we cut them into pieces, who's the original
planaria, and so on. So, right away, you get into these issues of personal identity. You get into
where is behavioral information? How does it move through the body? How does it imprinted onto
new brains? How do brains know how to interpret? Just like I showed you in the tadpole, the brain
knows how to interpret information coming off of its spinal cord. How does this brain know that
whatever the tail is telling it is actually behavioral information that the brain can use?
But it goes even beyond that. It's not just about maintaining the information. Here's one
of my favorite examples. So, here's a caterpillar, two-dimensional. You can model it as a soft-bodied
robot with a particular controller, and that's suitable for moving soft bodies that have no
hard elements, so you can't push on anything. So, these things crawl around, and they eat leaves,
and they have a brain that's well suited for that. They have to turn into this. This is a butterfly
that flies in three-dimensional space. It doesn't eat leaves. It drinks nectar,
and in order to change the brain from this to that, you basically undergo this remarkable
transformation process that dissolves most of the brain. Many of the cells die. Most of the
connections are broken, but what you find out is that if you train the caterpillar to seek out
leaves on a particular color disc, the butterfly will do the same. Now, there's a few amazing things
here. You can ask questions like, what's it like to be a creature in the process of changing so
radically? Questions like that, and you can ask, where is the memory? If the brain is being
refactored, where does it keep those memories? But there's a deeper issue here, which is that
butterflies don't eat the same stuff that caterpillars eat, and they don't move the
same way that caterpillars move. So, having the exact memories of a caterpillar is completely
useless. What it has to do, actually, is interpret whatever the engrams, whatever the memory traces
that the caterpillar leaves, it has to reinterpret them for its new context. So, in its new higher
dimensional life, it doesn't carry the exact memories of its previous life, but it carries the
deep lessons that it's learned. And the trick here is that it has to know how to remap them onto its
own architecture. So, you can read a lot more about this in this preprint that I just put up a
few days ago. So, the interesting thing is that these worms and caterpillars and so on,
we shouldn't just think about them as this sort of bizarre aspect of biology that has nothing
to do with us, because if you think about the slices of our own life at any given moment,
you don't have access to the past. The only thing you have access to are the
the engrams, the traces of past experience that your past self has laid down in your brain,
in your body, in notepads, in various outsourced kinds of things. You have to reinterpret those
memories. At every point, you have to reconstruct actively the story of who you are, what you are,
what your various commitments and beliefs are from the molecules and the energy patterns that
are in your body, and you have to tell a story about what they add up to. This is what our
brain does all the time. One way to think about this is that memories are messages from your past
self, just the way that you exchange messages laterally with other beings at your current
time point. These memories are messages from a past self, and like any act of communication,
you're not actually required to interpret these messages in the way that the sender intended.
You are free to reinterpret them, however, it's best for you. And not only are you free to do
that, you actually have to do that because you will change. Your body will change, the environment
changes. Even for humans, there's turnover. There's molecular turnover and cellular turnover
all the time. So all of these messages have to be turned over. And the way that this works,
you can imagine that these engrams, these memory traces are like this middle node,
this narrow little middle node in what this is probably familiar to many of you, this kind of
architecture that's used like an autoencoder kind of thing where it squeezes down all of the
information that's come before because you don't want it to remember the exact data,
you want it to remember patterns, and then you pass the bottleneck, you want this side to
reinflate those patterns into whatever makes sense on the other end. Biology has this everywhere in
gene regulatory networks and voltage at the center of bioelectrical circuits in biomechanical
networks. This architecture is absolutely everywhere because this is what enables information to
preserve salience, not accuracy, but salience and utility on the other end. Now this will only work
if the two ends of this thing are smart. They have to undertake some effort to interpret
and encode what's going on here. So our bodies are made of a multi-scale competency architecture.
Every level of this is in fact smart in the sense that it has a competency to solve various problems.
So whole bodies of course solve problems in three-dimensional space, various kinds of behaviors,
but your molecular networks, your subcellular organelles, your cellular components, your organs,
tissues, all of these things solve problems in other kinds of spaces. And in fact, one thing
that evolution has done is to pivot some of the same tools and tricks for navigating problem spaces
across these various spaces. So we started off metabolic space and then physiological space and
then genes came along and you could navigate gene expression space and then multicellularity came
along and you could navigate anatomical space, the space of possible large-scale shapes. And then,
of course, brains and muscles showed up and you could do behavioral space and then eventually
linguistic space. And it turns out from some recent work in our group that actually some of the exact
same ideas from navigating these other spaces you can use to help AIs navigate linguistic space and
keep track of a story longer and longer and so on. So Alan Turing, who obviously needs no introduction,
who was very interested in minds and intelligence and different embodiments of intelligence and
machines and so on, he was studying intelligence through reprogrammability, right? He was interested
in programmable hardware and plasticity. Interestingly, he wrote this paper, The Chemical
Basis of Morphogenesis. It's one of the earliest works on the mathematics of how order might arise
in chemical systems like that egg that I showed you. So he was interested, how do you, how does
the egg self-assemble? How do the chemicals assume some sort of order? Now, why would somebody who
was interested in mathematics and computer science and so on be interested in this question?
And I think that he saw a very profound kind of invariance that I think if he had lived longer,
both biology and computer science would be much further along because what he realized was that
the story of the appearance of minds is fundamentally the same story as the story of the self-assembly
of the body, right? The factors that put together your body should be really important for understanding
where minds come from. So let's ask, where do anatomies come from? So you start life as a collection
of embryonic blastomeres. This is a cross-section through an adult human. Look at the amazing
order. All of the organs, they're the right size, the right shape. Everything is next to the correct
thing. Where does this amazing order come from? Where is this pattern written down? And so if you
ask even nine-year-olds, I've given talks to middle schools and they will immediately say,
well, it's in the DNA. It's in the genome. But the thing is that we can read genomes now. And
actually, this was apparent long before, but now we know for sure because we can read genomes.
None of this is directly in the genome. What's in the genome are the specifications of the proteins,
the tiniest hardware, the molecular hardware that cells get to have. This pattern, any more than the
actual structure of the termite colony or the precise pattern of a spider web are not in their
genome. This is not directly in our genome either. Where this comes from is the working out of the
physiological software that this hardware enables. And so we have to ask a number of questions.
Given that DNA specifies the hardware, where does the anatomy come from? How do cells know
what to make and when to stop? If a piece is missing, people like us want to know how do you
repair it? How do you convince them to regrow what they need to regrow? And as engineers,
we also ask, well, what else are they willing to do if we knew how to communicate with them?
And I could do a whole thing here on the anatomical compiler and some of those ideas.
But if we knew how to communicate with these cells, what else would they be willing to build?
And I'm going to show you some of those towards the end of the talk.
Now, one cool thing about this process is that it's not hardwired. This is not simply the emergence
of complexity. This is actually the emergence of intelligence. What kind of intelligence? Well,
goal-directedness of a certain kind in anatomical space. So here, this is an amazing creature,
this axolotl. And they regenerate their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, portions of the brain
and heart and so on. And if they lose a limb, and they do this all the time, they bite each other's
legs off constantly, wherever they lose the limb, the cells will work very hard to build exactly
what's needed, and then they stop. And that's the most amazing thing about this process is they
know when to stop. How do they know when to stop? Well, they stop when the correct axolotl arm has
been completed. It's a process of anatomical homeostasis. If you deviate them from their goal,
they will get right back there, and then they stop. By the way, this is not just for weird
organisms. Mammals are a little bit regenerative. So humans can regenerate their liver.
Kids up to a certain age can regenerate their fingertips. And deer can regenerate bone
and vasculature and innervation up to a centimeter and a half per day of new growth when they're
doing this. So we have some of these capacities, but not terribly much. And I want to show you
one of my favorite examples of this kind of intelligence and what it means to be a being
coming into this world. This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in the in the in the
nude. So normally it's made of eight to 10 cells or so. But one trick you can do is by
increasing the number of nuclei of actually genetic material in these cells, you can make
the cells much larger. So the cells will scale to the amount of genetic material,
but the nude stays the same size. And the only way you can do that is by using fewer cells to
build the same structure. And so the first amazing thing is that you could have extra copies of all
your genetic material. No problems. Everything still works. Second, you can have huge cells,
and you will scale the number appropriately. No problem. The most amazing thing happens when
you make truly enormous cells. And at that point, one cell will just bend around itself and give you
that same lumen. Now this is a completely different molecular mechanism than this. This is cell to
cell communication. This is cytoskeletal bending. So this is top-down causation. In the service of a
particular journey and anatomical space that that this system needs to make, it can use different
tools in its disposal. It can use different molecular tools to get the job done. And we can ask all
kinds of interesting questions about how did it know that that was the thing to do? But just think
about what it means to be a nude coming into this world. You can't depend on anything. Never mind the
environment. Never mind the injury that somebody else might come along and bite your leg off or
something. You can't even count on your own parts. You don't know how many copies of your chromosomes
you're going to have. You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be. You don't know how
many cells you're going to have. You have to come in and on the fly, you have to take this journey
in anatomical space and you can't overtrain on your evolutionary priors. You cannot assume any of
the things that were true in evolution going back. Not just about the environment, but about
yourself. So a very long story, very short. We've been studying how all these things work and what
we basically found out is that the capacities of brains and nervous systems for dealing with novelty,
for intelligence, for navigation, for keeping memories and pursuing goals and all of that,
those capacities are actually incredibly ancient. They're driven by a kind of electrophysiological
software that is produced in the brain by these little ion channels that set voltages and these
voltages can propagate through the network and you get this electrical activity that you can imagine
going on in the brain. But that mechanism is extremely ancient. It's not really specific to
brains at all. Evolution discovered it about the time of bacterial biofilms, so very long ago,
and all cells have these ion channels. Most cells have these electrical synapses.
Your whole body is a giant electrical network that has many of the capacities that your brain has,
but it does them slower. So if you take almost any neuroscience paper and you just do a find
replace, and in fact we made an AI system to do just this for people, it basically flips some
words around. If instead of neuron you say cell and instead of millisecond you say hour, you basically
get a pretty reasonable developmental biology paper about how, whereas your brain thinks about
moving you in three-dimensional and now linguistic space, the rest of your body has been thinking
about how to move you through anatomical space from being an egg to being, you know, whatever we
become. So I just want to show you a small piece of what happens when we understand something like
this. These electrical networks are literally the cognitive medium of the collective intelligence
of your body cells, whereas you are the product of the collective intelligence of your neurons,
your body is the product of the collective intelligence of the rest of your cells
behaving in anatomical space. And when we learn this interface, this bioelectrical interface,
we get access to an API that's very, very powerful. Here's one example, and by the way,
just to say none of this has to do with applied electric fields. There are no electrodes, no magnets,
no waves or frequencies or anything like that. We're hacking the natural interface that cells use
to shape each other's behavior, which is the set of ion channels and gap junctions on their
surface. And so we can, for example, insert some potassium channel proteins here to
create a particular voltage pattern. And that voltage pattern is a signal to these cells,
and what these cells will do is build an eye. This is not like the eye I showed you before,
that was a transplant. This is not like that. We have said to these cells, which normally make a
gut, we've said, here's a particular voltage pattern. It happens to be the same pattern that
they normally use to make an eye, and the cells see it, and they build an eye. And these eyes,
if you section them, have the same lens, retina, optic nerve, all this stuff. Now notice a couple
of interesting things. First of all, like any good subroutine call, we did not have to give it
all the information on how to build an eye. In fact, we don't have any idea of how to build an eye.
We don't know how to talk to all the stem cells, all the genes that are there that have to be
turned on. The eyes are very complex, and we don't want to. We want a high-level stimulus
that prompts the cells to do what they already know how to do. So that's the first thing.
The second thing is, here, this is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere.
The blue cells are the ones that we actually injected with our ion channel, but there's not
enough of them to make an eye. And so what they've done is they've recruited all these other normal
cells to participate with them to be an eye. And in fact, we've studied, there's a conversation
that happens. These blue cells acquire a new belief. They believe that they should be an eye,
and they tell all the other cells, hey, you should be working with us to make an eye.
These other cells, actually, what are they saying? They're saying, no, we should be skin or gut or
whatever. And so they have this back-and-forth conversation, and sometimes these guys win,
and you get an eye, and sometimes the rest of the cells win, and they ignore us and stay whatever
tissue they're supposed to be. There are other collective intelligences like ants that do this
when two ants or a couple of ants discover something that it's too big for them to carry by
themselves. They recruit their neighbors. So all these competencies, this ability to hold a goal
in anatomical space, to try to convince others of your goal, to get buy into your story about what
should happen, and sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose that battle, all of these are native
competencies of the tissue. We didn't have to build in any of that. It's already there. And in the
planaria, I told you that they regenerate, and if you cut off the head and the tail, this middle
piece will reliably regenerate this normal worm with the right number of heads. Here's the bioelectric
pattern memory. This is now, we're literally seeing the memories. Think of it as a brain scan,
except not in the brain. We're literally seeing the representations in this tissue of how many
heads a normal planarian should have. So we can go ahead and change them. We have the technology,
instead of one head, we can say, no, you should have two heads. And here's a perfectly normal
animal whose tissues, not the animal itself, not the brain, but the tissues have been
incepted with a new memory that says that if you should get cut in the future,
so this is a counterfactual, it's not true now, but if you get cut in the future, a proper worm
should have two heads. And so if you cut that worm, this is what you get. And again, not Photoshop,
these are real. So a single worm body, a perfectly normal and anatomically normal worm body can store
at least two different ideas of what it will do in the future if it should happen to get injured.
And the reason I call this a pattern memory, I mean, it's a memory of the collective intelligence
of the body. The reason I call it a memory is because if you then go ahead and you cut these
two headed worms in perpetuity, they maintain two headedness with no more change. And so this has
all the properties of memory, it's stable, but it's rewritable. By the way, not genetic, we haven't
touched the genetics, the genetics are completely untouched. So the question of where is the anatomy
of this, the answer, the genome is not really the right answer. Yes, the genome encodes hardware
that by default will say one head, but that hardware is reprogrammable. And here you can have these
nice, you can push it into this other state. And by the way, you could push it into a state
belonging to other species. So this nice triangular headed planarian can make flat heads like a
pifalina, round heads like an S Mediterranean, this hardware, again, with no genetic change,
this is just by altering the bioelectrical patterns that serve as the memory here,
they will visit these other attractors in the anatomical state space where these other creatures
normally live about 100 to 150 million years of evolutionary distance. But that's okay, this
hardware can visit there if pushed. And of course, not just the shape of the head, but actually the
shape of the brain, the distribution of stem cells are all the same, like these other species.
So what we're seeing here is the, first of all, the hardware, software distinction in biology,
the reprogrammability of biology, the API, once you understand how the cognitive glue works that
binds individual cells into a more global vision of what they should be doing,
now you can start communicating with it, rewriting goals, and really collaborating with the material.
This is, you know, I do a whole other talk on engineering with agential materials. This is not
metal and Legos, this is an agential material, you're a collaborator with that material,
you're not micromanaging it. So let's think about where these cells come from. So here's a
blastoderm, let's say it's, you know, 10 or 50,000 cells in the beginning, we look at that and we
say, oh, that's one embryo. What are we counting when we say that's one embryo? What is there really
one of? But what we're really counting is stories. We're counting how many different stories there
are in this tissue that the cells are committed to as far as where they're going to go in anatomical
space. We're counting commitment and they're aligned. All of these, under normal circumstances,
all of these cells are aligned, they're, they've bought into one single story and this is what
they're going to build. That's what we mean when we say there's one embryo. You might ask a similar
question in the brain, if I showed you a human brain and you didn't know what a human was, you
could ask, so how many individual cells fit here? Like, what's the density of cells per, you know,
per unit volume of this, of this medium? And computers, we kind of have some idea of how
much information fits into a certain number of transistors or whatnot, but, but, but here we
actually don't know. And the amazing thing is that if you, if you take this early embryonic
blastoderm, use a needle to scratch, put some scratches into it, and I used to do this in
duck embryos when I was a grad student. What happens is that each of these little islands
doesn't feel the presence of the others for a while until it heals up. And so it goes and,
and self-organizes an embryo. And then you get conjoint twins like this, you can get triplets,
you can get all sorts of things. And so a couple of interesting things here. First of all, the
number of individuals that come out of this excitable medium is not known in advance. It's
certainly not determined by the genetics. It could be zero, one, probably up to half a dozen.
So how many cells, how many individuals are really in there? Well, you don't know until they
self-organize. And that process of self-organization is critical. One of the things they have to do
is determine boundaries. Where do I end and the outside world begins? Or in this case,
some other embryo begins. Actually, some of the cells at this intersection are a little confused.
That's why in conjoint twins, one of the twins will often have a laterality defect. We actually
figured out why in the 96 for the first time. Why conjoint twins tend to have a laterality
flipping in one of the twins? It's because these cells can't quite tell, am I the right side of
this guy or am I the left side of this guy? But overall, they have to establish their boundaries.
And the analogy to the brain is actually still apropos, because we have lots of examples of
split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders, all of these kinds of things where
it's entirely not obvious that our brain is host to just one coherent self. And so one way that
I've been working on to start thinking about how to understand beings, goal-directed beings,
in very different embodiments is to put aside the question of what you're made of or whether you
were engineered or evolved, and really just to ask about the size of your goals. What's the largest
goal you're capable of pursuing? And so that gives rise to this idea of a cognitive light cone.
It's kind of like a Minkowski cone, except a little bit upside down. And so if you collapse a
space onto this axis and time onto this axis, you can see that different kinds of creatures
can have different scopes to the goals that they can conceive of. I mean, humans actually
may be uniquely, their cognitive light cone is bigger than their own lifespan. And that may
provide some for some interesting psychological pressures. If you're a goldfish, you may have
some goals 20 minutes into the future, but those goals are probably pretty achievable. It's very
likely that you will live for the next 20 minutes. So, you know, all your goals are achievable. For
many humans, they know their goals are guaranteed not achievable because they can see and commit to
goals that are bigger than their known lifespan. So for now anyway, this is something that makes
humans kind of unique. And then of course, we are all compound bodies of lots of little subunits
that have their own goals in various spaces that compete, cooperate and interact with each other.
Now, this has that kind of this crazy way of thinking about things as this cognitive light
cone has clinical implications. And I like this not just because I want to make advances in
biomedicine, but also because this is how we know that some of this philosophizing is actually on
the right track. So this is the tiny cognitive light cone of a single cell. All it really cares
about is its local, you know, the state's locally here. But what evolution did is scale it up
via sort of mechanisms that I haven't really had time to talk about, but bioelectricity is one of
them. It's now the cognitive light cone is huge. It's the size of this whole limb. Each all of
these cells, they're not pursuing their own local agendas, they're pursuing this triangle. But that
has a failure mode. And that failure mode is cancer. So once individual cells disconnect from
the network, they roll back to their unicellular cells. They can't conceive of these grandiose
goals anymore. All they can remember is proliferate as much as you can and eat as much as you can
and go wherever life is good. And that is that this is a human glioblastoma. That's cancer.
And so one of the things you might do then is on this weird way of looking at things is instead
of targeting the genes or worried about being worried about genetic defects or trying to kill
these cells with toxic chemotherapy, you might say, well, what if we just forcibly reconnect them to
the rest of the organism? So here's a tadpole injected with a human oncogene. And the bioelectric
imaging already tells you, yeah, here's the first thing that happens when these cells transform
is they disconnect electrically from the rest of the body. They acquire this aberrant voltage
pattern. And if we co-inject an ion channel, it doesn't doesn't kill the cells. In fact,
you can see here the the red is the oncoprotein. It's very strong. In fact, it's all over the
place. This is the same animal. There's no tumor because because even though the hardware of these
guys is is a little screwy, because they've got this this this oncoprotein, they're being forced
informationally to be part of this continuum. And that that causes them to be part of a collective
intelligence that just builds nice organs. Now, again, we're able to do all this make
eyes and normalize tumors and induce like regeneration and animals that don't regenerate
and so on. Not because we're so smart or we're doing some kind of crazy synthetic biology,
all we're doing is hacking the native competency of the tissue. And by the way, oh, and one other
thing I wanted to say is that these cancer cells are not more selfish than normal cells. There's a
lot of game theory that models cancer is being more selfish. I don't think they're more selfish.
I think they have smaller selves. So you can be as selfish as you want as long as your your
cognitive light cone is large enough to encompass many possibly all beings and then and then you
know, then then then it's fine. So there's this this issue and this is something that that Bill
and our other collaborators are actually working on this this notion of increasing the cone of
compassion outwards. So the interesting thing about us engineering all this is that we are not
the only bioengineers. This is another this is a non human bioengineer and look this is a this is
an oak leaf and you might think that well acorns always make oak trees and these leaves we know
what the oak genome does right it makes these flat green things but but here comes this bioengineer
doesn't change the genome the hardware is perfectly capable. You don't need to rewire it.
I don't have to explain to this crowd why you know you don't use a soldering iron when you want to
go from PowerPoint to Microsoft Word on your laptop. This animal takes advantage of exactly that
which is that it lays down some signals that prompt the cells to build something completely
different. This is made of the of the plant cells not the not the not the animal. Would we have any
idea that these cells are capable of building something like this or like this right if we
hadn't done this we would not and so for that reason in our lab we make a number of synthetic
creatures to really test the plasticity the the the ability of these of the of the hardware to
undergo novel novel scenarios and this is that we call these xenobots because what what happens
here is that some some skin cells are harvested from the top of a frog embryo they self-assemble
into this little thing which I think is a biorebotics platform and we are interested in knowing
where their goals come from so here you can see they swim they can go in circles they can patrol
back and forth they have collective behaviors here's one going through through a maze so it
comes down this this arm of the maze over here it's going to take a turn without bumping into
the opposite wall so it takes a turn and at this point due to some internal mech who knows why it
turns around and goes back where it came from. Remember this is just skin okay there's no
there's no nervous system there's nothing in there one amazing thing they do is kinematic
replication so if you provide them with loose skin cells they will run around and combine them
into these little these little piles and work them and polish them and because they're working with
an agential material for the same reason we were able to do this not because we know how to how to
change the way these cells behave but we liberated them into a new context and these little piles
mature into the next generation of xenobots and guess what they do they run around and they make
the next generation and the next this is basically von Neumann's dream of a of a robot that makes copies
of itself from materials it finds in the environment and so if you ask what does a frog genome know
well it certainly knows how to do this how to make this developmental the hardware that goes
through this developmental sequence and and then has these these kind of behaviors there's some
tadpoles but apparently it also can do this and the amazing thing is that there's never been any
xenobots there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good xenobot where did all this
come from why is there this weird developmental stage of this xenobot this is an 80 year old
80 day old xenobot it's changing into something we have no idea what they have their own behaviors
they do this kinematic replication that no one else as far as we know no other organism does
so so this is really the thing when when you make or when you facilitate novel collective
intelligences that have never been here before and that includes financial structures social
structures internet of things who knows we we make these things all the time we really don't
know where where their goals come from what their goals are going to be what their capacity for
problem solving is going to be we need to understand and lest you think that this is some
special i mean these these cells come from an amphibian they come from an embryo you might
think amphibians are plastic embryos are pretty plastic this is probably some some crazy embryonic
cell thing well here is this little creature if i asked you what you thought this was you might
think we got it off the bottom of a pond somewhere if you were to sequence its genome you would see
100% homo sapiens this is these are human cells they come from an adult human patient no embryo
stuff adult human tracheal epithelial cells they make something we call anthrobots we this is a
type of agential intervention because these anthrobots remarkably we found a novel capability
the capability is and i'm sure there are many others it's just the first thing we found
is that if you played a bunch of human neurons and you scratch them so you make a wound right here
these anthrobots will traverse down the wound and when they settle down what they'll do is
they start knitting the two sides together they heal this this this neural defect and so
who would have known that your tracheal cells which sit there quietly in your airway for decades
if you if you take them out and you let them have a new life reboot their multicellularity have a new
life in the new environment they become this little motile creature that can run around by the way
can be injected back into your body there's no immune suppression needed because it's your own
cells it shares all the priors with your own tissues about what health and disease are what cancer
is what inflammation is and among other things what they can do is they can actually repair neural
defects and so so that's just kind of the biomedical side of things but but more fundamentally
and I'm just about done I know I'm over time a couple minutes just fundamentally what we see
is that what I think these are and this is not a this is not the conventional you know view of my
colleagues I don't think but but what I think we're looking at in all of these examples is vehicles
for exploring a platonic space or a latent space of possibilities when we ask where do the shape
and behavior of xenobots of anthrobots of other chimeras and the weird things that we make
where do they come from well evolutionary selection is not where they come from
and I think that what normal embryos do is exploit a little pinprick at one single point
of interface between this platonic space and the physical world and you get your standard reliable
body but but what we can do is we can start to enlarge these little holes by making anthrobots
and xenobots and other things we can start making holes and and looking around and starting to
understand the structure of that space what else is out there I I really think that what
we're studying here is is the structure of this of the space that's around us and and still very
poorly understood so just just a couple things to to finish up here first of all here's what I
think the biology teaches us everything is going to change your body is going to change your parts
the environment everything is going to change it's futile to try to hold on to specific details
and in particular biology uses an extremely unreliable material everything is within within a
cell is going to go bad there's there's huge amounts of noise it's it's exactly the opposite of what
we do in computers where we make very reliable parts and we try to insulate each level from the
level below you know you you just sort of assume the level below is going to work and then and
then that's how we program that is the opposite of what biology does biology assumes the material
is going to go wrong in a million ways whether you're a genome whether you're a genome that has
to be reinterpreted by the species as it changes you know your parts are going to change you're
going to be mutated and your environment will change you have to reinterpret it brains do the
same as they change over time they reinterpret their memories intelligence is everywhere that's
because the only way to do this kind of this kind of thing this committing to salience as opposed to
accuracy means that intelligence has to be everywhere every part of the body has to be able
to reinterpret uh confabulate tell stories new stories about what it saw and and what information
it has to solve whatever the the new problems are this is poly computing which which josh barngaard
and i work out work on the idea that biology has is is just a huge collection of systems
which interpret and reinterpret each other's computations in different ways the exact same
computation means different things to different observers so it's an observer focused view you
can't say what is it really computing and from that perspective each self is a is a a dynamic
construction it's an ongoing process of sense making of your own memories and the environment
and it's self-reinforcing these are these are these are basically points of view these are
self-reinforcing continuously modifying points of view that seek to perpetuate themselves by
making sense of whatever's going on now and this is this is a very deep idea from william james
where he said thoughts are the thinkers if we sort of dissolve the idea of the distinction between
data and machine right and we and we think that the pattern itself is actually helping
construct its niche so it's constructing the cognitive system within which it will prosper
then then all of us are really very complex bundles of of thoughts that have sort of closed
the loop and learn to contribute to their own persistence within various physical cognitive
systems and because biology is so interoperable because biology solves all of this on the fly it
doesn't doesn't assume anything pretty much any combination of evolved material designed or engineered
material and software is some kind of viable agent so we already have some cyborgs and we're
going to have lots more in there hybrids and chimeras and all kinds of just different bodies
and minds where all of darwin's endless forms most beautiful on earth are a tiny little dot in this
enormous option space of new bodies and new minds so so these um with the so the need now for a new
ethical synthbiosis is clear this this old idea that we can decide how we're going to relate to
something based on what does it look like and how did it get here did it come from a factory or
was it naturally evolved by the random processes of evolution those two criteria are going to be
out the window we're going to have to deal with beings that are nowhere on the tree of life with
us that don't offer us easy answers the way that for example current ai's do when you know you can
you can kind of distinguish them strongly from from biology but but boy we're going to be surrounded
by by beings that are composites and and none of those answers will be so so trivial and uh this is
jeremy gay um is an amazing graphic artist who drew this for me this is kind of a new version of
adam uh and the uh and the garden of eden because we've got our job cut out for us but it's a it's
going to be an amazing journey because we are finally going to i hope uh get better at detecting
and and and relating to very diverse minds all around us so i'm going to stop here if you're
interested in any of this stuff it's discussed in various papers here these are the people i want
to thank a number of postdocs and phd students that did the work that i showed you today lots of our
collaborators these are the the people who fund us on disclosures so these are three spin-off
companies for my group that have funded our work and most thanks of all to the actual
animals that we deal with so um yeah that's it thank you so much for listening
you
