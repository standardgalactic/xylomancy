Okay, so it's a great pleasure today for me to introduce Professor Michael Levin.
He's a Distinguished Professor at Tufts University as well as the Vannevar Bush Professor and
he's also Director of the Allen Discovery Center and the Tufts Center for Regenerative
and Developmental Biology.
And I'm sure everyone here have heard about his work on Xenobots, which I've been told
there'll be some of that at the end of his talks.
So Michael has requested that we refrain from asking deep questions until the end.
So just clarification questions throughout the talk so that we can get to the really
exciting parts.
Okay, so take it away.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
And thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you.
All of the details and if you would like to contact me, which would be great, you can
find me at these two websites.
So what I want to talk about today is our sort of perspective on collective intelligence
and in particular cellular behavior as a kind of collective intelligence.
So I often start by thinking about Alan Turing, who of course needs no introduction, was very
interested in intelligence, in cognition and various embodiments, and in particular in
problem-solving machines, this idea that intelligence can be manifest through plasticity or reprogrammability
and so we all know that.
Some people may or may not know that he was also interested in morphogenesis, the generation
of biological shape.
And it's often, one might wonder, why would the same person who was interested in intelligence
be interested in the kinds of questions that biologists tend to, developmental biologists
in particular tend to deal with.
And I think he saw a very deep symmetry between these two fields, which is I think very important
and still not really appreciated sufficiently.
So this is what we work on.
In particular, the idea of problem-solving living machines.
And one thing that we have to think about as we drill down in the biology and we look
to see what we are all made of is this idea that this traditional distinction between,
we look at things like termite mounds and bee colonies and blard flocks and we say, okay,
that's perhaps a kind of collective intelligence, but we are true sort of centralized intelligences.
And of course, the idea is that actually all intelligence, certainly in biology as well
as collective intelligence, because we are all made of parts and components.
And in fact, Riccardo Sole calls this kind of thing a liquid brain in the sense that
the components are not fixed with respect to their spatial relationships.
So this is the sort of thing of which we are made.
This is a single cell.
This is called a lacrimaria.
Of course, this is a free-living organism.
It's one cell.
It has no brain.
It has no nervous system.
It is extremely competent in its local sort of environment with its local goals.
So it's physiological.
It's anatomical.
It's behavioral goals.
It's very competent without the typical things that we associate with intelligence.
And the really critical part is to realize is that all of us make this amazing journey
from what people call just physics to cognition.
So we were all at one point a quiescent oocyte, so a little pile of chemicals doing something
like this where specific molecules interact with other molecules.
But eventually, through this process of embryonic development, we become something like this
or maybe even something like that.
And so the thing about this process is that it's extremely slow and gradual.
There is no special point at which a magic lightning flash sort of says, okay, now you
are cognitive.
Before that, you were just physics.
In chemistry, now you are a true cognitive individual.
That doesn't happen.
So we need to understand this scale up.
We need to understand what happens from the time that we are this to the time that we
are that.
So the main points today that I would like to talk about is this idea of biology's multi-scale
competency architecture, which is a set of nested problem solvers in different spaces.
And one kind of invariant to all of this is navigation.
I want to spend the most of my time on this example, although there are many other examples,
of anatomical control, and specifically this idea of navigating morphospace.
And I will talk a lot about bioelectrical networks as not only the mediator of kind
of the glue that binds neurons together into a coherent emergent intelligence, but also
of a much more ancient roles for that same mechanism.
And this has many applications, for example, on biomedicine.
And at the end, I want to talk a little bit about synthetic bioengineering, and I want
to show you some novel creatures that have never existed before, and talk a little bit
about what this means for evolution and for many other fields.
So single cells come in all shapes and sizes.
This is a single cell.
So this is a diatom.
They are very tiny.
So this is a single cell.
This is also a single cell.
This thing, which looks like a plant, it has a nice cap and a stalk and some roots here.
It's actually an alga.
The whole thing could be up to 10 centimeters in size.
It's also a single cell.
So if you're interested in morphogenesis by differentiating cells into different types,
we already start to see that, well, actually, there's structure well below that.
This thing has one nucleus, and it manages to make this amazing shape without any differentiation.
Cells are also competent in behavioral spaces.
So what you're looking at here, this is a slime mold called physarum polycephalum.
It has many nuclei, but it's still one cell.
The whole thing is one cell.
And what you can do is you can do this.
You can put some objects in its vicinity.
These white things are glass discs.
They have no chemical on them, no food, nothing.
They're completely inert.
And if you put three on one side and one on the other, it will consistently choose to
travel towards the three.
What it's actually doing, as we showed in this paper, is it's actually sensing strain
angle in the medium.
It is incredibly sensitive to it.
And it's pulsing, which you can't see here, but it's pulsing as a kind of sonar to build
a map of its surroundings and migrate towards the heavier object.
And what's kind of cool is that at this point here, for the first four hours, it sort of
grows in all directions.
And this is the point at which it's got enough information.
And now, boom, now it knows where to go at that point.
But right here, you still can't really, you don't really know.
But at this point, bang, it starts to.
So there are all sorts of.
So this is kind of the field of basal cognition and trying to understand how biology was solving
various problems long before brains and neurons appeared.
So I want to talk about three or four things today.
The first thing I want to do is I want to twist some knobs on traditional cognitive
science and talk about some unconventional agents that we can start thinking about.
So this kind of picture, right, this is the classic painting of Adam naming the animals
in the Garden of Eden.
This kind of picture is really pretty prevalent in a lot of discussions in the sense that
people really think about finished adult organisms as the subjects of their study.
So intelligence, they say the human brain or the rat or something like this.
And what I want to do is stretch this in a number of dimensions, both in terms of the
time evolution, the fact that everything comes from one cell at one point.
And also the fact that drawing boundaries between different types of creatures is actually
very difficult because of the interoperability of life and the ability to make chimeras.
So the first thing we can think about is this.
This is a caterpillar.
This is a kind of soft-bodied robot that crawls around and it chews plants and it lives in
a two-dimensional world.
It has to turn into this.
This is a completely different hard-bodied kind of creature which has to fly in a three-dimensional
world.
It doesn't care about leaves anymore, but it does want nectar.
And so the behavioral and all of these repertoires are completely different.
So during this time, what happens is the brain basically liquefies.
Most of the connections are broken.
Most of the neurons die.
It gets reassembled and rebuilt into a brand new brain suitable for driving, this kind
of creature.
And one of the most amazing things is, and there are many examples that you can read
about here, is that if you train this animal to have particular memories, those memories
are recovered in the moth or butterfly that comes out.
So despite the complete rewiring of the brain here, those memories remain.
So as computer scientists, we can start thinking about, okay, what kind of medium could we
have that is able to store information that survives radical remodeling of the structure
of the medium?
But this metamorphosis is very interesting because this is not just evolutionary timescales.
This is a single individual.
So if you're into philosophy of mind and you wonder what's it like to be a caterpillar
or a butterfly, here's kind of the next level question.
What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly?
What is the experience of this process as your cognitive medium is being completely reshaped?
Biology goes even further.
These are plenaria.
These are flatworms.
You'll hear lots more about them later.
Interesting thing about them, well, several interesting things.
One is that you can cut them into pieces and every piece regenerates and becomes a completely
normal worm.
But what you could, and so they have a true brain, all the same neurotransmitters that
you and I have centralized nervous system.
What you can do is you can train them to expect food on these little laser-etched kind of
a bumpy surfaces, cut off their heads.
The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days and then they regrow a brand new brain
and then you find out that the animal actually remembers where to find the food.
So the memory survives complete decapitation.
So the interesting thing about that is, okay, somehow it's stored in the rest of the tissue.
Maybe neural, maybe not neural, we don't know, fine.
But also that information has to be imprinted onto the new brain that is constructed from
scratch.
So this idea of moving information around and what happens to cognitive information as
anatomical information is being processed is really interesting, right?
That's the nexus at which we do most of our work.
And so now, finally, I want to show you an example.
This bears on some of the evolutionary topics where this is a tadpole of a frog.
So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, here's the gut, here's the
tail.
Now you'll notice something very strange is that here with the eyes should be here, but
they're missing.
Instead, there's one on the tail.
And we engineered it this way and I can talk later about how that's done.
But the interesting thing is that when you make a tadpole with an eye on its tail, despite
the fact that for millions of years, everything was perfectly set up to expect visual input
from two regions right here into the optic tectum, these animals can see quite well.
So we can do a test, we made a machine that tests their learning and visual assays.
This eye, in fact, makes an optic nerve.
It synapses on the spinal cord, not on the brain.
And that apparently is sufficient for the brain to recognize this.
So you can imagine this weird sort of information bus onto which this organ is putting some
sort of data and the brain says, oh yes, I know what that is.
That's visual data, even though it's coming in from a completely bizarre location.
No problem, right?
So that kind of plasticity is going to be a major theme today because one of the things
that I think is a constant theme in biology is that it does not over-train on priors,
meaning that it plays the hands that it's dealt at any given moment, what evolution
is making is hardware that is very good at dealing with a novelty because it doesn't
actually have exact expectations and we'll get to some of that later.
So the interesting thing, what I think makes all of that work, which of course is very
challenging, we were still struggling to make technology like that, what makes all this
work is this multi-scale competency architecture where not only is biology nested dolls kind
of at the structural level, that's obvious, everybody knows that, but actually, not only
functionally, but computationally, every level is solving different problems in their own
space.
And so I've been working on a framework, which I don't have time to really get into the details,
but if anybody's interested, I can give you a link, that is going to enable us to think
about very diverse intelligences, not only the kinds of things that people typically
think about, but also to weird creatures, colonial swarms and bacterial mats and engineered
new life forms and AIs and maybe alien life forms, whatever.
And it's based in part on this kind of approach where, and this is from an old paper in the
40s about setting up a scale of cognitive sophistication all the way from very simple
to quite advanced, with the idea being that there's nothing here about nerves and brains
and whatnot, it's a cybernetic approach that's very substrate independent and I think that's
really important as we start to come up with frameworks that are really enable us to, for
example, recognize alien intelligences.
So what we think about is competency in diverse spaces.
Now the thing that human beings are very good at is recognizing intelligence of medium sized
objects moving at medium speeds through three dimensional space.
All our sense organs are sort of pointed that way, we're good at recognizing that.
So we know when crows and things are doing intelligent navigation of three dimensional
space.
But actually life is navigating all kinds of really interesting spaces, so there's the
space of possible gene expressions and there's the space of possible physiological states
and then there's this which we'll spend the most time talking about which is morpho space.
This is the space of possible anatomical configurations.
So what I want to do next is talk about morphogenesis, the generation of body structure as the behavior
of a collective intelligence of cells in this morpho space.
So we want to think a little bit differently here.
So let's ask a fundamental question.
This is a cross section through a human torso.
Look at this amazing order, all of this, the tissues, the organs, everything is in exactly
the right place, the right orientation, relative to the right size.
Where does this structure come from?
You would think that it would take an incredible amount of information to specify all this.
And by the way, what would that information even look like?
What would the encoding and decoding be?
Because we all start life like this as a collection of embryonic plastomeres.
Now people, so I ask where is this information and people intuitively nowadays will say well,
it's in the DNA, it's in the genome.
But we can read genomes now and we know what's in the genome.
What's in the genome are protein sequences, the specification of a micro level hardware
that every cell gets to have.
There's nothing in the genome directly about any of this.
And so there's really a very deep set of questions about how does the cellular collective
know what to make?
How does it know when to stop?
If a piece is missing as regenerative medicine workers, we would like to know how to convince
the cells to build it again.
And as engineers, and we'll get to this in the last part of the talk, we might ask well,
what else is possible given those exact same cells?
What else can we get them to build with the same hardware?
And so the reason that this kind of question is important is this.
In addition to all the basic stuff, you know, for the biology audiences, I always point
out that pretty much every aspect of medicine with the exception of infectious disease,
everything else, birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease,
all of this would be completely solved if we knew how to tell collections of cells what
to build.
If we could specify what three dimensional structure we wanted the cells to build, all
of this would go away.
And so we can think about the future where this is kind of the end game for this whole
field is what we really want is a kind of anatomical compiler.
We want to sit down and draw the animal or plant that we want, not at the level of gene
pathways or anything like that.
You want to be able to draw the final goal here.
I want a three-headed platform like this and with this kind of nervous system.
This is what I want.
And if we knew what we were doing, this compiler would take that description and convert it
to a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly
that.
Now, we don't have anything remotely like this despite all the incredible progress in
genetics and biology.
Why not?
Well, here's one simple example.
This is a baby axolotl.
So axolotls are kind of salamander.
This is a baby axolotl.
Baby axolotls have legs.
This is the tadpole of a frog.
Frogs don't have legs.
Now, one of the things you can make is you can make a chimeric embryo.
We call it a frogolotl.
We're making these in our lab.
And so I would pose this challenge.
We have the genome for the axolotl.
We have the genome for the frog.
You have all the genetic information.
Now, I ask a simple question.
Will frogolotls have legs or not?
And there are no models in the field that will help you answer that question, none.
Because even though we know a lot about the molecular pathways that are involved at the
cellular level, we really don't understand very well how large-scale decisions are made.
And in particular, not only can't we tell what the chimer is going to do, to be honest,
we can't even tell what the individual is going to do.
If you didn't already know what an axolotl was or you were able to compare that genome
to other genomes, you would have no idea what the shape or the other properties of the animal
were by looking at the genome.
So where we are is this in biology.
We're very good at this kind of thing.
We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules and getting this kind of information.
What we really want is something like this.
We would like to be able to control large-scale anatomy.
And to me, it reminds me of where computer science was a long time ago, where really
one of the things you had to do was you always had to interact at the hardware level.
So you would rewire the thing to get it to do something different.
This is where modern molecular medicine is.
All of the exciting approaches are CRISPR genome editing.
It's basically this.
It's trying to manipulate the absolute lowest level.
And I think we can do way better than that because evolution doesn't do this.
Evolution exploits these amazing higher-level interfaces that we can now exploit as well,
that give you access to all kinds of computation, modularity, and all kinds of other interesting
things.
So one of the things that we're interested in is a degree of intelligence.
And by intelligence, I don't mean, of course, human-level intelligence.
I mean something along the lines of that cybernetic kind of scale that Wiener gave us.
And William James agreed.
He said that intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal by different means.
So this is, again, a very substrate-independent kind of functional definition.
And so what I want to talk about in terms of this anatomy is this idea of an anatomical
morphospace.
So it's a virtual space of possible anatomical configurations.
This is a simple example.
These are snail shells.
And every kind of a shell can be generated by an equation with three parameters, so you
can build a three-dimensional kind of space.
And every existing snail shell is somewhere in this space.
And then there are lots of regions, and we can sort of argue about why those regions
aren't populated by real organisms and so on.
And so let's think about how much, if any, intelligence does a collection of cells happen
navigating this morphospace.
Well, here's the very kind of simplest thing you can do is you can take an early embryo,
you can cut it in half, and what you don't get are two half bodies.
What you actually get are two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
So you start to get this idea that development is reliable, but it isn't hardwired because
if you introduce changes, it can still get to where it's going.
So there are a variety of starting states.
There are some local minima, but what it knows how to do is get around and get to a correct
final state.
This is being cut in half is not the normal state of affairs for embryos, but no problem.
They can still get there even when half the cells are missing.
Now this is a regeneration, which works in a similar fashion.
There's our axolotl.
Axolotls regenerate their eyes, their limbs, their jaws, which is absolutely amazing.
And so what you can do is you can cut this limb anywhere along the length.
It will build exactly what's missing, no more, no less, and then it stops.
That's maybe the most amazing part of this process is this idea that it actually knows
when to stop.
When does it stop?
Well, it stops when a correct salamander arm has been produced.
So this is some kind of means and thing going on here where when the error is low enough,
that's when it stops.
And by the way, humans, of course, are not like axolotls, but we can regenerate something.
So the liver is highly regenerative.
Human children regenerate their fingertips, below a certain age, and deer regenerate huge
amounts of bone and vasculature and innervation every year.
So you can think about some of these examples.
Now the other kind of competency that these cells have is really amazing, which is that
I've shown you that as an embryo, you can't count on how many cells you have.
So you have to be able to produce embryogenesis even when behalf of your cells are missing.
But it turns out you can't even count on how much DNA you have or how big your cells are.
So one thing you can do, this is kind of one of my favorite examples.
This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule in a nuke, and normally it's 8 to 10 cells
and they sort of work together to build this kind of tube, and here's a cross-section
through that.
What you can do, you can do this trick where early on in development you can prevent the
cells from dividing for a bit, the DNA accumulates, every cell ends up with multiple copies of
the genome, and then you let it go, and then development proceeds, but the cells are now
much larger, they're huge.
And so no problem, despite the fact that you have too many copies of all your instructions
in every cell, and the cells are huge, what will happen is a smaller number of those cells
will work together to give you exactly the same structure, so they adjust to the cell
size.
But even better than that.
If you make the cells truly gigantic by having eight times the amount of DNA in the original
egg, what will happen is one cell will bend around itself, leaving a hole in the middle,
and give you the exact same tubule.
Now what's cool about this is that this is top-down causation.
This is the idea that cells will choose different molecular mechanisms to get the same job done
at the anatomical level.
So in service of getting the same large-scale structure, here what the cells are harnessing
are cell-to-cell communication, here what they're harnessing is cytoskeletal bending,
completely different molecular mechanisms to get to the same step.
So the idea is that this hardware that evolution has given us is able to make up for drastic
changes of its component parts.
And the final example, and so that last example was known since the 40s, it was discovered
a long time ago, this is recent, here this is our work, and it's just a simple example
of this kind of navigating morphospace.
So here's your tappel here, now this one has normal eyes, this is a normal tappel, and
it becomes a normal frog.
But in order to do that, it has to rearrange its face, so the jaws have to move, the eyes
have to move forward, the nostrils have to extend, like everything has to move.
The traditional way of thinking about this was that, well, somehow the genome encodes
some hard-wired cell behaviors so that every tissue moves the right direction in the right
amount, and then you get your normal frog from the normal starting position.
So we wanted to test this hypothesis, and we thought that actually, no, probably it's
much more clever than that.
So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tappels.
So everything is in the wrong place, the eyes are in the side of the head, the mouth is
on top, everything is scrambled.
And the amazing thing is that these scrambled tappels still become pretty normal frogs, because
all of these organs starting off at the incorrect position will move around until they get to
where they're going, in fact sometimes they go too far and actually have to double back,
everything will move around until it lands in this correct orientation and then it stops.
So what evolution actually gave us is some kind of an error minimization scheme that
is able to make up for drastic defects.
This has massive implications for evolution because it means that if you have mutations
that move your mouth off kilter or move your eye to your tail or do some kind of crazy
thing like this, it isn't necessarily the end, and if they have other kinds of positive
implications elsewhere in the body now you get to explore those, because these organs
are fairly competent in getting where they need to go, connecting up in the however they
need to connect up and giving you some kind of functionality, it tends to smooth the evolutionary
landscape by a massive amount.
So this whole kind of homeostatic process suggests that this basic emergent story that
molecular biology tells in the textbooks, basically that the standard view of things
is that it's a feed-forward emergent process, basically that there are genes interacting
with each other, some of them make proteins that do things, they're sticky or they diffuse
or something, so this is physics, and then there's this process of emergence, so simple
rules executed in parallel over massive amounts of tiny agents give you an emergent outcome,
and this is true, of course this is true, all of this does happen, but I think it's massively
incomplete because one of the problems with this feed-forward kind of story is that
in addition to evolutionary issues, if you as an engineer or a bio worker in regenerative medicine,
if you wanted to make a change up here, and this was truly a feed-forward process,
you would have no idea what to do back here, because reversing this is impossible, this is a
terrible inverse problem, and if you decided that you know I like this ax a little bit,
it's missing a leg, or instead I want it to be a three-fold symmetry instead of bilateral
symmetry, what genes would you change? We have absolutely no idea how to reverse this, I don't
think it's a solvable problem, and as a result the gains of things like genomic editing and crisper
and so on, I think are going to hit a glass ceiling because for the vast majority of problems,
we don't know what to do down here, so what we focus on in our group is these feedback loops,
the idea that what's actually going on here is that there are systems that measure error,
they measure deviation from a set point, and then they activate both at the genetic level and at
the level of physics, and this is what we'll talk about for the next bit, they try to get you closer
to your set point. Now on the one hand, biologists of course know all about homeostasis and set
points, pretty clear, but there are two weird things going on here, one is that the set point,
unlike a typical biological set point, which might be metabolic level or pH or temperature or
something like that, this is a complex data structure, this is some kind of anatomical descriptor
of what this thing is supposed to look like, how do you store that kind of set point?
The other thing is that it suggests that this whole system in a certain sense is goal directed,
now not magically so, but in a cybernetic sense, like a thermostat, but still biology doesn't,
molecular biology and so on doesn't love discussing goals and things like that,
even though we now have a perfectly good engineering science of it. What this kind of view
does though is that it makes a very strong prediction, it predicts that if we wanted to
make changes up here, if this is all true and there is some kind of a set point being stored,
and it's not purely feedforward emergence, then what we should be able to do is find how that
set point is being stored, learn to read it, learn to rewrite it, and then the cells would
build something else without having to make any changes to the hardware down here. In other words,
if it's true that there is some degree of reprogrammability, this idea that the collective
compares to a pattern memory, builds to that pattern, we could change the pattern and not
have to actually rewire the machine, how general is this, what else can these cells do? So you
can see this now tying back into the themes that I started off with, with Turing and such.
Okay, so for the next part of the talk, I want to show you an example of how this works,
because we've been looking for this and we think we found it and we've started to learn to read
and write it. And the medium of all of this, maybe not terribly surprising for any neuroscientist,
is bioelectricity. So how does this work in the brain? Real quick, just that the hardware looks
like this, there's a collection of cells in the network, they have ion channels which enable
voltage states to exist and maybe propagate to their neighbors via these electrical synapses,
known as gap junctions, so that's the hardware. And then the commitment of neuroscience is that
all of the electrophysiology that goes on, and so this group made an amazing video of
zebrafish brain activity in a live fish thinking about whatever it is that fish think about,
the idea is that all of the memories, the goals, the cognitive content of that mind
is embedded in this electrical activity. And thus, there's the idea of neural decoding,
that if we understood the encoding, we should be able to read out the physiological activity
and then understand what the animal was thinking about or what its memories were and that kind
of thing. So it turns out that this same exact system works everywhere in your body, so this is
an extremely ancient set of tools that the evolution uses, every cell in your body has ion channels,
most cells in your body have the exact same electrical synapses, there are neural transmitter
signaling in most tissues of the body. And so we can now think about a similar project, what about
neuroscience outside of neurons? What if we could decode the electrical conversations that other
cells were having with each other and understand how this kind of electrical glue was functioning
outside of the brain? And so this is an early frog embryo using very similar technology, we
developed voltage sensitive dye imaging, so the colors are voltages, they're of course very slowly
changing compared to this, but you can, this is a time lapse over about 12 hours, you can see all
the electrical conversations that the cells have with each other and all the patterning that goes
on. Now we know what brains think about, they think about behavior in three-dimensional spaces
and maybe linguistic spaces, what does the rest of the body think about using that same
process? Well, whereas in the brain what you have here is you have an electrical network
issuing commands to muscles to move the body through three-dimensional space, there's a very
isomorphic kind of picture where actually long before that what the system was doing was issuing
commands to individual cells to move the configuration of your body through morpher
space. So what we think evolution did was this was first and then what it simply did was to pivot
this whole thing to motion spaces instead of anatomical spaces. So we started, we got our
inspiration from neuroscience, we steal a lot of tools and concepts from the neuroscientists
and so here are some of the tools we use. First of all, we can do the imaging to see what the
electrical activity is, we do a lot of quantitative simulation to understand how the voltages arise
from the various ion channel activity. Here's what some of these things look like, this is an
early frog embryo putting its face together and one of the things you can see and so the
the grayscale here is the bioelectric voltage potentials across the tissue and this is one frame
from that tissue, from that video what you can see is that long before the genes turn on to
actually pattern the face and long before the face really appears you can already read out
a pre-pattern, a bioelectrical pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like,
here's where the mouth is going to be, here's where the eye is going to be, here are the
placodes. I'm showing you this one because it's the most obvious one to understand,
there's other patterns that we need a lot of decoding but this one's kind of kind of simple,
you can see exactly what it's going to do and this pattern is functional. If I change the
electrical properties of this, if I sort of draw using either optogenetics or other tools to draw
on this, I can wipe out this eye, I can put it somewhere else, I can change the location of
the mouth, all of this is actually determinative, this is the set point that guides future cell
activity. So that's a natural bioelectrical pattern, this is a pathological one, we'll talk
about that momentarily but this is the one, there's an incipient tumor which we injected a human
oncogene and before that tumor appears you can already see the disruption where these cells
are basically, that oncogene causes them to electrically isolate from their neighbors
and basically at that point they're just amoebas treating the rest of the animal as
the external environment, they just disconnect from everything. So we use the same tools that
neuroscientists use to control these electrical states, we can target the ion channels here,
we can target the gap junction so we can control the topology of the electrical network, we can
control the specific states using optogenetics, using drugs, using ion channel mutations,
no electric fields, applications, no waves, no magnets, no electromagnetics, this is exactly
what neuroscientists do by controlling the, by using it, by exploiting the actual interface,
right, that the system gives us to manipulate the computations that it does. So how do we know
this is of any use, what happens when you do this? Well, here's one simple example, what we can do is
I showed you a bioelectrical pattern that tells the animal where to put its eye, so well we can
reproduce that pattern somewhere else by injecting ion channel genes, specific, let's say potassium
channel somewhere else, and so you can introduce that pattern onto the gut and that tells the gut
cells, hey you need to make an eye here, and if you section that eye you get all the right lens,
you know, lens right in the optic nerve, you get all that stuff. Now a couple of interesting things,
what one is that the modularity is amazing because what we actually introduce is a very
low information content signal, we don't give all the information that you need to know how to make
an eye, what are all the 30 different cell types that are inside the eye, we don't produce any of
that, it's very modular, it's a subroutine call, we say build an eye here, and everything else,
all the molecular cascades that actually required to build an eye and make, you know, retinal cells
and all that, all that's downstream, so that's the first thing, it's highly modular. The second
thing is that it has a really interesting competency, one of them is that in this case,
what you're looking at, this is a cross section of a lens, right here, sitting out in the tail
somewhere of a tadpole, and the blue cells are the ones that we actually injected with our
ion channel, so we told these blue cells, you need to make an eye, but there's not enough of them to
make an eye, so very much like ants in an ant colony, what they do is they know how to recruit
their neighbors, what they did is recruit a bunch of these brown cells, which themselves were never
touched by us, they're completely normal body cells, and they're able to say to these cells,
we need to make a lens here, there's not enough of us to make a lens, you're now going to participate,
and that same thing is studied by people who work on collective insects and so on,
this ability to gauge the sort of size of the project you're embarking on, and recruit
other members of the swarm to work with you, so these cells certainly have the ability to do that.
You can make, using that same modulation, we've discovered the code for things like inner ear
organs, so otocysts, hearts, so inducing ectopic hearts, extra forebrain, extra limbs, here are
some six-legged frogs here that you can see, and fins, now this is interesting, tadpoles aren't
supposed to have fins, that's more of a fish thing, we'll get to that momentarily, and so one thing
that we can do with this now that we're starting to sort of uncover some of the native subroutines
that are there, is we can use this in a regenerative medicine setting, so here's a frog, normally if a
frog loses a leg here by 45 days later, there's nothing, frogs don't regenerate their legs at
this stage on like salamanders, but what we can do now is we can give it the signal that says, hey,
you need to rebuild this leg, and what happens here is that the way we do that is with a drug that
opens specific ion channels at the wound, it turns on the genes that you need to get started on
regeneration, by 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail, eventually a very
nice leg, which is touch sensitive and motile, so it's a very simple approach to, again we're not
reprogramming stem cells, we're not 3D printing any tissues, this is that point about the programming
I made earlier on, we do not want to interact with the system at the lowest level by telling
molecular pathways or cells what to do, we want to discover the large-scale subroutines and the
large-scale control structure that allows us to say, build a leg, so we are in at this point
trials in rodents, I have to do a disclosure here, because this is Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders
of Morphosuticals, which seeks to apply this kind of approach to regenerative medicine,
hopefully someday for humans, so you can see that, that's kind of the applied
side of the work. I want to switch to an amazing animal, which really is going to help us understand
some more aspects of this, which are that, these are the plenair, you can cut them into as many
pieces as you want, I think the record is like 275 or something like that, they're immortal,
they have no lifespan limit, they do not age, they're extremely resistant to cancer and they have
the world's worst genome, we can talk about what that means later on if we have time,
but they have incredible capacity for morphogenetic control, one of the interesting things is that
remember that I promised you at the beginning that we would be able to
look for the pattern memory, we would look for that encoding of the set point, that anatomical
set point that tells the cells what do we build and when are we complete, so I want to show you
a story where we can rewrite that pattern memory and I've kind of shown you examples already,
the thing with the face and the eye is kind of an example, but I think this is even better,
so here's our plenair, it has one head and one tail, the anterior genes are up here,
turned on at the head, turned off at the tail, fine, and if I amputate head and tail,
this middle fragment reliably 100% of the time gives us a nice worm, now one of the things
that we did was to discover a bioelectric circuit that actually told the cells, this fragment,
well how many heads are you supposed to have, right, once the head and the tail are chopped off,
which end is the head or maybe both should be the head, how would you know,
so we discovered this electrical circuit and what we were able to do
is to convert this perfectly normal one-headed animal to a state that once we cut it,
it makes a two-headed worm, this is not Photoshop, these are real, these are real,
real live animals, and here's how it works, it's because if you look at this fragment,
it has this bioelectrical pattern that says one head, one tail, and that's what the cells build,
but what we can do is we can take, using various ways to modulate ion channels,
we can convert this pattern to this pattern, now it's a little messy, right, but you can see here
the technology is still very much being worked out, but you can see what's happening here,
there are two, now the codes is two heads, and sure enough, if I now cut this animal, there he is,
now here's a very important point that we need to understand, this electrical map is not a map
of this two-headed creature, this electrical map is a map of this one-headed animal in which we
have manipulated the electric circuit such that the voltage looks like this, it sits there being
one-headed until it's injured, and at that point the cells consult this map and build this two-headed
worm, so the bioelectrical pattern is not a readout of the current anatomy, this is a, you can
think about this as a primitive counterfactual memory, this is a memory of something that is
not happening right now, in fact may never happen, but if it does, if we get injured,
this is what a correct worm is supposed to look like, and we will keep rebuilding until
this is the pattern we get, so this is an encoded set point, a single-headed planarian body can
encode at least one of two different ideas of what a planarian is supposed to look like,
maybe more, no doubt more, we just said we found two, you know, we found two, so this is very
important, this is the basics of counterfactual memory, this electric circuit can hold at least
one of two different representations of what correct planarian should look like, and upon injury
the cells don't, this is their reference point, they have nothing else to gauge by, now why do I
keep calling it a memory, because like every good memory, it is not only rewritable, but it's long
term stable, so if I take these two-headed worms, and now I amputate the head, and I amputate
this other ectopic head, and I leave just the nice normal mid fragment, no more treatments of any
kind, plain water, the genetics haven't been changed, we never edited the genome, there's
nothing wrong with the genetics of this animal, so you might think that okay, well once you've
cut this off, now you'll go back to normal, and that's not what happens, so these animals
forever in perpetuity now generate two-headed worms, so where is the fact, where is it stored
that they're now two-headed worms, it is stored in the electrical pattern distributed over the
cells, that pattern has a memory property, once you've changed it, it holds, and in fact now
we know how to change it back, so we can take that pattern, change it back to a one-headed,
and then you get a line of one-headed animals, so the answer to how, what determines how many
heads Plenaria have is not really nailed down by the genetics, what the genetics does is it gives
you an electric circuit that by default says one head, but that circuit is reprogrammable,
you can change it to say two heads, and it will hold state, as far as we can tell forever, and
then you can sort of flip it back and forth, so you can think this kind of like a distributed
sort of flip-flop, and here are these two-headed Plenaria in their kind of native habitat,
so what we're doing now, so there's a lot of computational work that needs to happen,
one thing is that we're trying to map out the bioelectric state space of that circuit to understand
why certain parts of it correspond to one head, two head, and so on, and view that kind of
regeneration is a kind of energy minimization process where basically what you're doing,
and this will be familiar to all of you, study this kind of stuff, to recover these pattern
memories when they are damaged, and so we really want to see if some of the tools of connectionist
kinds of computer science can help us understand what's going on here, the link between the physics
of the circuit and the information processing of memory, of recall, of energy minimization,
now I want to show you how far we can go with this, so here I've shown you one head, two head,
I mean that's pretty cool, but these are normal heads that belong to these animals anyway,
well one thing you can do is you can push them into further attractors in that state space that
belong to other species, so I can take this triangular shaped worm with no genetic change
whatsoever, with completely normal hardware I can cause, just by disrupting that electrical
decision-making when you cut off the head, they have to decide what the head shape is,
I can make flat heads like the Pifolina, we can make round heads like an S Mediterranean,
or of course we can make the normal ones, the shape of the brain becomes just like these other
species, the distribution of stem cells in the brain becomes just like these other species,
they can access, a genetically normal set of cells can access other morphological attractors
if you push them that way along this bioelectrical interface,
you can even push them further and you can make, you can reach shapes that don't belong
to plenary at all, so you can make these kind of hybrid forms, you can make
radially symmetrical you know sort of ski cap looking things, you can make these weird spiky
forms, there's a tremendous variety of anatomical forms that you can achieve if you interfere with
the ability of these cells to navigate morphospace, what they want to do is to reach this region of
the morphospace and they're very good at it, but now that we found this electrical process
by which they navigate, we can push them into other areas, so what we're doing now is we're
building some, so we have a very a biorealistic computational simulator of electrical activities,
so we can we can sort of look at the circuits at the tissue level, how do they rescale and
all of that, and then we're trying the goal, long-term goal is this kind of full stack model
where we start with the facts of which ion channels are expressed, so that's where the genetics
plays out and that's your hardware, but then at the tissue level, what are all the voltage
dynamics, they're really not obvious because all of these channels, a lot of them are voltage gated,
that's a voltage gated current conductance, that's a transistor, so when you put these
things into circuits, you have all kinds of symmetry breaking loops, they have all,
they can do memory as I just showed you, they have all kinds of interesting computations,
but very nonlinear, hard to predict, and so then we want to understand this decision making of head
versus tail versus, you know, what else, and to the point where we get to an algorithmic model,
so we're using some machine learning approaches to try and extract actually kind of white box
algorithmic models so that then at this point we can say, okay, but what would we need to do
if we wanted a fatter worm or three heads or, you know, if somebody needed a new finger or a
new eye or something like that. Okay, so for the last bit, I'm just gonna finish up with a couple
of things. I want to talk about very quickly this idea of, because what I've shown you is
the collective intelligence of individual cells solving a very large-scale problem,
they solve a problem that the individual cells don't have, so I want to talk about this idea of
scaling. This is what evolution does. Evolution takes this kind of creature and enables them to
connect with each other to solve problems at the level of anatomical morphospace, so for example,
if we don't have enough fingers, we will know that the tissue knows that and can regenerate
the right number of fingers, then it stops. Individual cells have no idea what a finger is
or how many fingers there are or anything like that, but the collective does, and so what evolution
does is this amazing scaling up, but that process has a failure mode. That failure mode is known as
cancer, so what happens in cancer is that when individual cells disconnect from this electrical
network, they go back to being single cell amoebas where their goals are now maximal proliferation
and maximal metabolic gain instead of having goals in anatomical morphospace, so this is human
glioblastoma. These are cells crawling around in culture with no inclination to work hard towards
these kinds of things, so what happens is that the magic here is in these electrical connections,
these gap junctions that allow cells to share information very tightly and in particular,
they're called synapses because they are open and closed by prior experiences, meaning that
the information that moves through a particular synapse also feeds back because of their voltage
sensitivity to open and close that synapse, so you have this kind of activity-dependent memory,
and so that allows a tissue to have much larger cognitive light cones in terms of how much do
they remember, how much can they anticipate, how much can they measure than individual cells.
That's the scale-up, and so another biomedical application that we're working on is to force
that connection, so here is this, we inject an oncogene, so normally it would make a tumor,
here it is that the oncogene is blazingly expressed, in fact it's all over the place here,
but there is no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected a very specific ion channel
that forces that cell to remain in electrical connection with their neighbors, so when you
force them, even if the genetics are screwed up, so I've shown you a number of examples where
the genetics is diverting from the actual outcome, what the hardware says is one thing,
but you can make changes and we have lots of other examples of fixing birth defects and other
things in software by temporary electrical states that push the system in a way that
it normally wouldn't have done, and so this is a tumor normalization technology that we're also
trying to move to a medical outcome, so what we're trying, the big mystery here, what we're
trying to do now is to make computational models of local homeostatic loops that started out in
bacteria by managing pH and metabolics and things like that, and show how by connecting these,
so basically what you have is a network of homeostats, so you have a network of these things
that are able to control local variables towards set points, and by connecting them
you are enabling the collective to now do the same thing, but in a much different space,
so this is the big area where we need to understand lots more, and so these are the
kind of models that we're thinking about, so for the last couple of minutes I want to talk about
this idea of novel organisms, so we wanted, oh and I have to do another disclosure, we also have
a spin-off company for biorebotics called Fauna Systems, and this is all the work with Josh
Baumgart at University of Vermont with whom we've started visiting the Institute for Computationally
Designed Organisms, we wanted to ask a simple question, how far does this plasticity go? I've
shown you that normal embryos are able to adapt to changes of cell number, cell shape, amount of DNA,
but also you can push them to make, you can make worms with the heads that belong to other species
and body, worm bodies that are just not normal plenaria worms, so how far does that plasticity
go, and in particular if you take cells away from their normal context, can they reboot their
multicellularity, what will they do, and so we did this experiment, I'm going to pause this right
here, so this is a frog embryo in cross-section, if you take off this top part here, these all of
these cells up here are going to be skin, they're all faded to be different kinds of epidermis,
and so we asked this question, if I take these cells, I disassociate them, I put a little drop of
them in a separate environment away from all of this stuff, so I'm not, we're not adding any kind
of, and by the way the person who physically does this is Doug Blackiston in our group, he's a staff
scientist who perfected a lot of these protocols, we're not adding synthetic biology constructs,
we're not changing the DNA, we're not putting any weird nano materials, we're
engineered by subtraction, we're taking away the instructive signals from all of this stuff,
and so what would they do, well they might die, they might spread out and sort of crawl away from
each other, they might form a two-dimensional model layer like cell culture, we don't know,
but those are some things they might do, instead what they do is, so here these are loose cells,
this is time lapse, so overnight they sort of come together and they merge into this little thing,
this little round thing, the flashes or calcium flashes, we'll talk about that momentarily,
what does it do, so this is a little ball of skin, what does a little ball of skin do,
well the first thing it does is, it takes little hairs that are normally used on the skin to move
the mucus down the body of the animal, and it uses those hairs to swim, it rose through the media,
by pushing the little hairs in opposite directions to the left and right of a midline that it can
organize, here you can see some behaviors, so they can go in circles, they can sort of patrol
back and forth, they can hear some tracking data on group behavior, so this guy's going on kind of
a long journey, you know these are interacting with each other, then sometimes they sit still
for long periods of time, they have autonomous motion, this is what they look like in a maze,
so this is a water maze, there's no flow, there are no gradients, it's just still spring water,
it goes down here, it takes the corner without having to bump into the outside wall,
so it doesn't have to bump into anything, it just follows the corner, and then around this,
at this point, let's play it again, so remember this is just skin, there are no brain, there's no
brain, there's no nervous system, so it takes this corner, and then at this point, for some reason
that we don't know, internal behaviors, it turns around and goes back where it came from, doesn't
want to keep going anymore, so they have a range of behaviors, if you ask what does the calcium
signaling look like, again, no neurons here, but the skin is actually very active, with very
brain-like dynamics, which we are now analyzing using information theory and things like that,
to see what's going on and whether they might be talking to each other, they have regenerative
capacity, so if I cut it in half, they will try to fold up to their new xenobot shape,
with the amazing force to the 180-degree hinge that they have to deploy to fold themselves up,
and the most amazing thing that they do is this, Josh and his student, Sam Creedman,
did computational simulations of these guys in a virtual world, with different shapes that Doug
was able to actually make, and we saw something very interesting, that in the computational
simulation, one of the things they do is they rearrange the particles in their environment
into specific shapes, that was a prediction of the simulation, so we tried, we gave them some
particles, what did we give them, we gave them cells, loose cells, this is the white stuff,
the snow here, that those are loose cells, and what you see is that the xenobots run around,
they corral these particles into little piles, and then they sort of
continue to polish those little piles until they become these circular things, and then
because what we did was we gave them skin cells, these little piles became the next generation
of xenobots, and so guess what, when they matured, they went and did the same thing, and they created
the next generation of xenobots, so this is Von Neumann's dream, this is a machine that
runs around and makes copies of itself from particles or the parts that it finds in its
environment, the only reason this trick works, of course, is because like evolution, and like us,
it's working within a gentile material, it's working with cells that are not passive,
you know, pebbles, but are actually materials that when you collect them into a little pile,
they already have the competency of becoming a xenobot, so it actually takes very little to
get this, you know, to get this reproductive cycle happening, so the last couple of things I just
want to say is this, we can learn, we can learn some interesting things from this, this is the
standard Xenopus lavas genome, the standard frog, if you only observe standard development,
you are really lulled into a false sense of security, you're given the idea that well,
acorns always make oak trees, frog eggs always make frogs, the genome determines morphology,
this is what they can make, they make an embryo that has a certain set of developmental sequences,
and then a certain behavior, that's what this hardware makes, actually, if you liberate these
skin cells, so what do skin cells know how to do? Well, of course, they know how to be a boring
two-dimensional outer layer on this animal, keep out the bacteria, that's it, well, that's what they
do when the other cells sort of bully them into that role, the other, the instructive interactions
from the other cells are what's constraining the capacity of these skin cells to sit quietly as the
outer layer, and that's that, on their own, given the ability to escape these instructive interactions,
they're actually capable of much more, they make a xenobot, they undergo a developmental sequence
over the next two months, they become this thing, I don't know what the heck this is, they have their
own, you know, kind of, kind of a weird developmental trajectory, and their behaviors are things like
making copies of themselves via kinematic self-replication. Now, this is interesting because
for every other creature on earth, if you were to ask why does it have a certain shape, a certain
behavior, how does it be able to do whatever it is that it does, the answer is always the same,
well, years of selection, right, eons of evolutionary pressure to do this or that,
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good
xenobot, to do kinematic self-replication to any of the behaviors that they do, and the morphology,
there's never been any pressure for that, so where does this come from, right, this plasticity,
this amazing fact that evolution gave us this genome that very reliably does this,
but it also can do this, and who knows what else, right, I think we're just scratching the surface,
so I'm going to end here and just say that the main points I think that are emerging from all
our work, including many things I didn't show you is this, evolution tends to build generic problem
solving machines, which because of this kind of compression of complex bodies into a single cell
during sexual reproduction, really enables some amazing hardware that exploits aspects
of physics and computation that doesn't try to precode everything, and development shows us that
these kind of agents in morphospace and in other spaces really have to deal with whatever they're
given at the beginning, they are not, in the large part, they are not tied to a very specific,
very tight set of initial conditions, and we can also talk about, there's this intelligence
ratchet that's formed because that competency actually hides a lot of genomic fitness information
from evolution, so a lot of the effort goes into that competency actually as opposed to the hardware,
and the physiology, especially the bioelectrics, can navigate various problem spaces with all
kinds of competencies, all kinds of interesting competencies, and then synthetic bioengineering
tells us that life, because of all of this, life is extremely interoperable, we can make
any kind of combination of hardware, software, this is one of my favorite kind of videos,
this is an early baby model, discovering for the first time what kinds of effectors it has,
look at this, I've got legs, I've got arms, amazing, so one of the, they don't know, you see,
you don't know ahead of time when embryos are born into this world, much like Josh
Bongard's robots, they don't know right away what they have, where their boundaries with
the outside world is, all of that has to be computationally defined spontaneously, so if we're
thinking about how intelligence is coming to this world, here's what the biology is telling us,
multi-scale competencies, lots of levels as Daniel was talking about at the very beginning,
competing and cooperating with each other, spontaneous emergence of boundaries, energy
constraints which require you to do course-graining on your inputs, self-modeling, all of this kind
of stuff is what biology is telling us, and because of this interoperability, everything
that we know in the natural world, all of the Darwin's endless forms most beautiful are just
the tiny corner of this option space, every combination of evolved material, designed machinery,
and software is some kind of agent, and a lot of this already exists, so hybrid, cyborgs,
all kinds of things, the future is going to look like this, and that really means that
we have to redefine a lot of our old categories that started out by looking at this picture of
the Garden of Eden, where you have a standard human, you have some standard animals, and that's
it, and you can draw a simple line and you know what's going on, that picture is gone,
so I'm just going to close here, there are some papers that if anybody's interested in
diving further into these issues, here's some papers I could send you, I want to thank all
the people that did the work, so Doug and Sam did all the xenobot work, here are the other
students and postdocs that contributed to this stuff, our collaborators, our funders, most of
all our model systems, the animals do most of the heavy lifting here, and that's it, I thank
you for listening, and I will take any questions. Oh thank you for a really marvelous talk,
so yes, and yeah, so we have a few minutes for questions, I think you said we have about
10 minutes left, so yep, okay, yes, Daniel, I think you were first?
If I start asking, nobody else will have time, so I leave my papers and leave my mind for the
last. Okay, Christoph, I thought I saw your hand. Oh sorry, I was just clapping. Oh, okay, okay,
well, anyone else before I start asking questions as well, so okay, in that case
I have, you know, too many questions and I don't know enough about it, and I'd really like to
know more about these bioelectrical patterns and how you, I don't know, for instance,
seem to have gained control over how to manipulate those, say for, you know, you fix the genetics and
you give it the somehow the phenotype of a different creature, a different animal entirely,
that is absolutely mind-blowing, I have to say, and how, I mean, it almost seems like,
you know, you could make the phenotype of, it almost seems like the genetics isn't as important
as we thought it would be, I mean, it's just, yeah, to what extent can you get something
with a sort of drastically, how drastically different can the phenotype end up?
I think that, well, look, in the plan area, it's a 150 million years difference between
the animals that we start with and the ones that we can make, and it's equivalent to 150 million
years of evolutionary distance to these other species, plus, of course, we can make shapes
that never existed, so, you know, I don't know what the distance there would be, but I think it's
a very important point. I think absolutely the role of the genome is not what we thought it was,
you know, one of the key things here, though, is that I think, and a lot of people get very
suspicious about, you know, sort of computer science analogies, but I think the part that is
actually very, very useful is the distinction between hardware and software, so I think that
tells us what, you know, the genome, this, there's, you know, sometimes students are taught this,
this, that, well, you know, the cell is the hardware that interprets the genome, and the genome is
the software of this, I think that's completely wrong. I think what the genome actually does is
nail down the hardware of the cell. The genome tells you what channels you're going to have.
If your genome does not give you a voltage-gated ion channel, there's very limited,
you don't have those transistors, there's very limited things you can do, so the hardware is
critical because it facilitates or forbids certain kinds of behavior modes, but we all know now that
knowing the hardware does not tell you all of the interesting things you need to know about what
this thing is going to be able to do. Not only does it, that can the same hardware run many
different kinds of behavior modes, but also it means that the way you interact with it does not
have to be at the hardware level, right, that that's kind of the huge insight to me of computer
science, this idea of reprogrammability, there are certain, that once you get beyond a certain
capacity, and I think biological systems are way beyond that, you can interact with it via inputs,
via stimuli, via communication, via who knows how high that goes, not just by rewiring it,
and so I think that all of this, the focus on the DNA, both as the source of the information
and as the optimal control knob, all the excitement over genomic editing and everything else,
those things I think are misplaced, but that's not to say that the genome isn't important,
I mean you need to have the right hardware, if you don't have the right hardware, you're not
going to be able to do certain things. So it's like there's a whole area of interaction with
physics, what this hardware can do, that you know, there is some physics that it exploits,
and that doesn't need to be in the genome, and yeah, it's, yeah. Yeah, that's a very profound,
that's a very profound idea, which is that, and people have been thinking about this actually
in mathematics for the longest time, so where do the truths of number theory live, where you
could change all the facts of the initial conditions of the universe, and the number theory
would still be what it is, and so think about this, if you were to try to evolve a triangle,
so you evolve the first angle, you evolve the second angle, but guess what, you don't need
to evolve the third angle, you know what it is, where does that come from, that's an amazing
kind of free lunch, you know, as the physicists would say, right, and the same thing with
computation, so once you evolve that ion channel, that's basically a transistor, so now you get
to have logic gates and truth tables, did you have to evolve a truth table, no, you got that for
free, where do truth tables live, you know, I don't know, but that's kind of beyond my pay grade,
but I think you're absolutely right, is that what evolution does is it builds machines that couple
to these amazing affordances, right, so in the behavioral ecology they would call these affordances,
these incredible affordances provided by physics, by computation, by geometry, by mechanics,
you know, who knows what else is out there, yeah, I think that's really an important way to look at
evolution. Oh, that's, yeah, Daniel, yes. I can't hold myself any longer, but first of all,
this is an amazing talk, I wish we could now sit together and talk for the rest of the afternoon,
which neither you nor I can do, but we should definitely continue talking.
One thing that I find we, first of all, I completely agree with this point about the triangle,
so I just recently said to somebody that mathematics is neither discovered nor
constructed, but it's something in between, right, and basically you construct some things and then
there are constraints that emerge and they are implicit to whatever you do, and it's a bit like
what I call a box of oranges, you fill the box of oranges and you get these hexagonal patterns
once you're dense enough, and this is not something you created, it's an aspect of the space that
forces this upon us, but we still have choices between different crystal patterns, for example,
in the dimensions, for example, there are 14 crystal patterns. What I was wondering, I mean,
to me, it looks like there's an element of holography in the whole thing, so where information is
not fully localized, and I felt that's the most strong reaction in your example with the brain,
with double, with a reconstructed brain, because the question is how much information can you
retain holographically, so when you take this plant on warm, and I think that was in the experiment
that where mice, I think mice got, the question is, well, how much information can you retain
when my language, I would say how many bits can you retain in this delocalized form?
That's a great point, I have no idea how much information, we can't do the bits thing because
we don't know what the encoding and decoding of the message is, so that's hard, but you're
absolutely right, there's holography here in two ways, one is the sort of lateral way, which is
that most of this information is distributed spatially across the whole animal, so the bioelectric
code and what enables us to do these various things is not a single cell code, this is not
something that tells individual cells what cell type they should be, this is spread across the
whole tissue, and of course you can cut it both spatially and behaviorally, it rescales the
information onto every piece retains it, so that's kind of lateral holography, there's also a vertical
one which is interesting, in a very important sense, a lot of the same rules that operate in
controlling the morphology of large-scale bodies, like ours, some of those same
rules are playing out in the shaping of single cells, so there are weird
mathematical aspects of morphology that work the same way in multicellular bodies,
but also in single cells that are completely low at a much lower scale, and other people
have found the same thing in patterning of ant colonies and so on, so there's also this kind of
kind of almost a fractal kind of idea, that the same things repeat themselves again and again
at different scales, despite the fact that the material implementation is quite different
at that point. That sounds really very interesting because I do think that there might be ways of
actually quantifying that, and I very much like this attractor vision of genetic coding,
because we know that embodiment can change a lot, I mean the talk that I give with you,
I think I mentioned that very, very primitive example of how you can totally change the amount
of information you need to do something if you change embodiment, so really drastically different
big question is how much can you associate to the embodiment, how much can you associate to,
in your case, the genome? I see the Stavros question, so I just go silent, we can discuss
another time, so let Stavros go ahead, sorry. Stavros? Yeah, I'll take the question,
but I apologize in about three minutes, I do have to run.
Yeah, sorry, sorry to interrupt you Daniel, thanks for your talk, I'll be very quick.
I've seen you in other talks sort of talk about using the language of affect,
to kind of describe navigating these morphological spaces and kind of extending
the concept of affect beyond where it's usually used to describe these morphological spaces,
talk more on that. Yeah, I think, I mean that's a very long discussion, but the short
version of it is that we have been trying to map as many concepts in cognitive neuroscience
as we can onto this, for example, navigating morphospace, so all kinds of issues that people
normally attribute to, so goal-seeking behavior, rewards, punishments, different types of learning
and memory, different types of affect, all these kinds of things, perceptual bystability,
visual illusions, all of these things can be mapped very, very nicely, and in fact, I have
tables in a couple of papers, which I'm happy to send, where it just goes side by side and
it shows you exactly what the mapping is, and so there are mappings for affect and for many of
these terms, and I'm not saying all of them are going to map, but so far the symmetry has worked
kind of very nicely, so you can define these things in other spaces.
It's incredible, thank you. Thank you so much. Drop me an email and I'll send you the paper
where we go into this. Okay, so are there any more questions? I don't know if there's actually
time for any more questions, but I wish there were, but yeah, so take this opportunity once
more to thank the speaker for a wonderful talk. Thank you so much, really appreciate the discussion,
and please by all means email me, I'd love to discuss with anybody anytime. Thank you again.
Okay, thank you so much everybody. Thank you. All right, bye.
