So this is going to be conceptually pretty similar
to what we talked about last time,
but it's a little more condensed and focused
onto just the core price economics,
or the absolute basics of understanding the economics
of collective intelligence.
And so I'm just gonna basically go through it.
It's fairly dry and abstract,
but the idea is if you can understand everything
in this talk, then you've got the bare minimum.
And anytime you wanna jump in, just feel free.
And we'll just go through it.
It's about 20 or so slides.
It should take about half an hour,
and then we can discuss for the rest of the time.
Great, yeah, go for it.
Fantastic, cool.
So this is a talk of prices as cognitive glue
and introduction to the economics
of collective intelligence.
So here are our goals.
Our primary goal is to learn the bare minimum economics
for understanding the general abstract principles
of collective intelligence.
So there's a couple of things going on there.
First, regarding bare minimum.
So obviously I don't know a lot about biology,
but I do know some absolute basics.
I have a basic concept of what a cell is,
a basic concept of what DNA is,
and this is helpful for understanding your work.
Similarly, what this presentation should do
is give you the absolute bare minimum
for understanding the basic economics
of collective intelligence.
If you can basically grasp everything in this presentation,
then you should be good to go.
And regarding the abstract side of things.
So biology is very useful
for understanding collective intelligence
because it lets you see concretely
that you start as a single cell, you're just physics,
and there's no magical transition
where you become like a real intelligence
or something like that.
Economics allows us to do the complete opposite
where it naturally gives us a bird's eye view
and we can see the whole forest
without having to navigate through all the trees.
And so that's going to bring in the other side of this
and having the concrete and the abstract
is going to be very powerful.
So specifically we're going to understand three ideas.
The first is that economic production,
even building something as simple as a pencil
is actually incredibly complicated.
You have to coordinate across millions of people,
dozens of countries and tens of years.
You obviously need some way of managing that.
The way that gets managed is through the price system.
The price system is the cognitive glue
that makes this possible
by connecting people across space and time.
And mostly what we're going to be focused on
is how the price system works
with an emphasis on the idea that prices
erase the distinction between other people,
stresses and rewards in your own,
turning one person's problem into everyone's problem.
And so the hypothesis background in this talk
which I cannot prove but I think is quite plausible
is that all collective intelligences work
according to the same basic economic principles.
So on the surface they might seem very different
like a cell versus a person versus an economy
but I think underneath the hood
it's all just the same economics.
So let's get into it.
So let's talk about making a pencil.
This is a very familiar object
which we're hopefully all familiar with.
This down here is a little diagram of what happens
once you've got a nice block of wood.
And it seems very easy.
You cut down a tree, you sort of divide up
the wood into these slats, you slide some graphite in,
you glue the slats back together,
then you dice it up
and you attach some brass and rubber at the end
and you get some nice lettering for Dix and Ticonderoga
who are not sponsoring this
but just a little free advertising.
So it seems very easy to do.
But in reality making a pencil
actually requires an immense degree of coordination
that seems virtually impossible
once you start breaking it down.
So to chop down a tree you need a saw.
So to make a saw you need some ore
and these are gonna be in different places.
So maybe your trees in like Oregon
but your ore is in like West Virginia.
So all of a sudden you're on like opposite sides
of the country.
And so then you need refining processes
to take that ore and make it into steel
and manufacturing processes to take that steel
and turn it into saws and helmets and so forth.
And just as you keep iterating it grows like this
all of these processes are very complex.
They take a lot of people,
a lot of training, a lot of knowledge
and somehow all of it has to come together
in a very complicated way.
And this isn't just true for chopping down trees
but it's true for the graphite, the brass, et cetera.
All of the elements of a pencil are very complicated
to actually acquire.
And each and every one of them requires
an immense degree of coordination.
And not only are they individually very complex
but they all have to come together at the same point
in space and time so that you can actually
combine it into a pencil.
So they all need to be coordinated with each other.
And in the modern age these processes
don't even exist in the same country.
So you might have manufacturing in China,
wood from Brazil, your rubber from Mexico, et cetera.
These processes take years to complete
and they're not on any kind of shared timetable.
So managing this process seems incredibly complex
and you have to manage it without a pencil
because you haven't built a pencil yet
so you can't even write things down.
So the question is how are you able to do this?
And what's most incredible about this process
is that the degree of coordination necessary
is achieved with so much robustness and reliability
but I can take this incredible pencil
which we now know takes millions of people
in decades to produce.
I can stab in the half and nobody cares
because these pencils are so widely available.
The system works so well that its outputs
are entirely unremarkable and you can easily predict
that you're going to have access to them.
So there has to be some kind of system managing everything.
We obviously can't leave this up to random chance.
And whatever that managing system is,
it seems reasonable to call it intelligence
because it does what we expect intelligence to do
which is to navigate around obstacles to reach a goal space.
So like when COVID-19 broke out,
you didn't rush to the store to buy a bunch of pencils
because you knew there would be pencils
if you ever needed one.
One hypothesis is that there might just be a set of instructions
in the economy somewhere telling everyone what to do
but in economics, there is nothing analogous to DNA
where we might think a set of instructions are hiding.
There just are no instructions full stop.
So then we've got to really figure out how is this possible?
And the answer to that is the price system.
So this is going to be our primary focus for this talk
is just the basics of how the price system works.
So this is the famous supply and demand graph.
This is going to be the supply and demand for pencils.
All the numbers are made up just to illustrate.
And so the basic way this graph works is on our y-axis,
we have the price of pencils and on the x-axis,
we have the quantity of pencils
and the graph is done backwards for historical reasons.
So the y-axis is going to be our independent variable.
The x-axis is our dependent variable.
So quantity is a function of price.
And we've got our two curves here,
our demand curve in red and our supply curve in green.
And how each of these curves work is first of all,
the demand curve is the sum of everyone's plans
to buy pencils at every price point.
So how this curve is constructed,
if you could just like peer inside everyone's mind,
what you would do is you would say, okay, at a price of $5,
how many pencils does everyone plan to buy?
And the total amount of that
is the market demand for pencils at $5,
then you just iterate down.
So the demand curve slopes down
because as the price goes down,
people of course want to buy more.
So the price goes down and the quantity goes up
as we shift out to the right.
And then the supply curve is the same in the other direction.
It is the sum of everyone's plans
to sell pencils at every price.
So you do the same thing,
you just take the total amount of pencils
that everyone plans to sell at each price.
And the supply curve is going to slope up
because as the price goes up,
people naturally want to sell more pencils
and make more money.
And there's one special point here,
the equilibrium point for supply and demand intersect.
This is the point where everyone's plans match up.
No one is trying to sell a pencil that can't be sold
or buy a pencil that can't be bought.
So you can see that the quantity of supply
and the quantity of demand are the same
at this equilibrium point.
And this right here, it's a very simple graph,
but I think it actually does illustrate
the basic concept of how you could have a system
that could build a pencil
and how you could have a system
that's a collective intelligence
because if you can arrange a system
so that everyone's plans are mutually consistent
or even in the limit, if everyone has the same plan,
that's the key to large scale coordination.
Everyone is going to be naturally working together
rather than conflicting or at odds with each other.
One final thing to notice is that the reasons
behind the plans don't matter, your goals stay private.
So why you might want to buy a pencil
or why you might want to sell a pencil,
none of that matters.
So maybe you want to write something down,
maybe you're making pencil art, it doesn't matter.
Like the system works for any kind of plans,
any kind of goals, it doesn't need that information.
Given your plans, which only you need to know,
it's able to coordinate everyone regardless.
So this is the basic concept of how prices enable
this sort of large scale coordination.
But the question is, why would an individual
be interested in participating in this system?
It's good for the collective,
is it good for the individual?
And the answer is yes, because prices help you plan.
So to plan effectively, you need to know how available
one resource is relative to another.
Like if you want to eat fruit
and you're thinking if I want an apple or an orange,
you need to know how available are apples
relative to oranges.
If they're very available, they're probably easier to get
and so you'll have to give up less time
and less energy to acquire one.
Maybe you like the other one more,
but you need to know how the trade-off works.
So what economists say is that when a resource
is less available, it is more scarce.
And the scarcity of one resource relative to another
is called relative scarcity.
And the brilliant thing about prices
is that prices track relative scarcity.
So when people plan to buy more of something,
which is demand or plan to sell less of that,
which is supply, the resource becomes less available
and therefore more scarce.
And so by planning on price,
you can plan based on scarcity.
So it would be hard for you as an individual
to figure out how available are apples relative to oranges,
but it's very easy for you to figure out how costly,
how what's the price of apples relative to oranges,
because you can just go to the store and see that.
And just to see that in this graph here.
So this is our original equilibrium point
that we saw previously,
where they supply and demand curve intersect.
So if demand goes up, it now intersects here.
So the price is higher.
Or if supply goes down, it intersects here.
So again, the price is higher.
So when things become more scarce,
is people trying to use it more
or make it less available, the price goes up.
And similarly, if the demand were to go down
or the supply would go up,
that would make it more available and therefore cheaper.
So prices naturally track relative scarcity,
which is what you need to know.
And the elegance of this system
is that you can plan based on your budget.
So you have an amount of money,
let's just say like $100 or something.
You can naturally combine that budget
with the existing set of prices
that you can easily observe at the store
to tell you every possible bundle of resources
you can purchase, right?
It's all just at that point,
very elementary linear algebra.
You can just see all the combinations you can buy.
So at that point, it's just up to you and your competencies
to pick the best of all available combinations of resources
that you want to purchase,
which is in fact, what intelligence is all about.
You have a lot of alternative ways
of achieving a goal state,
and you're trying to pick the best one
and the price system makes that very easy.
You just say, how much money do I have?
How much does everything cost?
And that really simplifies the problem.
And so if equilibrium prices
actually do reflect relative scarcities,
then that allows you as an individual
to confidently choose your favorite available bundle
of resources, secure in the knowledge that your plan
will not conflict with other people's plans,
as long as the prices are in fact accurate,
and we'll talk about what happens when they're not.
So what happens if plants are wrong?
So we know that the price should be at this equilibrium point
where they intersect so that what everyone wants to do
is consistent with what everyone else wants to do.
What happens if the price is too high?
Let's say it's at $4 here.
What we can see by going over to the right here
is that the demand for pencils people want to buy
or plan to buy about 20 of them,
and people plan to sell about 30 of them.
So what this means is that sellers are gonna have this issue
where they're planning to sell all these pencils
and they're gonna use that money to do other things,
and no one's gonna buy these pencils
because they're too expensive.
So you're gonna have an issue
where people can't accomplish their plans.
And similarly, if the price is too low, it's at $2,
sellers want to sell maybe only 16 or so,
but buyers wanna buy about 35.
So you're gonna have an issue.
This creates what economists call a shortage.
Everyone wants to buy a pencil
and there just literally aren't enough
for everyone to accomplish their plan.
So the systems and conflict people's plans
aren't consistent with each other,
and that makes it difficult to achieve allostasis.
So this really matters in real life.
It's not just abstract graphs.
So this is an image of the famous 1970s gas lines.
I don't know if this is something you necessarily,
yeah, but so this is hopefully a familiar image
to some people, and you can see what this issue was.
So in the 1970s, the price of gasoline was kept too low.
There were some price controls on it,
and so people were seeing low prices
and planning to buy a lot of gas,
but people weren't planning to sell a lot of gas.
And so you had these issues where people were waiting in line
for hours to buy gas,
and then often they couldn't even buy gas
because the place had run out.
So when you get the price wrong,
you really do have this issue
where people's plans are in conflict with each other,
not everyone can accomplish their goals simultaneously,
and the system really gets jammed up in a very physical way
because people are trying to do things
that don't make sense
based on what other people are trying to do.
So we know why it's useful for prices to reach equilibrium,
but why would they reach equilibrium?
And the answer is simply because of people's self-interest.
So if you're a seller and you're trying to sell pencils,
but the price is too high,
you actually want to lower the price
so that you can make at least some money selling the pencils.
You make zero money selling the pencils
for too high of a price.
So sellers want to lower the price,
and buyers, if the price is too low,
actually want to raise the price
because if you're offering too low of a price,
the seller just won't sell to you.
So you want to raise the price so you can get something.
So sellers are pushing the price down,
buyers are pushing the price up,
and the only logical stopping point is equilibrium.
So just by people's natural self-interest,
the price is going to be pushed to the equilibrium point.
And the basic idea here of what's going on
is that your plans are functions of other people's plans.
And so to accomplish your plans,
you need to make your plan consistent
with everyone else's plan,
not because you care about them,
but just because you're selfish.
And the price is the variable you can manipulate
to make everyone's plans congruent with everyone else's.
So everyone's just naturally trying to bring things
to equilibrium.
So what happens if there's a new stress?
And this is really going to be kind of the key section here.
So let's say that you are writing something down
when all of a sudden your pencil breaks
and you need to go buy a new one.
If the system's in equilibrium,
then as we saw every pencil plan to be sold
is already planned to be bought.
So there's not an easy way for you to get a pencil
based on existing prices.
So what you need to do is bid up the price of pencils
to out-compete other buyers.
You need to convince a seller to sell you a pencil
by raising that price.
And so what we get is this diagram.
So this was the old demand.
And then because you want to buy more pencils now,
there's new demand based on your new plan.
And there are two key facts about this.
One is you can see the intersection point,
which is the equilibrium price has moved up.
And the quantity of pencils in the market
has also gone up as well from about 25 to about 30 or so.
So price goes up and quantity goes up
when you plan to buy more pencils.
And what this does is this is the stress sharing mechanic.
So you bid up the price of pencils
just because it helps you,
it gives you better chances of acquiring a pencil.
But because you're connected to everyone else
the price system, this transmits your stress to them.
So an increase in price stresses out buyers, right?
They see the higher price, they go,
whoa, I was planning to buy a bunch of pencils.
Now that's harder to do.
So I don't want to buy as many pencils,
which is exactly what you need.
That leaves more pencils available for you.
And similarly, an increase in price excites sellers.
They go, oh boy, I want to sell a bunch of pencils
now and make money,
which again makes more pencils available for you to buy.
So just by bidding up the price of pencils,
you're communicating your stress to everybody
without you necessarily even realizing you're doing so.
It just happens anyway.
And it looks like they're generously choosing
to help you out.
But in reality, what's going on is they just can't tell,
is this stress mine or his?
In fact, they don't even know about you.
So they're not even asking that question.
They're just seeing I'm stressed out,
so I got to behave differently and that takes care of you.
And so this is the diagram, right?
So you're stressed out, price goes up, everyone's stressed out.
So if this diagram makes intuitive sense at this point,
then we basically accomplished the primary goal.
So what we can see is that prices achieve mind melding
and the expansion of perceptual fields,
which is what we need for large scale collective intelligence.
So as we've seen when you bid up the price of a pencil,
your stress becomes the buyer's stress
and the reward you would receive from a pencil
becomes the reward of sellers because they make more money.
So we've got stress sharing, we have reward sharing.
And what this does is it causes perceptual fields
to get bigger.
Everyone acts as if they know about your plans
and they change their behavior to fit with what you're doing,
just because the price went up.
And this is basically what lets people make pencils.
The task of creating a pencil is too large
for any one individual on their own to understand.
But because of the way that perceptual fields get expanded,
everyone's able to see what they need to see
to make the system work.
And one important thing as well is that the system
depends on the competition among the subunits
to achieve this cooperative outcome.
So suppose a pencil seller tries to cheat the system
and pretend that there's a new stress in the economy
and raise the price of pencils to make more money.
What this would immediately do is incentivize
all of the other pencil sellers to undercut them
and steal their customers.
So lying and trying to cheat the system in some way,
immediately you get punished by your competition,
we're gonna take advantage of your poor decision
to make more money.
And so my hypothesis is that all collective intelligence
has worked this way.
We're all bound together by cognitive blues,
such as bioelectricity that are in some way
mathematically analogous to the price system.
I think there's one way to do this.
It's this basic abstract economic system.
So what justifies calling this, I think,
a collective intelligence is a shared model perspective.
So prices are a set of publicly available
electronically transmitted numbers
that condense a huge amount of decentralized information,
which means they constitute a model of relative scarcities.
And it's a shared model
because we all see the same set of prices.
And so if we just think about like
an active inference internal model thing,
it seems like you can associate a self to an internal model.
So if everyone has the same model,
then everyone's part of the same self,
so it's a collective intelligence.
And what this enables to happen
because everyone's sharing the same model
is everyone perceives the predictions
in an active inference sense
of the expected perceptions and planned behaviors
of everyone else, which makes it very easy
to figure out how to achieve your goals
while not interfering with
and therefore being interfered with by
other people's goals.
So to return to the original question
of how we're able to build a pencil,
this is the basic picture of how that works.
So all of the facts necessary
to coordinate people across space and time
are things that some individual is aware of.
Maybe it's someone, a worker on the ground
or a CEO high up in the company,
but everyone has some piece of the puzzle
and they incorporate that piece of the puzzle
into their plans because they're just,
that's what people do.
They take their information and they plan on that basis.
Then those plans as we've seen through supply and demand
are condensed into prices
such that updates to relevant information
cause updates to plans, which cause updates to prices.
So this is this diagram.
So information causes plans, causes prices,
and then changes in information,
yield changes in plans, which make changes in prices.
And so then all people have to do
rather than having to think,
how do I make my information congruent with Mike's
or how do I make my plan congruent with his?
All I need to do is make my plan congruent with prices,
which is easy to do
because I know what the prices are
and I know how much money I have,
which then unwittingly makes my behavior
congruent with your behavior as well.
And so the simple signaling system allows everyone,
you know, in the US, Mexico, Brazil, China, et cetera,
to coordinate with each other
without realizing they're doing so.
And fascinatingly, this causes
a massive scaling of plans and goals.
So an ordinary human on their own
just plans to like acquire food and shelter
so they don't get eaten.
But when you combine people into the system,
all of a sudden people start planning
to create millions of commercial grade pencils every year.
So this system really scales up people's goals
by making it highly attainable to achieve those goals.
One interesting note about this is that
if you can prove that this is how organisms work,
then you would prove that cells are agents
because one obvious way to think about agents
is that agents are entities that take information
and turn that information into plans.
So if you can see that the biological system
is doing this, then the only way to make sense
that would be that cells are agents.
So just a fun little note there.
So one important point as well.
So we can see how helpful prices are to us.
Why are they so helpful to us?
And the answer, of course, is their own self-interest.
They're just trying to help themselves.
So the price system has two goals.
It's to be an accurate model
and it's to be a rational model
of the relative scarcities of all goods.
And I suspect that's the goal of all models
to be rational and accurate.
So just a reminder, scarcity is the availability
of a good relative to people's plans.
The more people plan to use it, the less of the more scarcities.
Relative scarcity is the scarcity of one good
compared to the scarcity of another good.
So what accuracy means in this context
is that if apples are priced twice as high as oranges,
so if apples cost $2 and oranges cost $1,
then accuracy means that apples
are actually twice as scarce as oranges.
The prices really are attracting the relative scarcities.
And irrationality just means rationality
in a Bayesian sense, like prices should update
as a random walk, not moving in a predictable direction.
And the way we know prices have these goals
is because they pay people to improve
its accuracy and rationality.
If you're a stock trader or a commodity trader or something
and you can make the system more accurate
or make the system more rational,
you can become very wealthy.
So the price system effectively pays us
to make it more accurate and rational,
which is exactly what we need in turn
to enable a large-scale coordination.
So this takes us to a primary conclusion
and then we'll have a couple of miscellaneous slides after.
So what I think is the basic things
you need to have collective intelligence.
And I think this should be a universal principle.
You need some kind of system
that collects all relevant information
and condenses it into a single shared set
of mathematically useful objects,
like prices, which are numbers.
Numbers are very convenient.
You want these objects to be something
that interacts with the subunits of the collective,
such as the humans or the cells, whatever,
such that they persuade people
to behave in the intended way,
which then allow you to manipulate these prices
or whatever other objects to get the system to do anything
it can conceivably do, as we'll see on the next slide.
You need the system to incorporate new
and updated information and have that transmit rapidly
and accurately through the system,
which is what the stock market does.
You also need a process for inducing honesty and accuracy
in communicating information, such as competition.
And the result of all of this needs to be a shared model
that is an accurate and rational model of relative scarcities,
relative scarcities being what sums up the congruences
and conflicts between everyone's plans.
So if everyone can see something
that models the relative scarcities,
everyone's going to be able to act in ways
that are consistent with how everyone else is acting.
So this right here, I think, is the basic details
any collective intelligence needs to have
and is going to have.
So a few, a couple of miscellaneous points here.
So I'm arguing prices are analogous to bioelectricity,
which means they should be the morphological code
of the economy, and indeed they are.
So this is an example I got off Twitter.
So taxes are like an artificial way
of manipulating the price system.
You can raise the price above what it would otherwise be.
And as we can see, if you tax windows,
you don't get many windows.
If you tax roofs, you don't get many roofs.
If you tax frontage, you don't get a lot of frontage.
If you tax finished buildings,
you don't get a lot of finished buildings.
So economists believe that in principle,
you can get the economy to do anything
that could conceivably do just by manipulating prices
up and down, which is very convenient
if all you have to do is manipulate prices
because that leaves the problem solving up to the subunits.
So a high price says supply more of this and buy less of this,
but how to supply more of it and how to live with less of it
is left up to the subunits and their competencies.
So just as an example, if you want less carbon
dioxide in the air as we all should,
then you can just raise, put a tax on carbon dioxide
and then the challenge of how to adjust to that new price
is left up to people's and businesses.
So managing the system in principle is very easy
as long as you can move prices up and down.
And then the final point here is
what if there's a flaw in the system?
What if there's a missing link?
So the system works very well
as long as everything relevant is being tracked, accounted for
and condensed into the price system.
But what if there's something
that doesn't get into the price system for whatever reason?
Whatever that is, it's called an externality.
So an example is just carbon dioxide like we just saw.
It's not priced properly.
So the effects of it aren't included in the price.
So people end up doing stuff they shouldn't do,
like over consuming, like buying SUVs and things like that.
I believe that externality is analogous to cancer.
Cancer is an example of externality.
So a firm producing excess pollution is doing so
because that activity isn't tied to the rest of the economy
via the price system.
So it treats the rest of the economy
like the external environment as something to dump waste into
rather than to take care of.
So I believe basically externality explains economic tumors
and relatedly, externality causes developmental disorders.
So if there's something like weird going on in a firm
that doesn't make sense
or if the economy is creating goods and services
that it shouldn't create,
that's always going to be because of an externality.
And externality is kind of my thing.
So if externality interests you,
check out my paper on my website,
The Problem of Externality in 2024
for more information about how that works.
That takes me to the end of this.
Thank you very much for sitting through this.
Here's my contact information.
And if this sort of theme interests you,
I have an essay on my website, Prices as Memories,
which goes into more detail about some of what's going on here.
So thanks very much for sitting through that.
I hope that was interesting and educational.
And I'll just turn it over to you now.
What do you want to discuss?
Thanks, wow.
Yeah, extremely interesting.
A couple of things.
First of all, in this system,
which we consistently with our multi-scale
competency architectures,
the individual subunits that are acting on the price,
buying and selling, they're rational agents, right?
So they have a little bit of intelligence themselves
that allows them to execute these policies
based on the price.
Can we talk a little bit about or say what you think about,
what's the minimal set of things that they need to know
and be able to do for this all to work?
What's the, how smart do they actually need to be?
I believe it's extremely minimal.
So the basic concept of rationality
is a preference order.
Let me see if I can draw something for you.
Maybe this is unnecessary,
but let me pull up and I don't need to do it on a computer.
Let me just show you.
So the basic concept of rationality
is you have preferences as set
and then rationality is a complete and transitive order.
So I'm just drawing something here.
If this is, I don't know if this is visible,
but if you can just see these three dots
connected by these lines,
this is a rational preference order.
This is an extremely simple structure
that exists literally everywhere.
If you have this, you have rationality.
This is the minimal competence necessary.
So yeah, part of why this is something
that like I noticed very early in undergrad
and part of why I'm attracted to your work.
It's like rationality should be everywhere.
It's in no way restricted to humans at its core.
It's a very simple, very basic thing.
So yeah, so I can see,
can you just connect the dots a little bit more?
I'd like, definitely preference order
is something that is common in biology.
Why do you get from preference order to, you know,
draw the loop for me.
So the price that you can, you know,
you have a sensor that can sense the current price,
something like that.
You have some kind of another interstate
that says how much do I need, whatever this is.
Like, can we just sketch out what's the minimal agent here
that you need to participate in the system?
Yes, so you would have preferences over,
well in principle potentially every possible state
of the world, but at least when we're considering
a standard shopping example,
preferences over different bundles of goods.
You've got the amount of money you have.
And then let's say you've got $10,
like apples are $1 and oranges are $2.
You could buy like 10 apples and zero oranges
or like, you know, four apples and three oranges, et cetera.
And so the basics of economics
is you arrange all of those possible bundles
into an order based on preference
where you're most preferred at the top all the way down.
Then you just buy your most preferred options.
That's the basic competence.
Can you take your options such as your shopping bundles
and arrange them in a list
where you can then select your favorite one on that list.
And if you have any ability to do that in any sense,
and actually working on a couple of papers
arguing that that power does exist
to a much greater degree than people realize.
So actually this is interesting.
I'm working on some stuff about how human beings
are diverse cognition.
In human beings themselves,
cognition does not work the way people think it does.
And economics exists in human beings in places
where people don't realize.
So you don't necessarily need to see people
making like shopping lists
as long as there's some ability to create an ordering
over things that in some way map to options,
you're good to go.
But presumably there's some,
if you were trying to implement this,
either somebody makes an offer,
I wanna sell you this for this price.
And you can compare that with what's the,
you know, what's the calculus that you then do to decide
what are you actually willing to pay?
So there's two things there.
So the basic calculus is you're really comparing it
to your opportunity cost.
You're comparing it to your other best option and saying,
you know, is this worth, if I don't,
if I do this, I don't do something else,
is that worth doing?
So that's what you're comparing
is your two different plans,
your two different predictions.
The price itself is all relative.
So this is actually a key point.
I'm glad you brought it up.
Prices just track relative scarcity.
So the only thing that matters is the relative prices.
So if apples are $2 and oranges cost $1,
or if apples are $4 and oranges cost $2,
it's the same situation.
So the price is almost secondary in a way.
The only thing that matters
is that it should be in some way a mirror
of the relative scarcities as in ordering.
But in order to, that's very interesting,
but in order to do what you just said,
to say this over that,
you have to have what counterfactuals?
You have to have the ability to consider counterfactuals
or store memories of other options or like...
Yes.
So what I'm basically working on in these papers,
do you know Paul?
I think it's pronounced Chisek,
Paul Chisek's work at all.
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, so he's got this action selection hypothesis,
I think is really congruent
with some recent findings in neuroscience.
And basically what's happening in the human brain,
and I suspect similarly in other organisms,
though I don't know,
is you are, when you're considering an option,
you're actually constructing several options simultaneously.
So like a motor behavior,
I'm constructing a bunch of different possible motor behaviors
all at once in my brain
and anticipating how they're going to plan out.
And basically very, very quickly,
the brain compares all of these different options
by just,
they compete with each other like literally in your head
and like kind of fight almost for dominance over the brain,
whichever one wins that competition
is probably your best option.
And then that gets implemented
as a result of winning that competition.
So you do literally construct alternatives
and have them compete.
And this is actually interesting
because economists for a long time,
you don't feel yourself doing that.
So economists thought,
well, this is just like an as if,
you're not really doing this,
but it's just useful for modeling you.
I think actually neuroscience shows
that this is literally happening.
And so I'm actually,
I have a paper title beyond as if,
kind of describing some of this stuff.
So I do think this literally happens,
you do construct alternatives in your head.
I suspect cells do the same thing,
although I don't know.
Yeah, it may well be.
I'm thinking now we should take a look
at how to cash out that kind of model
in terms of, for example,
transcriptional decisions, physiological decisions.
What does it look like to be teeing up
a bunch of different transcripts?
Like gene expression,
change responses in following some sort of stimulus
or a stressor or something,
and then having to choose one
and the idea that they can compete with each other.
It's interesting.
We'll have to see what that would look like for cells.
Okay, let's see what else.
It's really interesting to me that,
that the pricier plays a number of different roles,
which is much like what we've been thinking about
for some of the things in the biology,
kind of morphogenesis field,
which is, so in a certain sense,
it's the middle node of some kind of bow type, right?
Because it encompasses,
in a very compressed representation,
a huge amount of other information,
but also from that,
it has all these fan out consequences,
and that it sort of encodes that.
To what extent, so okay, so there's that,
then there's the thing you pointed out
about the shared model, right?
That it's also encodes some kind of shared view
of the world and it's binding everybody together
into the same picture of the world.
At the same time, it's a control knob,
because by impacting that,
probably should get to have
all sorts of interesting consequences,
what widely, and as you point out at the end,
it also has a perspective and a degree of agency,
because the price itself has certain interests in this,
which I think is one of the most interesting things.
That aspect, like watching how things
can run that spectrum and can be simultaneously,
though all of the play all of those roles,
I think is very interesting.
And I wonder if we can say more,
could we say, in the system you've described,
there are a number of layers
that you can try to imagine taking the perspective of,
right, so obviously the easiest for us
is the individual humans that,
or the individual pieces that react to the price,
but could we say, for example,
what does the world look like
from the perspective of the price itself, right?
What is its world?
And I'm talking about the kind of thing that,
you know, when Randy Beer does this cognitive domain
of a glider, that kind of thing,
that when you're looking at really unconventional agents
and minimal patterns and things like that
and asking what does the world look like
from their perspective.
Yeah, why don't we just start there?
What do you think the world looks like
if you're the price?
Yes, I have given that some thought.
I don't think I've come up with anything terribly useful,
but what does occur to me is that, you know,
what the price seems to naturally want to do
is to preserve itself.
It wants to preserve its relationship with other prices.
It doesn't want to change in any kind of predictable way,
just like an organism.
And it naturally achieves that just by the equilibrium price
just incentivizes people not to mess with it,
except as new information comes in,
which then should update the equilibrium price.
So it does seem to me there is at least some kind of
minimal model which you can think of prices.
Something like an organism that's trying to maintain
allostasis and buyer.
I have no idea what that is.
Did I cut out?
Yeah, there's something.
I can, but there's something going on with your Wi-Fi, I think.
Yeah, it might be a little unstable.
It seems better now.
I mean, you're cut up now.
Did I cut off there?
Did you get all that?
Yeah, I think I got it, yeah.
Is there any notion of, you know, like right now,
the price is a single scalar and that's great for many things
because it's an enormous compression into a simple thing.
Is there any idea about what would happen if it were richer,
some kind of a higher dimensional concept?
Yeah, people have talked about that.
I'm not too familiar with any specific models.
Right now, just getting everything incorporated
into the scalars is hard enough.
I do think that's a rich area for potential exploration,
but I don't have any specific idea about it.
Okay, and similar to the question
about the perspective of the price itself,
what do you think, you know, usually in biology,
what we have is we have the organism
and then we sort of start asking questions
about the cognitive glue and how the pieces actually add up.
So in this case, we're kind of going backwards
because everybody believes that the individuals are agents,
but then, you know, there's this cognitive glue
that you've identified that binds them together.
What do you think the collective is doing?
In other words, again, looking at it
from the perspective of the collective,
having been bound together by this economic model,
what are the goals, the preferences, the competencies,
what does, you know, the economy,
I guess is what we're talking about.
What do you think, what does the world look like
from its perspective?
I think the answer to that is analogous
to the answer for an individual,
which is less semantically clear than people believe.
So like as an individual, when we talk about our goals,
it's easy to say, oh, my goal is to like do some economics
thing, but in reality, that's not really what's going on.
My goal is to achieve allostasis by managing my metabolism
and like energy regulating the ins and outs
of what's going on with my body.
I think that's also true of the price system.
You could say, oh, like it's trying to make pencils
or trying to do this or that.
Really, it's trying to achieve allostasis,
which it does by coordinating all of the subunits,
getting everything to work together.
That is in principle, its only goal, I believe.
Do you think that there's the active inference perspective,
like something like surprise minimization
would be applicable to that agent?
Absolutely.
And I borrowed a lot from that perspective
and it was moving away from economics
to some neuroscience.
Like I keep bringing up Lisa Feldman-Baird.
I have a quote I have to mention my name once,
every time we talk.
Her work helped me make a lot of progress
and then prepared me to understand your work as well.
So I think that's big and I wish more economists
were aware of that.
Got it.
Do you think that the system as a whole is trainable?
In other words, is there a notion of memory here
that you could, you know, future behavior,
some kind of history says historicity,
like future behavior would be different
based on the history of prior stimuli?
Yes, it's a bit tricky to give a clear answer to this
because I think it gets so mixed up
with the trainability of humans and firms.
Like the economy is trainable,
but that's not surprising to economists
because people are trainable.
So there is a great deal of research
about how like firms learn
and like based on previous instances,
they'll then change how they're gonna behave in the future.
The trainability of just the price system itself,
I suppose it's conceivable that maybe certain,
I don't know, like elasticities
might be influenced by past behavior,
but I don't have any specific ideas.
So right now I'd say it's a little tricky
to disambiguate that from just the trainability of people
and people made organizations such as businesses.
I think we actually,
so this might be an interesting thing
for us to do some research on
because I think actually you can disambiguate it
by analogy to what we did in gene regulatory networks.
So if you have a model of gene regulatory networks,
which is just a set of coupled differential equations
that say how each gene turns the other genes on and off,
we showed six different kinds of learning,
including pavlovian conditioning in that model,
but specifically the pieces A were completely dumb,
so they did not learn.
So unlike in what you're talking about now,
the nodes themselves have zero learning capacity,
all they have is state,
so they just have whatever their current,
they don't have any memory,
they don't have any of that,
they just have whatever my current state is,
that's all I know, so zero memory.
And that's A and B,
what you're also not allowed to do in these models
is change the topology of the network.
In other words, how strong are the connections?
So the typical things you would do to train a network like that,
which is to adjust the synaptic weight, right?
And the connections between the nodes,
you're not allowed to change that,
the network is completely fixed.
So no intelligence in the nodes,
no changes of the topology,
and yet just from the dynamical systems behavior
of certain not alls,
it's not a universal thing,
the way that some of like, for example,
Stu Kaufman's origins of order in that network stuff is,
which is just like widely applicable to random networks.
This isn't like that random networks
don't do this as well as biological networks.
So I think evolution actually has probably selected
for ones that are good at this,
but nevertheless,
there are plenty of networks that can learn
without what the piece is being completely done.
So I wonder if we had an economic model where you clamp,
so an in silico computationally economic model,
you clamp the behavior of the individual,
so they cannot learn.
Probably we can even clamp,
we can even clamp the relationships between them,
but we examine the behavior of the system after stimuli
that are patterned in the way that behavioral scientists do it
for, you know, for testing habituation,
sensitization, pathology and conditioning, whatever.
I wonder if we would see learning there.
My conjecture is that we would.
I think this, my guess is that this is a very widespread
capacity and I think we could potentially show that
if you clamp the behavior of the individuals.
I'd be inclined to agree
because I do just think these systems should be analogous.
I'm wondering now,
so there's a Nobel Prize winner, Vernon Smith,
who became sort of known for doing economic experiments,
which we usually can't do very well.
I wonder if there are some analogies in his work.
So maybe I'll try to read up a little bit
on the gene regulatory stuff
and see if I can find any connections
to anything Vernon Smith has done.
Maybe not, but it's worth exploring.
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
You know, and I wonder as you look at the GRN stuff,
I wonder if we can define, for example, in these networks,
what would be the equivalent of the price, right?
Could we say that by watching their behavior?
Actually, how about this?
Do you think that watching,
it's like a weird touring test.
If I showed a bunch of economists
the behavior of some system, some distributed system,
could they say that,
hey, this absolutely looks like an economy,
or no, it does not?
Is that something that,
or can you make anything look like an economy,
in which case we could actually do the mapping
and figure out what is the price in this GRN?
That's an interesting question.
I never thought about that.
I suspect that most economists would just,
because their academics just be cautious
about drawing any conclusions
that haven't been hard verified,
but that's an interesting question.
I'd be very interested in seeing the results.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's very interesting.
That's worth exploring for sure.
Yeah, I mean, one way to get started with that
is if you identify for me,
what does an economic data set look like?
That is, what does an economics,
so if you were gonna say to a colleague,
okay, I'm gonna show you the parameters
of this economic system, what do they expect to see?
What does the data look like?
What are they looking for?
Is it prices over time or distributed,
the buys and sells, or what are they looking for?
I bet if we understood the format of that,
I could give you a data set.
We could do a blind thing
where I wouldn't tell you what it really was.
You can show it to people and they say,
oh, a classic case of an economy of this type,
and then we could find out that actually,
this is a bunch of cells communicating during,
I don't know, axial determination or something.
I think it would be interesting to use that
as a way of finding these kinds of mappings, you know?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense.
I will look into that.
That's a really good idea.
I think that'd be fun.
All right, and I guess, okay, the last question
that came to my mind is this, does all of this,
does everything you've said today
assume a perfect efficiency, like immediate,
instantaneous transfer of information,
all that kind of stuff?
No, but of course, you won't achieve
like perfect outcomes without it,
but no, you don't need that to have something
that's perfection within a body,
but I still feel like myself,
and I believe the same is true of the economy.
And then as technology improves,
we will, of course, improve the efficiency of it.
Right now, a tremendous amount of people
are not terribly bound into the economy.
I mean, billions of people are in poverty and so on,
and so over time, that will increase greatly.
But yeah, in the first world,
like certainly the stock market or something like that
is bound to get it tightly enough,
but I think it's reasonable to think of it this way.
And I'll tell you why I ask,
but I'm also thinking about kind of information efficiencies,
like when you buy, and again,
I know nothing about economics,
so this could be nonsense,
but to me, it seems like when you're selling something,
you wanna get rid of it,
and you think it's a good idea to get rid of it,
and for that to work, somebody else needs to disagree with you
and think that it's a good idea to buy it.
And so there are going to be differences
in how informed people are,
and somebody's gonna make money
because they're more informed than somebody else,
and of course, then people can make bets
on what's gonna happen with the economy
and things like that, right?
So the reason I bring this up is because if you think about,
so let's think about the biological case.
So you gotta set a sales,
and the sales are now coupled by gap junctions, right?
Now, so that's a kind of cognitive glue
because the bioelectric signals
are now spreading through the tissue,
and it's now harder for any one cell to be an outlier
in terms of its memories and its model of the world
because it's sharing physiological parameters
directly with its neighbors,
but in the real world,
it takes time for information to propagate
through that tissue.
And so much like the speed of light
is a kind of like this limit in physics
that binds, that ties together space and time,
there's gonna be a constant like that in any tissue
that basically tells you how fast can information propagate,
right, and how fast it can signals
and information get across the thing.
So you can have scenarios where for some amount of time,
there are going to be regions,
so let's say, so here's your cellular network, your tissue,
something happens over here to trigger it.
There's gonna be some time where the ones over here
know about it and the ones back here don't yet.
So I wonder to what extent,
and you can also think about that Delta
having something to do with the thickness
of the cognitive now moment, right,
that you're not instantaneous,
there's about a couple of hundred milliseconds
in neuroscience, they tell you that
is when the things are propagated.
And below that, you can't really answer questions,
did I see it, was I aware of it?
You can only answer those questions definitively
from the perspective of the larger cognitive agent
from a certain, you know,
after the information has had a chance
to propagate and all the subsystems have had their say
and eventually you can say yes, you did or you didn't.
So there's a temporal resolution, right,
below which you can't really slice yourself,
that temporal thickness.
So I wonder if something like this is going on here
and I wonder if it's also helpful,
if there's any kind of a helpful mapping,
if the things that economists,
I assume economists know a lot about what happens
when there are discrepancies in information
in the economy and the ability to act and so on.
I wonder if some of those things
could help us understand development
or morphogenesis more broadly.
I suspect so.
I mean, information asymmetry is a huge field of research
where like you're trading with someone
who knows more than you about the good.
So you have to ask like, why are they selling this to me?
And that can make it very challenging to create markets.
You also have things like no trade theorems
where like if we're all trading in a stock market,
potentially the only reason you're selling to me
is because you think it's going down.
So like, why would I buy it?
So there are instances where differences in information
can really make it very difficult to trade,
even though at the same time,
the whole point of trading
is to ultimately bring everyone's information
into sync with each other.
So yes, there is a tremendous amount of research about that
in both finance and information asymmetry economics.
And that's something that could be incorporated in some way.
Okay, yeah, the Wi-Fi is really-
And maybe I cut out again.
Yeah, yeah, it's really acting up.
I guess the last thing I'll just suggest
and this is something we can do in later work is
like I think you've painted an amazing picture
of the parallels between the two systems.
And I think the other complementary thing we can do
is look at the parallels of the disorders.
So the various ways that economics goes bad
and have various breakdowns of optimal functioning.
I wonder if we can map that onto specific disorders
in other spaces in living systems.
I wonder if there's a version of,
I don't know, developmental defects, cancer,
failure to repair, all those kinds of things.
Yeah, I think cancer is an externality.
And externality is sort of the generalization
of all of those issues.
Currently, economists have a very hard time
talking about externality.
It's actually hard to make it consistent with economics.
So I have a paper on my website talking about that issue,
actually citing some of your work
as to how we could try to make progress on that.
So I believe those parallels are definitely there
and I have been thinking about it.
And what we might actually need is biologists
to figure out cancer and then use that
so we can solve externality.
So the direction might flow that way.
Yeah, I think that's very interesting to think about
which direction, probably both, but the insights could flow.
I mean, we've had some luck normalizing cancer,
at least in the amphibian models
who are moving onto mammals now and to human cells now,
but we've had some really good luck in frog models.
So we could think about what that might be.
But I think in general,
some research that we could do together
would be to get hold of a computational model.
I assume there are computer models of simple
or maybe not simple economic systems
that people can play with.
So actually, computational models
have not been huge in economics
because they haven't been able to tell us
anything that's surprising.
And so actually what I've been thinking about,
because you mentioned this before,
is maybe they could make a comeback
because it would be surprising just
to see economics in biology.
And so I'm not familiar at all with computational economics,
but I do believe that is a very useful path.
And relatedly, one thing I've been thinking about
is there's a field called economic geography
which explains why does finance end up in New York
and tech end up in San Francisco.
I think that could be useful for explaining
why does your heart end up here
and your kidney end up where it is.
So I think computational models could be interesting
in that context,
but I currently don't know anything about them.
So I definitely have to do some studying.
Yeah, let me know what you turn up to.
I think it would be cool.
I mean, I remember from a hundred years ago,
like lemonade stand, right?
Like you could easily, something as simple as that.
And probably that one I'm guessing is too simple,
but there must be things for students to play with.
And that where if we rip the graphic interface off of it
and use the underlying computations,
we could test things like,
can we induce and repair various disorders
in the biology focused way?
Can we try the learning and the training?
Can we use it to generate data sets to compare
to other things and see if economists
can actually pick out which one's the economy
and which one's the morphogenetic signaling,
all those things.
I think we should look into it.
Absolutely, I think so too.
Yeah, that'd be super cool.
