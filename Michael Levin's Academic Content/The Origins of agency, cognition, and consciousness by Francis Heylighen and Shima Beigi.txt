I already told Michael this is a little bit improvised. I was supposed to give this last
week but then I was ill so I could be paid and in the meantime I have done a bit of hope but
still not as much as I would have liked to do but I think it will be interesting.
So what I'm trying to do here is for the first time to do a research part
in busy with one on the origin of goldite, one on the origin of human consciousness.
Ah okay. So what the two projects have in common is that they're both about agency which is a topic
I think that in your lawyer you also have been thinking about. So agency first of all means
means goldness, seeds that are moving to the goal in order that they need to be able to
mess up the conditions in which then they should be able to make the right actions.
That is the main theme but then I want to go to a higher level of agency the human consciousness
where you're not only acting reflexively but you are able to choose between different different
causes of action and that will allow me to put a first attack tackling the circle called heart
problem of consciousness. So that's briefly what I want to go out on. So let's start the first part
which is about a goal directedness or actually about a life. So all living systems are there
because they have survived natural selection means they have been selected to be fit and to
be fitted means that they should be able to survive and go if they are not capable to achieve
that goal of surviving and going well they simply simply are elated. So we can assume all living
systems have this inflow of survival and survival they can maintain their metabolism
is of perturbations because the world is not always the same. So this I will summarize as agency
living systems have the implicit role of wanting to survive, wanting to maintain them in themselves
in order to do that they need to that means they need to be able to support opportunities
surpassing perturbations and in order to act they need to have some kind of implicit cognition
namely they need to know what action is appropriate for what perturbations. So that's the basic
framework let's now go into more detail about how that could have evolved. So the best
definition of living systems that I know is the same as one of Maturana Eila autopoiesis.
Autopoiesis means the existence is self-prothrording it forms it's a network of processes
that reconstitutes all and Maturana and Eila automatically connect this notion of cognition
to their notion of autopoiesis because each system should be able to be able to produce itself
it should also be able to withstand any perturbations that may push it to want to self-maintenance
so it needs to have this cognition. The theory of autopoiesis Maturana Eila is really I would say
really difficult abstract sometimes confusing so I have tried to make a simpler version of it
that is a version where that is based on the network of processes where processes then
can be defined formally. Autopoietic system network of processes is something that some
input then forms that input into some output so it produces new components it consumes other
components or it transforms certain components into other components and then the definition
of autopoiesis is that the components being produced by these processes are such that they
never generate the same processes that started them so they very simply put the processes
autopoietic system system produce components while the components produce the person the whole thing
is self-generating self-producing. So to make that clear I start from what I call a first ontology
that means I do not assume that universe is constituted of objects where objects are inert
materials which ultimately people tend to tend to see as particles I see the universe consisting
out of process and a process is something that we can describe formally as action a reaction
meaning you have some input things some they react with each other and you get an output and then a
system such as an apoietic system then becomes appellate network of processes so instead of
start on stable elements of I assume it's stability is the result of process that
somehow some are tabularis
so what are reactions a reaction is kind of like the minimal element of my ontology
a reaction assumes that there are conditions which are distinguishable states of it's over there
condition can be the presence of particular molecule of part of biological physical species
but also it may be something much more a social condition of worlds or over this
anything that can be distinguished from its absence is a condition and then processes
represented by errors could be for example that
a distinguishable condition appears a is formed and this variable condition disappears
a condition is transformed into a different condition and some some combinations reactions
react react to form a combination of conditions so this is
a kind of mechanism that is very similar to the one used today or in element elementary
partition but the a b c these that are right here they can be any distinguishable conditions
so it wasn't an an elementary apoietic system it's a system that produce itself but of course
it must be term dynamically open that means it must have input from outside and there will be
some some dissipation with some waste waste so in this case i need to have need to have some
in the of a some outlay of b and then a and a and being themselves now that's of course much too
simple to have a a living system so let's look at it and somewhat more complicated example
complicated example in the sense that i have still an input i still have still still have
in between i have a lack of reaction that that's much more complicated but that but that is such
that every everything every every component we condition them the base the cities there is
always always something produces it something appears disappears nothing nothing of nothing
everything is produced by some reaction and the whole reaction thing is keeping itself going
so so uh for those who are interested this kind of a mathematical model
all the chemical organization is something called chemical chemical organizing theory in which
which you can look at the conditions and a network of work of reactions becomes
also the apoietic apoietic meaning meaning self meaning and closed closed that whatever is consumed
is produced whatever is produced is consumed so now uh where does all the boyans is come from
that's kind of the assumption of my ontology that is that process is self organized into
more more complicated organizations and so how i have that that in the simplest
i i start with a random reaction sections random content means any any a plus b c plus
we have we have payments with that we have just generated random that random network
sign then we have seen what seen what happens is typically that itself organizes into nothing
kind of autopoietic how does that happen to start with a number of components that are available
components or conditions you have the reactions the reactions form the components into components
which come themselves out as something something the new components are on
when you start with a number of components components you produce on this you add you add
the new one up to the point that you point that you can along the ones because there is no material
available to available to add anything there yet on the other hand some of the some of the
come up consumed but they are not produced or not produced enough to keep the whole thing going so
you remove them in the end what are you left with with components that are being produced
that are being consumed but such that that they are they are being put and consumed and at the same
time so this is a formal reason that i'm not sketching quickly for those institutes you can look
at look at my papers the chemical organization the autopoiesis is what is that a self-made
cook of the actress is an attacker of the dynamics that means that if you let the dynamics
hurt on its own eventually you will get something that resembles an autopoietic system or in most
case that the autopoietic system will trivial but in principle you can generate an autopoietic system
like like that to self-organization now what one thing to get to is that the autopoietic system
should not maintain itself in deal circumstances that mean ideal circumstances where over all the
inputs components are not there but in in the absence of an environment where things are not
always available sometimes there are conditions that are interfering with your reactions sometimes
the conditions you need for your reactions are not there so i've said that the autopoietic
regime is an actor but there will be a patient that will be pushing the system out of its
attacker so if we think about the autopoietic system as a kind of a very primitive organism that
organ lacks food so even at the moment there's not enough influence it will die on the other hands
it it may die because of toxin that means components that interfere with the reactions
that are necessary to the whole thing alive so first stage is the system of organizing is
into something self-maintaining maintaining second age that self-maintaining system being
turned around by perturbants most most of them are killed are killed off by perturbations
but eventually we we may assume evolution will lead to another to another system that's resilient
resilient that means that it is able to bounce back from these perturbations that there are all
kind of changes happening in the environment it can somehow compensate for these perturbations
that means for example some some components of here that's previously worked as toxins that
means they're perturbing the metabolism your version of the paedic system the more resilient
will have some way to neuter these toxins since if for example the food available maybe it will
have developed some internal reactions to digest a different type of food so i'm assuming that if
the process of evolution goes on long enough the system will become more and more resilient
we have done a number of simulations with these networks and indeed you see that if you give it
enough time the time it tends to become resilient so so what does it mean in terms of
dynamic systems it it means that the auto system is an attack it's basically
of attack means all all the options that lead to the to the attack become exciting or become
wider it will have a wider range of viability so let's imagine this is the dark green that you see
is the attacker that means that is the autopoietic regime which the system tries to turn the light
in is the base that means all of the different regulations from which the autopoietic system
can back to its its regime of symptoms a partition then means means any unregulated
change that makes the system move from one position to another as long as the perturbations
remain inside the basin they will automatically be compensated because as long as the system is
in the basin it will on its own go to the reactor if on the other hand perturbation can
push the system outside of the basin then it will no longer go with the attacker which
which means that basically that autopoietic system longer autopoietic
that cannot maintain itself what could potentially potentially happen is also a different attack
the tractor potentially could be could be even better let's not discuss that here
so that allows me now to define the directness as resilient autopoiesis
autopoiesis is the attractor resilient autopoiesis this means if you perturb it from the
attractor if you put it out of the attractor it will come back it has a one basin and basin
is is ongoing process of self-main so it's not an equilibrium like
a term system goes to thermo thermodynamic that is not a living system a living system
is a process that is actively self-maintaining that is consuming and producing
so operation what does that mean a goal directed system if it's not in goal it will
move towards the goal if it's in the goal it will stay in goal if it perturbed that
means if it's pushed out of its goal it will it will perform action that kind of requires energy
so as so as to eternal so that so that's we might kind of a minimal thing of
goldness in living living systems a basic basic form of aid now we go to the issue of cognition
so goal directed activity we can say requires a minimum form of cognition because it needs
to be able to compensate the deviations from the rule so if we look from the inside autopoietic
system it undergoes a deviation it should it should somehow to some that there is that there is a
deviation that that means it needs some ability of person of something thing and it should also
have an ability to perform an action that means one of its repertoire of reactions should switch on
so as to neutralize the deviation and implicit in this whole dynamic is the notion of knowledge
namely action that's triggered by this condition should be appropriate for that that condition
so this should somehow know which action to perform for each condition and that now model model with
additional format is used in AI action rules so function rules you have an agent the agent has
a number of function action rules that means to recognize there's a certain condition for example
it senses that there is condition x and it knows if i'm in condition then i should perform action
and we can help with that simply as a process x to i that process in one of the the processes inside
this complex network processes that in poetic system system now cognition mission
are lots of definitions definitions of and we need to be need to be careful about what we mean by
cognition so one of the more interesting results from cyber ethics is so-called the law of regulatory
models are proposed by common MSP and it says if you want to have a directed system standard
goal direct system must include some kind of mapping which they would they call a model
namely it should map all the potential deviation perturbations the right action that means for
each deviation there should one specific action that mapping exists then the system is able to
a control to a reach goal and that's model we might say implement the systems
now model is a common term i'm thinking about evolution the system has a model of its environment
but that is not the way the way that materiela interpreted right and viala and says that
it's what colander colander may be called is not a represent of the environment what they say is
the is the audit system is autonomous it functions functions in it does not know what is going on
in the external world the only thing that we can know is the deviations its senses it has a
metabolism it has a network processes when one processes is functioning the way it should be
the whole whole poetic system is perturbances that i say something about but it does not know
whilst the deviation so materiela emphasize that this kind of knowledge is subjective
the autopoietic poetic system knows only the things that affect its own autopoietic
autopoiesis it does not represent the environment in some objective way
so now we come to the further evolution so we only have a system that is almost that is
goal direct that has some level of problem but but he can think this cognition should
accent the system be able to adapt adapt its conditions and and what's of if there is a
lot of variation in the environment the conditions will change so that means the system should be
able to sense emotions should be able to interpret the conditions it should be able
to make sense of the conditions that its sense is so it requires that it has some elementary
awareness not not really of what objectively going on in the environment but
in what in what way are changing in the environment so that it affects them itself so
we let let evolution its role the system will need to become more and more and more and more
important so that it can recognize a wider range of conditions and can interpret them and
perform the right types of actions so now this is a scheme that you probably seen
which I borrowed from Michael he called the the cognitive
rivalry I have only the cone of OS so if an agent that is situated somewhere middle of
that cone agent will to some extent be aware of what is going on in its environment
purely some point of view but still it will to some degree be aware of conditions in the
past in the future in the neighborhood so the cone kind of kind of represents the range
of awareness the kind of kind of range of the system the potential makes sense the more
advanced the system the wider the cone so here is another picture that I took from Michael
here are some examples of cones a very small creature like a pig will have a very small cone
a human can have a very big cone and a dog can have something in between
but now I come I make a very very big jump I started by it by explaining how the poyesis is
which is the augmentation of a single like a bacterium and now I'm making a jump
in human consciousness so let's forget about all big stages modality cellularity
animals nervous systems etc but what is the essence of the different between the cognition
of a bacterium and the cognition of human or in bacteria the way I use the con the the
the cognition is deterministic the the being sense is a part is a particular con performs a
part of particular act always the same condition leads to same action now we speak about higher
organisms organisms and we humans are there but probably others probably apes talking sense
other mammals and maybe both are also there but there is an intermediate decision making
stage that means there is a condition that the organism senses and I know there is a
here I have called reflection of considering different ways of reacting to that condition
condition means that the action follows so a part of reflection action and actually there is no
action I I make some of the conditionation in women I can decide I need to act in this way
or I can decide there is no action words taking so this is what's called free will
we humans have the ability to consider many different causes of and to choose one of them
and that is typically what we will we'll come to this ability of considering different possibilities
now define cause it's easiest to distinguish conscious conscious consciousness so we humans
still have the same level of subconscious reactions like bacteria and like simple organism
we have this kind of automatic involuntary reflex for example if I put my hand on a hot
so I will pull it away immediately I don't need to think about what this is hot it's if my hand
on it on it then it will go therefore I should pull it pull away my I will just pull away my way
my and I may not feel the heat of the of the stuff so that process implemented in the brain
it's modeled as what is not a speed forward process it's a process that goes straight
sense condition to action they stay immediate way there are no details now what's the difference
with with the conscious process a conscious process process that we can monitor we can in
our own mind minds we know what we are thinking we can I mean our thoughts also redirect our
thoughts for example I may distract this I tell myself no you should be busy with that you should
be doing that so conscious processes are processes I define as processes in the mind that can be
monitored that can be examined and that can be redirected of all the different different
many different theories of consciousness that I like the most the one that I think
explained this is also was was complete is so called global neural space theory
theory and the most active active research is Stanis Stanislas and Alma
what the global neural workspace analysis is that there is some kind of a special network
the workspace which functions a bit like a kind of a forum or meeting space where
lots of different process is coming from and part of the building come together and
the process in that work space they are all what all circulate the other term
regulation all the people people call it really or recurrence resonance but the main idea is
it's a process a forward process that means a process that goes in one direction it's a process
that that cycles around and what what is the reason for the cycling
power with activation of neurons in the brain is an active activation past all new
neurons do remain activated so you want to keep some keep some new working memory
you need to recreate the activation and you can and you can only by having the active activation
come back to the sex and then that for me now the essence of what creates the consciousness
by keeping this thought or this perception active in your memory you can inspect this
and if you can inspect it that means other parts of the brain can look at this other
part of the brain intervening and is now what will create the free work so I will
it's best explained with oin so this is the scheme for the conscious process thing
the feed forward propagation so what you have is just a line the sensors some some condition
there are a number of immediate new new modules that process information for example
if I see something there are different layers in my visual cortex that will first
recognize light and dark and then recognize edges and then they will recognize shapes and then
they will recognize objects it leads a particular conclusion in the example I gave the
of the hand on a hot stove
here probably it may not even reach the brain it may just go to the spinal cord but
the sensors and the signal that that eventually be pulled away my hands it just a forced process
so now of course processing that is what I call all circuiting active activation we have the
sensors here on the bottom left left the cell provide input input the effect effectors my muscles
are put on the system but before it reaches the effectors the activation circulates in
what called the global workspace which is some kind of a assume to be a network of
on-range connections in the cortex and then you have the diff modules which are specialized
circuits that for example recognize sounds or look openings or make equations or fractions
the most can be very diverse very specialist but these models now interact with what's going on
in the workspace that means that what happens in the workspace the activation that's circulating
can go to a to one of the modules which the module doesn't do anything with it
on the other hand it can go to a module reaction so it's an interaction action or there can be
a module that receives input from a different part of the brain and that some input in the
workspace so the workspace is seen as a kind of a form a kind of a public for all the specialized
brain circuits and in a kind of a discussion it's as if they are talking together in this
global workspace so here here there are some examples of the where they are doing experiments
with on-piece and you can give them here so-called sub-subliminals that means something that I think
that a visual stimulus and disappears so quickly that the monkey doesn't have talent
conscious of it of it and you see this kind of a field of field of activity that means that
for the input the the the neurons get directly activated and they pass home
they're output to a number of neurons but it moves basically in one direction
on the other hand if you leave the uh stimulus for a long enough time that the monkey becomes
cause of it now that's what they call reverberation what I call circulation now you see that the
the different created neurons they send the situation back and forth everything is keeping
itself self-indulgent that is a standard model of consciousness or what is called access
consciousness the consciousness in the sense that you have access to what's going on in your mind
you have the ability to examine to monitor to read whatever is going on in your mind
but now there is another aspect of consciousness that is subjective experience and associated with
this with this whole problem of consciousness what is a subjective experience it is feeling
that that is something that you are conscious and that subjective experience I personally
prefer the term subjective experience but some other terms you may have heard are qualia acquai
is an individual subjective experience it's also called phenomenal consciousness and a most common
phase defined what what a qual or a subjective subjective experience that what is it like like
to for example what what is it to see see her typical example loss of his health is subjective
experiences is something else there's an input but you have the subjective experience of her
as so the heart problem of consciousness is what precisely are these subjective experience
why do we have these subjective experiences and the famous uh thought experiment that kind of
behind the whole heart heart problem of conscious was uh discussed by the philosopher David David
charmer it's the zombie thought experiment so so what he does David David charmers he dreams
that there are certain speech he calls zombies that behave just like any normal being but they
don't have subjective experience so he imagines that the zombie would put his hands on a hot stove
the zombie would pull away his hands and ask the zombie what happens the zombie will tell
I felt hot pain but actually the zombie didn't feel any so the thought experiment is that the zombie
is like a normal normal human being but actually he doesn't doesn't have subjective experience
and then the heart problem is since by definition we cannot cannot see between a zombie and in a
human being we cannot do a scientific experiment that will explain what the human being has
subjective experience what the zombie likes yeah to me that is a meaningless thought
element because if there is really no way that that I can distinguish only from a human human being
all all of you can be this or none of you of you can be zombies any of you can be a zombie
to me that is not not a good way to good way to define it so let's explain something subjective
explain my point of view first question a question that philosophers to my surprise have a lot of
difficulties with why is experience subjective why I can't be just objectively see the way things
are so so for me it appears humans are all the way systems all the way systems as I said I said
in me cannot objectively believe the world they do have access to art in the in the world
only have access to her per terms their self-maintaining processes whatever interferes with
their metabolism if something interferes with my metabolism that means for example that it
leads to the releases of neurotransmitters if in particle cells then I can feel
that perturbation of my metabolism but I do not access to think itself though
the thing that follows so much from my theory of poyesis is that
autopoietic processes by definition they are not neutral they care about what happens to them
they distinguish between good things and bad things whatever helps them to maintain themselves
such as food they see as positive whatever interferes with the autopoietic such as a plate
that can burn them they will see as negative so from an autopoietic point of view all experiments
of course happen from an internal thousand perspective I can only perceive the world
from inside my own body inside my own brain and what I perceive as neutral is not objective
it is colored by my goals which is to stay alive and that is why for example have a different
perception between let's say a butterfly and a wasp I like the flies I don't like wasps I know
that wasps can be which will interfere with my autopoiesies so and while I might say you
should be more you should be objective objective but the wasps are just insects
but I'm likely to kill the the the wasp and not the butterfly
so now
so the subjective experience affects my autopoietic process so what does that mean
effect I'm using using effect now so in the psychological so an effect is something that
acts on all that means it pushes or pulls me towards it like for example it's if there is food
I will be attracted to the food on the other hand it will push me away away from things
are dangers from disturbances it will push me away from the hot plate or from the wasp
and that is a typical all-girl directed system there is a classic example of bacterial hemotaxis
bacteria can substance food molecules and toxic models and and they are to follow a
gradient towards the food or away from the toxins so that's what we
define elementary and the agency of the girl directed most of the bacteria are affected
by by what happened in my effect there but there is not that conscious effects
so now I finally come to my solution of the heart problem of business it's what I call
local field model I've also been the local cost-effect model so
equivalent to fall these things that push push or pull on the other hand kindness tells me that I
don't just just immediately react react take the time to come to consider different different
process that push and pull in different direction so there is a range of potential actions now a
range is something like a space if I put a force across a range I get what in uh
mathematics or in physics called a field I could have presented as a kind of a vector field across
across a phase of potentiality potentiality that means potential reactions I would have
but but since I do not do not know what one under all circumstances there is this cognitive
the field the field is low emanates from the here the here now and the farther away in space of time
the less my my idea will be what what the field is so how how can we even this local field in the
brain I go back to my to my picture of the work space there is a circling activation so in the
global space there is this phase activation but the activation to some degree it's a process
spreading activation in uh in psychology that are asserted are related to that are in the global
workspace will receive some leaking activation and that leaking activation in a sense pairs the way
for potentially the next action or the next total or the next invitation so the diffusing
activation diffusing from the global workspace that's a sense forms the local the local post
which to be is the subjective experience uh we'll skip that that one
so this local field it's a conceptual model the reason that nowadays I prefer to call it
local prospect is that that's the first time I started explaining it to people working consciousness
everybody I assumed that I was imagining some some kind of a quantum mechanical fields
relating from my my brain and the field is purely a mathematical concept or a conceptual
model it's not a physical physical field on the other hand on the other hand I'm using a field
because because field is something you can explain in mathematics so that means that
potentially I hope that they will eventually be able to make a mathematical model or computer model
of what the subjective experience would be so in consciousness we speak about about so called
neural correlates of consciousness but the subjective experience that you feel the neural
correlate the activity that is actually not noticeable the brain and this neural correlate
for not for me it's a term that I took from uh the neural uh uh not called Stephen Gross but
I call it an adaptive resonance resonance because it is kind of self-maintaining
circulation of activity adaptive because it also adapts to things to inputs and outputs so
there's activation that is kind of self-maintaining within work memory in the global workspace
that activation in and out of out of the resonance like that it move one direction
action or the other and initially the activation you can you can see the different
actions and then and then it assists it choose the action rather than the other potential it's a
little bit available to the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics if your field of
activation is diffusing can be seen as a wave then at a certain moment when you make a decision to
do this or that it's like like the wave is it but then immediately when it starts spreading again
so find free willful uh I see brain as as a elective specialized modules these
modules are so which we can see them as kind of agents within the society of mind these agents
interact they have a discussion the discussion takes place in these global workspaces and the
why is the will free because you can say beforehand what the art of discussion will be
it's as if you different different people with different unions and different different
backgrounds to think about whatever whatever political problem you do not know beforehand
what solution they will come out on art because they are they are confronted with perspectives
that have not been confronted before as each speaks in turn that means there is a very strong
effect of who speaks when timing standard etc you cannot predict what discussion will be
it it's a non-linear process that means that it's subject to what's called it's called the
butterfly effect meaning meaning that very differences in activation of timing can
lead to these outcomes in other words whole process isn't predictable why we call it for it
free it is not it's not deterministic so again the same picture the society of mind now
now we look at the modules as if they are agents each agent has certain opinions certain things
it's considered important certain things you know certain things it's good at and that's
agent is this thing it's some of its opinion in the workspace is where other agents can react
to it and their opinion opinion to it whole thing is is a very created in interaction
different agency agency so here I go back to the picture I took from Michael where he speaks
about compound intelligence is is cells together have a higher level of intelligent cognition
uh individual cells be because they interact act because they are in this kind kind of
discussion the same thing for for organisms like arms same for you or humans at each level
each level we can say cognition mission is beauty is collective if
so the the moments are different agents that become coupled that means that they are in some
relationship that's relatively stable I know that they will exchange information
because one will react what the other one does the output of the one becomes becomes the input of
the other and vice versa signals travel from from agent to agent and and that allows a more
this or collective intelligent my first example was a bacterial cell apopoietic network network
that consists of actions each of the actual the actual the molecules is you might say a very very
primitive that is interacting with all the others to gather they form apopoietic network
when I look at the human brain I the agents are different models that are help holding
their discussion in the global workspace and finally in society we might say different people
are discussing in in what we call the northern hemisphere the worldwide crop the gen genitals
fee in which communications are fine finally inclusion what I had to do is to do the kind of
one a natural history of agency starting from the very simplest agents which are the outcome
of reaction networks that self-organize these reaction networks tend to become a close and
self-containing meaning that they are autopoietic as simple apopoietic systems are they're going
for the innovations they to learn to adapt to adapt that mean they need to learn to learn to
condition action action rules you know in this in this condition I need to perform to perform
this actually survive fine and in human brains we have the additional stage of consciousness
that means that the condition action rules are no longer automatic condition or particularly
leading to action but we will get an intermediate stage of circulation where I activate thoughts
feelings are circulating in what's called the global journal workspace that circulation
defines a local possible prospect of potential developments out of these potential demands
eventually chosen and the one that is one that is chosen collectively collaboratively
by the different models are discussing so I think we still have time for a few questions
great thank you any questions
sure I'll ask a question this is Chris
thanks thanks for your talk you characterize the environment as a source of perturbations
and you also mentioned that autopoiesis is an attractor in the state space of a complex system
so do you consider the environment to be itself an autopoietic system
that's an interesting question this is part of a broader perspective which is relational
agency if you look at the system you can see the system as a whole as a robotic system in the
sense that there are flows of was it being consumed and consumed and produced so an ecosystem
as a whole would also be an autopoietic system in that sense okay great thank you
anyone else
hi I do I have a question could you elaborate a little bit about your response to the zombie
criticism are you are you thinking that a zombie autopoietic system cannot exist
what exactly are your thoughts there this curious
okay it's it's a kind of a metaphysical assumption which which life means the identity of the
indistinguishables so what's given by that is if you cannot distinguish two things if there is no
no you can say I have only here and I have a human here I can distinguish the one from the
other some way then the identity of the diseased zombies are humans so for me
stimulating a distinction lead to any other the other distinction is meaningless yes another way
to formulate it is it's called the difference that makes it if you start by postulating a
difference between zombies and humans then it should make some other difference just postulating
a difference that does not lead to any any difference to me is it's useful that it's
making things complicated that shouldn't be made complicated
so the the main question really for me is is why do we subject to the xpxp
why do we something for example for example if we learn and we feel because as the color
is a signal that has certain meaning for us that we have associated for example with warm
or with action and that makes us do certain things harder than others so the color that will
influence me in a different way than the color blue and that is what a subjective experience is
yeah I the way I always understood the zombie criticism was that subjective experiences
is not necessary to do the kind of things that like organisms as complex as humans can do
but we do have subjective experience which is is it may have been a product of evolution and maybe
it plays a a role
