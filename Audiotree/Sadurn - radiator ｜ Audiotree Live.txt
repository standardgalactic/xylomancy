Music
Hey, I know an hour ago I said I'd come and get you
Well, actually, you think I need this hour to myself
Laying on the radiator, but I know I'll see you later
Suddenly you're stepping on what I've been covering up
When I think about you, it is like a night for my girl
Baby, I should tell you why
When you called to tell me that you've had a terrible day
So I'll come and pick you up outside of the right hand
With the lamp light on your face
I know I like you exactly that way
But I know the birds are circling my heart
Maybe I'm frightened of what happens if I start saying what I have been thinking
I don't want to tell you what
Maybe nobody's certain about these things
So can I just believe in all the goodness that I've seen
Like how you spread your light around me
So can I just believe in all the goodness that I've seen
Thanks for watching!
