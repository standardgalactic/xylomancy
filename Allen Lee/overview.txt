1. **Durable Formats**: Data should be stored in formats that will remain accessible over time, such as plain text (e.g., CSV) rather than proprietary formats like Excel. This ensures long-term readability and usability of the data.

2. **Data Changelog**: Any manual data manipulation should be documented in a changelog that records changes made, their intent, and retains both the before and after states. Ideally, data processing should be scripted to allow for easier replication and analysis.

3. **Analysis-Friendly Data**:
   - **Variables**: Each column in your dataset should represent a variable, not multiple variables combined into one column. This simplifies programmatic analysis and avoids issues with unit conversions.
   - **Observations**: Each row should represent a single observation, with each column representing a different measurement or time point. This format is conducive to automated data analysis.

4. **Documenting Dependencies**: Ensure that all system and software dependencies are clearly documented. This can be facilitated by using tools like Docker, which encapsulates an application's environment and dependencies in a container.

5. **Reproducibility and Representation**: Create clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running computational models, including any necessary system or software configurations. This promotes reproducibility and makes it easier for others to use and build upon your work.

6. **Automation**: While automating everything is ideal, starting with explicit and well-documented processes is a good first step towards better management of computational models.

7. **Importance of Good Practices**: The practices of archiving computational models in reproducible and reusable ways are not just for the sake of technology but are essential for the advancement of disciplines that rely on computation as a virtual laboratory. It facilitates collaboration, verification, and validation of scientific findings.

In summary, the presentation emphasizes the importance of using durable data formats, documenting manual data changes, ensuring analysis-friendly data structures, clearly defining dependencies, and embracing automation to enhance reproducibility and reusability of computational models in scientific research.
