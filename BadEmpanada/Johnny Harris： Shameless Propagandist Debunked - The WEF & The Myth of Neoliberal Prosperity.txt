If you watch political or historical content on YouTube, you're probably aware of Johnny Harris.
He's hard to miss because YouTube's algorithm recommends his videos a lot.
Back in 2021, the YouTuber Tom Nicholas made a video about Harris getting sponsored by the
World Economic Forum to make a video promoting a book they wrote. Tom used that video, called
How China Became So Powerful, as an example of how money can be used to get seemingly independent
YouTubers to make paid propaganda. Harris then responded in the comment section. He admitted
that the video was made in partnership with the WEF, but said that he didn't see a problem with it.
Then in another comment, he bemoaned the fact that no one was taking the actual argument of
his video seriously. According to him, he'd done exhaustive research, sifting through lots of data
to make that video, and people were just using the fact that it was made on behalf of the WEF
as an excuse to avoid engaging with its actual content. Johnny should have been careful what he
wished for because it's come true. In this video, we're going to be refuting the actual content
of the video in question, which is not very good to say the least. If it was actually the result
of him spending loads of time researching, then his research skills should be seriously questioned.
This video was made possible thanks to my supporters on Patreon and Ko-fi.
This video is broadly indicative of Harris' content in general. He likes to act like he's
teaching you something new, profound, and different. Hidden knowledge that the powers that be have
kept on the down low. Things that go against the status quo and the taken for granted opinions that
most people hold. In reality, though, most of his videos are simplistic slump that serve precisely
to direct the audience towards conclusions that uphold the status quo, either through obfuscation,
or, as in the case of this video, by outright supporting it. They're usually just barrages
of rapid fire statements that Harris, and whoever works for him because he's definitely not making
these videos by himself, make little to no effort to actually explain, let alone back up with any
sources. Before you can think about what he's saying and the fact that he's not really given you
any reason to even believe it, he's already moved on to telling you what to think about
something else, while stock footage plays with inspiring music and camera roll sound effects
in the background. Here's an illustrative example from the video in question. This was China,
the Middle Kingdom, and right next door, India. This was the center of the global economic universe,
but around the 1800s, that started changing. Over here in Europe and the United States,
there was a major revolution that started taking place. Science, then machines, then weapons,
trains, cars, flight, bombs, factories, cities, and with their new power, these countries started
to expand to take over large swaths of the map. China remained a great civilization, but as the
West started showing up, knocking on China's door with their big guns, China couldn't really match
their firepower, and they had to concede land to Britain, which is how we got Hong Kong. The
Industrial Revolution didn't really happen in China the same way it did in the West, and by the
middle of the 1800s, China began a massive decline in its economic standing in the world. A century
later, that situation got way worse, as China was invaded by its neighbor, Japan. China's economy
was no longer the prosperous Middle Kingdom, but rather a shadow of itself, a poor country that was
being occupied by outsiders. Once World War II was over, the West devised a new global economic
and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the
West, capitalism, free enterprise. That's really the essence of Johnny Harris right there, a flurry
of no context statements thrown out with little explanation and backed up by nothing more than
stock footage and his word. In the course of about 90 seconds, he describes China as having been one
of the most powerful countries in the world. Then industrialization just like sort of magically
happening, which subsequently enabled the West to get stronger, expand, and attack China. Then
there's a 100 year time skip. It's now 1945, and oh, Japan is invading China now, yes? So China is
suddenly relatively weak now, and oh, there's capitalism too apparently. What a ride that was.
Harris has all of this completely backwards. He presents the industrial revolution like it's
what enabled the European colonialism that he refers to as expansion. Yet said colonialism
predated the industrial revolution, which began in the 18th century by hundreds of years. So it was
the colonialism that enabled the industrial revolution, not the other way around. The historian
Eric Williams showed via exhaustive archival research that the profits that funded much of
the first industrial revolution, and thus led to everything that came afterwards, came from
British slave colonies in the Caribbean. And that's just one small example of how the murder,
subjugation, and dispossession of much of the rest of the world is what the West economic power and
development of capitalism was built on. So it was colonialism elsewhere that gave the Western
countries the advantages that they needed to subsequently colonize China and eliminate it as
a competitor, rather than just some magical sudden explosion of technology and science that they then
took advantage of. I love how he actually verbatim just exclaims science. It's like a Tim and Eric
skit. So huge L to China for making the fatal mistake of not killing, robbing, and enslaving
people on the other side of the world to spur their own industrial revolution. The main narrative
throughout this video is that free market capitalism is amazing. So his reasons for skipping over what
actually happened so egregiously can be deduced pretty easily. It's a lot easier to make a video
celebrating capitalist free enterprise if you ignore the much less savoury reality of how it
came to be. And he especially needed to do this because the World Economic Forum probably wouldn't
be very happy about a video that presents the early development of capitalism and capitalism in
general for that matter in anything but a glowing light. The final bit of that clip and what comes
after it is particularly characteristic of the often chaotic poorly structured zero substance
nature of Johnny Harris's videos. The West devised a new global economic and financial system. It
was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the West. Capitalism, free
enterprise, still with some government oversight and high taxes for the rich and corporations,
but it was still capitalism. So there's a 100 year time skip to 1945 and capitalism
is only being introduced now, not with the industrial revolution of two centuries beforehand
which he covered about a minute earlier. He then tells us that before this, this capitalism was
working so well in the West. But this is contradicted by the very fact that what he's describing here
is the Bretton Woods economic system established by the USA and other Western countries at the
end of World War II. Though you might have missed that because he just glosses over all the details
entirely. He just flashes Bretton Woods on the screen and explains nothing about it beyond it
apparently involving more government oversight and higher taxes on the rich. The post-war Western
Economic Order which is known as the Bretton Woods system was a pretty substantial departure from
how things were before it and we'll be going into that in more depth later. The point here though is
if things were going so well beforehand as Harris claims,
It was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the West.
Then why would such substantial reforms have even been carried out? They wouldn't have been,
obviously. This was just six years after the end of the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis
in recorded history which was immediately followed by World War II, the worst war in recorded history.
So capitalism clearly wasn't actually working well at the time at all and that was precisely why
these reforms were instituted. Harris is honestly often kind of difficult to respond to because he
just makes statements like that which amounts a little more than things were good so everyone
agreed to do more good things. In reference to the fucking Great Depression, World War
fucking too and the sweeping economic reforms that were carried out afterwards in an attempt
to try and ensure that those things didn't happen again. It's genuinely childish. He presents
history as if it has no context, no continuity, no nothing. To refute him I had to go over the
basics of what actually happened from scratch because his video just doesn't actually explain
anything at all and it's not like he's just getting some minor details wrong either. He's
grossly mischaracterizing everything and leaving out so much crucial information that contradicts
him that any response to his claims takes 5,000 times more effort than he put in to make them in
the first place. Like he just blurts out that capitalism was working so well. That's a pretty
bold statement to make about the world in 1945 given everything that had just happened in the
decade or so prior. You'd think it at least expand on why he's saying that with some examples as to
why and maybe even, I don't know, provide some proof to back it up. But Johnny Harris is above
such pettiness. He just says stuff and then moves on. The audience is to just trust him.
His videos are just a barrage of statement after statement. 90% of them backed up by nothing more
than his undue confidence. Maybe 10% of them actually being followed up with any attempt to
explain the why and how of what he's saying and even fewer than that backed up by anything even
resembling a source. When he finally does get around to trying to present some evidence, it usually
doesn't even actually back up what he's saying and it sometimes even presents it as if it's some
sort of special event. It's snappily edited and the music ramps up as if to say, look guys,
I'm citing a source. I did it. You can trust me. He does exactly that in this video actually.
After 7 minutes of rapid fire statements with next to nothing presented to even try to back them up,
this happens. I have two graphs I want to show you.
They look like this. Wow. Great graphs you got there, dude. Excellent job. You finally presented a
source. It's really propaganda theater. It's made to look and sound like it's insightful,
informative, authoritative and thus correct. But it falls apart immediately if you watch it while
paying full attention and think about what's being said and what you're being shown. The video
that we're covering here is an amazing example of all of this. It is the Johnny Harris video
par excellence. I speak good French, but it's also a paid propaganda video designed to dishonestly
present the worst ideas from the world's most powerful and ghoulish capitalist and their corporations
hatch for the purposes of maintaining their own power and wealth as if they're actually beneficial
to the average person. Despite the title ostensibly being about China, it really has little to nothing
to do with it. China is just used as a framing device to celebrate free markets, neoliberal
capitalism and then suggest more neoliberal capitalism as the solution to problems caused
by neoliberal capitalism on behalf of the elites who have themselves benefited the most from
neoliberal capitalism. Johnny Harris's videos already tend to be pretty childish propaganda
and in this one where he's being paid by the world economic forum, he becomes a parody of himself.
Something that Tom Nicholas didn't quite cover in his video is that Johnny Harris completely
misrepresents the ideas that he's being paid to promote here, which are actually even worse than
what they already seem like on the surface. He lied in order to paint a scheme crafted by billionaires
to institute direct corporate rule over international governmental systems such as the UN as actually
just little more than corporations being a bit nicer to their workers. And I'm well aware of the
fact that that sounds like a conspiratorial exaggeration, but as I'm about to show you,
it's really not. We're going to continue on here from the second half of the video and then we're
going to go back and dissect the rest of the first half afterwards. This is because it's only at the
halfway point that he actually plays his hand and gets down to the real point of the video,
which is to be propaganda for the world economic forum. So dissecting this bit is the most important
thing to do here and it's also very important context for the first half of the video too,
because it's just so blatantly wrong about everything that it only really starts to make
sense once you realize that the reason that it's like that is because the creator was being paid
to lie. Part one, Johnny lies for the world economic forum. The world economic forum,
which Johnny Harris very dishonestly presents as just a think tank, and I was able to partner
with the world economic forum, which is a think tank that I respect, is the world's most powerful
advocacy group for corporations and the ultra rich. On the one hand, it uses resources from its
paid members, including pretty much every single one of the worst corporations that you can think of,
to lobby governments and international organizations such as the UN to adopt policies that benefit
them at the expense of everyone else. This is the part of the world economic forum, which is most
insidious, and it often goes under the radar. So how convenient it is that in this video by
coincidence we're going to be covering it. On the other hand, it and the events that it organizes,
such as its yearly summit at Davos in Switzerland, act as a public relations exercise for its donors
and members, as Tom Nicholas explained very well. Davos and the world economic forum then are
essentially where the richest 1% go to pretend to have a conscience. While I'm sure there's plenty
of backroom wheeling and dealing which is facilitated by the world economic forum, in terms of its
public facing activities, it serves as a means for global corporations and the super rich to
repeatedly pretend to have seen the error of their ways and to be on the cusp of change before they
go back to their boardrooms to carry on with business as usual. So Harris establishes the basis
for his talking points taken directly from decades of world economic forum propaganda by making a
couple of core claims. Firstly, he claims that the shift in economic policy in the west in the
70s and 80s towards neoliberalism made the west more prosperous. He makes this clear by continuously
praising probably the most famous neoliberal ideologue of all time, Milton Friedman, and implying
that the policies that he supported worked really well and that he had a point. Milton Friedman sort
of had a point and it led to huge prosperity in the west as the US economy exploded. All of this
is false and we're going to be refuting it in detail in part two of this video. Side note,
if you're confused by me talking about neoliberalism here, then don't worry because I'm going to be
explaining more about it as we get through the video and I also have a whole video that explains
it and its history in detail that you can check out. To be honest, you'd almost certainly learn
way more that's actually useful by watching that video over this one though it's also going to be
considerably less entertaining than watching Johnny Harris get embarrassed. Pick your poison.
The second core claim that Harris bases his conclusions on is the idea that the most important
defining part of the modern economic era, again beginning in the 70s and 80s, is that corporations
are now driven by a desire to make profits for their shareholders. So important and different,
this has supposedly been, that it even merits being delineated as a completely different form
of capitalism known as shareholder capitalism. The idea at the core of this financial and economic
system was that companies would get investment from people who own shares in that company,
we call this a corporation, and that the sole purpose of this corporation was to make money
for these owners or these shareholders. Now this simply isn't true. The defining thing
about this era was that neoliberalism inspired economic policies began to be implemented in
practice in the 1970s and spread all over the world in a couple of decades. Not that there was some
sort of massive paradigm shift where companies started seeking profit more than they had before.
A shareholder is after all just someone who owns a part of a company, which might vary from a
completely insignificant amount to a controlling stake. Corporations have obviously always been
driven by seeking as much profit for their owners as possible. You can go back 110, 120 years or so
to the era of standard oil for example, one of the most infamously horrible corporations in history
and see that things were much the same. Companies seeking shareholder profit, which according to
Harris is the most important defining part of the neoliberal era, is actually so unimportant to it
that Friedman, the theorist who he cites approvingly throughout the video, didn't even mention that in
his own definition of neoliberalism. He wrote, Neoliberalism would accept the 19th century
liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would substitute for the
19th century goal of laissez-faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive order.
It would seek to use competition among producers to protect consumers from exploitation, competition
among employers to protect workers and owners of property, and competition among consumers to
protect the enterprises themselves. The state would police the system, establish conditions
favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework, and relieve
acute misery and distress. The citizens would be protected against the state by the existence of
a private free market, and against one another by the preservation of competition. So the actual
crux of neoliberalism according to Friedman is that competition is everything, that the best
society is a dog-eat-dog capitalist one, where everyone and everything is in a competition with
one another at all times, with the spoils going to the winners and the losers getting as little as
possible. Friedman says that the government should try to foster such a society, and throws in some
platitudes about this all supposedly being to protect people, and a laughable bit about preventing
monopoly. There's nothing about shareholders there, and that's because shareholder capitalism is
just a buzzword that the World Economic Forum likes to use to divert attention away from neoliberal
economic policies and blame the problems that they have caused on a complete red herring.
Harris is just parroting them here, which is, you know, what you'd expect, given that they paid him
to make this video. A good basic summary of what neoliberalism is in practice comes from the economic
historian David Harvey. Neoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic
practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual
entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong
private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the state is to create and
preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. The state has to guarantee,
for example, the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those military,
defense, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property
rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore,
if markets do not exist in areas such as land, water, education, healthcare, social security,
or environmental pollution, then they must be created by state action if necessary. But beyond
these tasks, the state should not venture. State interventions in markets once created must be
kept to a bare minimum. There has everywhere been an emphatic turn towards neoliberalism
in political economic practices and thinking since the 1970s. Deregulation, privatization,
and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision have become all too common.
Almost all states, from those newly minted after the collapse of the Soviet Union to old-style
social democracies in welfare states such as New Zealand and Sweden, have embraced,
sometimes voluntarily and in other instances in response to coercive pressures, some version
of neoliberal theory and adjusted at least some policies and practices accordingly. That's all
exactly the sort of thinking and exactly the sort of economic policies that the World Economic
Forum advocates for and that its corporate members benefit from. So they pretty clearly
aren't actually against the fundamentals of the economics of this period. So what they instead do
is try and convince people that the economic problems of the last 40 to 50 years haven't
actually been caused by these policies or by flaws in capitalism itself, but rather just by
corporations making a mistake and seeking too much profit. Which apparently wasn't a problem
before this. Because if we believe this, then they can sell us the idea that the way to fix this
problem isn't actually by governments taking meaningful action to rein these corporations in
or any change at all to the economic system itself, but rather by just leaving it to corporations
to change how they govern themselves. Just trusting them to voluntarily stop being driven by profit
becomes socially responsible in other such buzzwords and fix it all themselves. Surely they're
being honest here, that'll definitely work. This is how the WEF tends to conduct a lot of its
public relations exercises. They acknowledge the issues caused by pro-corporate policies such as
massive inequality and climate change because it's kind of impossible for them to ignore them at this
point. But they frame these problems as being caused by things other than their actual causes.
Because if we accept their alternate explanation, they can then lead us to the conclusion that the
overall direction of economic policy should remain fundamentally the same as it has since the 70s
and 80s. Which is, you know, exactly what they want. It's simple diversion. So once Harris has
finally stopped lying to the viewer about the cause of those problems in the exact same way the
World Economic Forum does, he, shaka, proposes the exact solution they do. But of course,
he first takes a second to just offhandedly scoff at the idea that socialism might be an
alternative solution. In true Johnny Harris fashion, no reasoning or explanation for this is given.
So what's the solution? Is it socialism? No, it's not. It is simply a new version
of capitalism, a reframing of how we think about business and globalization.
No, he says of utmost confidence. The real solution is to move on to another form of capitalism
from this non-existent shareholder one. What we need to do is just change the way we think about
business and globalization. He's not actually calling for any action in that buzzword salad,
just a change in thinking, which is reflected in the solution that he's about to propose.
Doing the same stuff, but reframing it as somehow actually beneficial for workers.
The mythology of neoliberalism supposedly being good for normal people can no longer be upheld
since the last 50 years of its practice have shown us clearly that that's not true.
So it needs a rebranding, and here it is. The solution isn't to scrap capitalism altogether,
but instead to expand it. To not just focus on shareholders and delivering them short-term profits
as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but to also focus on other people who are affected by
the business. You can call these stakeholders. This is like the customers, and the suppliers,
and the employees, and the government, and the overall economy, and the planet, and of course,
shareholders. This is called stakeholder capitalism, and it's basically just an acknowledgement
that businesses that focus only on profits for shareholders don't end up benefiting everyone.
There are winners and losers. So the solution to the problems of corporations being motivated by
self-interest is for corporations to magically just no longer be motivated by self-interest,
and to start just miraculously renouncing the profit motive, getting themselves a conscience,
and voluntarily helping everyone out of the goodness of their hearts, which they don't have
because they're corporations. There's not any sort of actual call to action to make this happen.
No government intervention, no regulations, no nothing. It's just something that we need to
trust corporations to do themselves. Yeah. Obviously, this isn't going to happen. Corporations are not
just going to regulate themselves out of a sense of social obligation. They're not just going to
give up their wealth and power because they feel bad about having it. On the occasions that they do
actually concede things to other so-called stakeholders, it is overwhelmingly because
they're forced to do so by government action. And on the very rare occasions where it might
seem like they're taking such actions themselves, it's certainly not out of a sense of obligation
to other stakeholders. It's just because they've calculated that doing so won't damage or will
increase their profits in other ways. For example, by giving them good publicity, by increasing worker
productivity, or by keeping workers just happy enough that they're less likely to start advocating
for something that might end up costing the company more. A good example of this is Amazon
instituting a minimum wage of $15 an hour for American employees. It helps to make them look
like they care about their workers, while at the same time, they do everything possible to bust
their workers' efforts at unionization to prevent them from actually being able to exert collective
pressure on the company and advocate for their own interests on their own terms. It's not about
the company legitimately caring about its stakeholders or anything even remotely like that.
It's about unaccountable executives deciding to give them a little bit in the hopes that they
don't start demanding something more substantial that would lower their profits more. And Amazon,
completely coincidentally I'm sure, just so happens to be one of the World Economic Forum's
strategic partners. Tom Nicholas summed up the essence of all of this very well.
The World Economic Forum's decision to work with Johnny Harris to create a video about how
companies such as Apple and Walmart are currently enthusiastically moving away from shareholder
capitalism and towards this vague notion of stakeholder capitalism is just another in a
long line of examples of the forum attempting to convince us that, against all the evidence,
they are even remotely concerned about anything other than profit.
With everything that we've just been over in mind, I want to present you with a quote from this
book, Stakeholder Capitalism, which is the book that the World Economic Forum paid Johnny Harris
to make this video to promote. The head of the World Economic Forum just launched a book called
literally Stakeholder Capitalism. It's an in-depth look at not only the rise of Asia and China,
but also other major trends that help us understand the need to upgrade our capitalism.
Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, writes within it,
I therefore advocate for a third system, which can be defined as stakeholder capitalism.
It is capitalism in the traditional definition of the word. Individuals and private companies
make up the largest share of the economy. This is, I believe, a requirement for a sustainable
economic system. Private individuals and companies must be able to innovate and compete freely,
as it unleashes the creative energy and work ethic of most people in society. The economic
activities of such private actors must also be protected and guided to ensure the overall
direction of economic development is beneficial to society and no actor can free ride on the
efforts of others. This is the kind of capitalism we ought to endorse. Do you notice how that sounds
oddly similar to Milton Friedman's description of neoliberalism that we went over earlier?
That's because it is just the same thing. The whole notion of stakeholder capitalism,
as presented in this video by Johnny Harris, and as obsessed about by the World Economic Forum,
is just a rebranding of neoliberalism. Harris and the WEF erased the existence of neoliberalism
entirely, creating this phantom of shareholder capitalism to shoulder the blame for its problems
and act as a sort of non-existent scapegoat. In order to propose a solution that they frame as
literally an entirely different version of capitalism, which even the slightest scrutiny
reveals is still just neoliberalism, with some vague, PR speak buzzwords thrown in
to try and make it sound like it's somehow different. It's not. As political scientist
Kyle Bailey wrote, Now that the myth of free markets can no longer convincingly naturalize
the public role of states in imposing actually existing neoliberalism, the discourse of stakeholder
capitalism represents its continuation by other means. Despite pretensions to move beyond profit
maximization, corporations attempts to satisfy extra economic interests remain firmly grounded in
the same capitalist market imperatives that proponents of stakeholder capitalism now claim
to be addressing. Here's an even worse thing, though. Harris isn't even actually being honest
about what stakeholder capitalism, as promoted by the World Economic Forum in the book that
is trying to sell to his viewers here, actually is. His presentation are that he's already
incredibly misleading, dishonest, and really just full of lies. But he also left out the more
unsavory and much more serious parts about what this term means to the World Economic Forum.
You see, they don't just think that companies should take their stakeholders into account or
whatever. For them, this notion of stakeholderism extends to everything, including national and
international governance. They consider multinational corporations to be stakeholders
of the world itself, who should have much bigger and much more direct seats at the table when it
comes to political decision making. The BS about corporations saving the world out of the goodness
of their hearts by deciding to treat workers slightly better rather than seeking profits
is cover for their ultimate idea of giving corporations even more political power than
what they already have. This is articulated in the book itself. A company that has a multinational
scope of activities not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts
itself as a stakeholder together with governments and civil society of our global future.
So, according to the very book that Harris was paid to promote, multinational corporations need to
be stakeholders on the national and international stage. On the same level as national governments
and civil society organizations, the latter meaning things like NGOs, which are themselves
overwhelmingly founded and or funded by those same multinational corporations and so advocate for
their interests as well anyway. This is what the stakeholder capitalism buzzword is actually
about for them, giving corporations even more direct decision making power regarding the direction
of global politics on top of all of the incredibly pervasive and destructive ways in which they
already influence global politics. They hide this goal of wanting to make themselves even more
powerful stakeholders in international governance behind this notion that all they want to do is
make you a stakeholder of the company that you work for. The economist, Jens Martens,
summarized the WEF's overall agenda. The World Economic Forum postulates that a globalized world
is best managed by a coalition of multinational corporations, governments, including through
the UN system, and select civil society organizations. It argues that governments no longer are the
overwhelmingly dominant actors on the world stage and that the time has come for a new stakeholder
paradigm of international governance. The World Economic Forum vision includes a public private
UN in which certain specialized agencies would operate under joint state and non-state governance
systems such as with the Food and Agriculture Organization through a global food agriculture
and nutrition redesign initiative. This model also assumes that some issues would be taken off the
agenda of the UN system to be addressed by pluralateral, often multi-stakeholder,
coalitions of the willing and able. What the World Economic Forum is advocating for with this red
herring of stakeholder capitalism is not the solution to the problems of neoliberalism that
Harris presents it as, nor is it meant to be. It is rather the final form of neoliberalism.
The fundamental neoliberal notion of totaling complete competition is taken to the ultimate
extreme, corporations competing with governments for the power to govern in a much more direct way
than they have before. And it's even worse with a bit more added context. Klaus Schwab, founder and
chairman of the WEF, whose name is on the cover of the book, though you know it was almost certainly
ghostwritten, has said that he considers nation states to be obsolete and that they should be
replaced with a global issue alliance, which based on their other statements would probably be made
up of multinational corporations. In context with everything else, it really makes it seem like their
ultimate goal is not just the already incredibly worrying idea of taking substantial decision
making power away from states and handing it directly to multinational corporations, but rather
to get rid of governments entirely and create some sort of anarcho-capitalist cyberpunk dystopia
where corporations just plain control everything. Now I don't want to fear Monger too much about
the WEF's agenda here. While they have laid it all out pretty clearly and pretty explicitly,
that doesn't mean that they've gotten their way or that they will. There is no world economic forum
led, new world order government on the way or anything, which conspiracy theorists often claim.
Though given the kind of stuff that the world economic forum advocates for that we just went
over, I can really understand how such conspiracy theories come to be. The WEF is just an advocacy
group for corporations that asked the question of, how can corporations get even more power?
And they came to the quite rational conclusion from their perspective of, they should try to
seize more direct decision making power from governments themselves. This is completely
predictable and expected, which is precisely why corporate government dystopias were already
being presented in fiction long before the WEF proposed such ideas themselves. It's simply the
logic of capitalism being taken to its ultimate conclusion. But these goals also aren't zero
some. It's not either they established the literal anarcho-capitalist cyberpunk dystopia
or they're failed. They just want as much direct influence over decision making as they can get,
and they've actually already been making inroads on this for quite a while now. In the UN for
example, the influence of their rhetoric can clearly be seen. Buzzwords for pervasive corporate
involvement like multi-stakeholderism and public-private partnerships have become more and
more common in UN documents. And multinationals have an even more prominent and direct role in
the UN and other global initiatives than they've ever had before. In 2019, the World Economic
Forum even signed a strategic partnership agreement with the UN. This is extremely bad, not just
because more corporate power and influence is bad in general, but also because it's even more
undemocratic than things already were before. While average people may be able to exert at least a
tiny little bit of influence over their governments, through things like voting and protests for example,
they have nothing even resembling that minor little bit of influence when it comes to corporations.
So with every little bit of decision making ability that corporations wrestle away from states,
nationally or internationally, you and people like you lose more of whatever little decision
making power you've got left. It's being appropriated from you and being handed over to
capitalists and executives directly. In order to even think about fighting these sorts of initiatives,
we first need to actually know that they're going on. And now you do, despite the fact that
Johnny Harris kind of forgot to inform you of that in his video. Harris outright stated that he read
the book and thought that it was great. The book is really good. Yet he nonetheless decided to leave
out the whole corporations should be stakeholders in global governance and get their own seats at
the UN thing. He's even proudly gloated that he was personally involved in that year's WEF summit
at Davos. The Davos summit happened this week and I'm really glad that I was able to be a part of
it. So he's clearly familiar with the organization and he should be familiar with their broader
agendas too. They're outlined in the book that he supposedly read, the book that he promotes in
this video. His video is already garbage immoral propaganda but with this extra context it is
even worse. He lied knowingly in exchange for money. It's that simple and we haven't even
covered the rest of the video yet where he lies a whole lot more. Part two, the debunking.
Now with the most important part out of the way, it's time to go back to the first half of the
video and refute the historical narrative of neoliberalism bringing amazing prosperity and
the claims that Harris makes to craft it, which is the foundation that he uses to propose the
ideas that we just dissected. How the video has a title about China I just don't know. It's mentioned
in the intro, promptly forgotten about for a while and then glossed over for a minute or two later.
It's actually a video about how great free market capitalism supposedly is and China is just used as
a framing device for that to pull the viewer in to what is actually a paid propaganda video.
This part is going to be quite long and detailed partly because the effort that you have to put
in to debunk misinformation is incredibly high relative to the effort that it takes to make it
up and partly because that's just how my videos are. I like to be furrow. So let's recap and expand
upon what we went over at the beginning. The video starts off with this zero context presentation
of the industrial revolution as some sort of miracle that just magically popped up out of
nowhere. Inverting reality to make it sound like it was the industrial revolution that
birthed western colonialism rather than the other way around. And capitalism doesn't sound quite as
good if you actually include the fact that what Harris frames as the West's amazing success was
built on the subjugation of billions of people. It's important to emphasize that the development
of the industrial revolution was hardly some sort of miracle of free market capitalism as is often
taken for granted including by Harris here. It happened under the circumstances of pervasive
government protection of local industry combined with the aggressive destruction of competitors
abroad and the importation of resources and capital to be invested from the Americas. The best example
of this is the development of the British textiles industry. The first truly fully mechanized industry
in the world and the most emblematic development of the first industrial revolution. This industry
was not only supplied by slave farmed cotton from the Americas but was also fostered by the
government who put restrictive tariffs on textile imports from India which at the time had the most
important textile export sector in the world. This encouraged investment in the local textile
industry to replace these imports. This is commonly known as import substitution industrialization.
All of this happened while the British were also simultaneously colonizing India and directly
destroying the Indian textile industry. The result was that the British textile industry became the
world's most important even exporting its products to India itself. So the industrial revolution was
built off the back of colonialism and spurred by very anti-free market government interference
contrary to pretty much everything about Harris's narrative throughout this video.
Most developed countries today in fact industrialize with these sorts of policies
protectionism import substitution etc and they only started with this rhetoric of free international
trade once their own industry was developed enough as a result to out-compete that of other countries.
So anyway moving on as we went over earlier Harris then finally introduces capitalism in 1945
about 200 or 300 years depending on who you ask after the time that it actually developed
conveniently skipping over all of the absolutely horrible things about it during that period.
He then moves on to inverting reality again claiming that capitalism was working so well
while simultaneously introducing the post-world war two Bretton Woods Accords. Bretton Woods
was an agreement between mostly western states that govern the rules of international trade between
them for about 30 years afterwards. This was specifically implemented because capitalism
actually wasn't working very well and had just been through its worst ever crisis the great
depression and you know the whole world war two thing too. The Bretton Woods era was characterized
by fixed currency exchange rates for international trade which were backed by the gold standard
tightened government regulations on business strong welfare states and so-called mixed economies
involving both private and public sector ownership. Academically this is often known as the period
of embedded liberalism. The embedded part comes from the work of the economic theorist Karl Polanyi
who used the word to emphasize the controls put on markets by outside factors such as the government
as opposed to disembed which describes a more free market that is not subject to such controls.
David Harvey summarized the causes and characteristics of the period of embedded
liberalism in the West. The restructuring of state forms and of international relations after
the Second World War was designed to prevent a return to the catastrophic conditions that had
so threatened the capitalist order in the great slump of the 1930s. It was also supposed to prevent
the reemergence of interstate geopolitical rivalries that had led to the war. To ensure domestic peace
and tranquility some sort of class compromise between capital and labor had to be constructed.
The thinking at the time is perhaps best represented by an influential text by two
eminent social scientists Robert Dahl and Charles Limblum published in 1953. Both capitalism and
communism in their raw forms had failed they argued. The only way ahead was to construct the
right blend of state market and democratic institutions to guarantee peace inclusion well
being and stability. And so a variety of social democratic, Christian democratic and Dirijesta
states emerged in Europe after the Second World War. The U.S. itself turned towards a liberal
democratic state form and Japan under the close supervision of the U.S. built a nominally democratic
but in practice highly bureaucratic state apparatus empowered to oversee the reconstruction of that
country. What all of these various state forms had in common was an acceptance that the state
should focus on full employment, economic growth and the welfare of its citizens and that state
power should be freely deployed alongside or if necessary intervening in or even substituting
for market processes to achieve these ends. Disqual and monetary policies usually dubbed
Keynesian were widely deployed to dampen business cycles and to ensure reasonably full employment.
A class compromise between capital and labor was generally advocated as a key guarantor of
domestic peace and tranquility. States actively intervened in industrial policy and moved to
set standards for the social wage by constructing a variety of welfare systems, healthcare,
education and the like. This form of political economic organization is now usually referred to
as embedded liberalism to signal how market processes and entrepreneurial and corporate
activities were surrounded by a web of social and political constraints and a regulatory environment
that sometimes restrained but in other instances led the way in economic and industrial strategy.
State led planning and in some instances state ownership of key sectors, coal, steel, automobiles
were not uncommon for example in Britain, France and Italy. The neoliberal project is to disembed
capital from these constraints. So yeah, not exactly the sort of thing that Harris is advocating for
in this video. Harris glosses over the amount of government intervention that actually characterized
this era acknowledging only that it involved government oversight and higher taxes and regulation
but nonetheless framing it as largely the same as before. A continuation of something that was
working so well which is a very audacious thing to say about the period immediately following
the Great Depression and World War II. He then credits a vague notion of capitalism with rebuilding
Europe after the war as if it was just the wonders of the free market that did it or something.
Seriously, he talks about this in the same way that a missionary would tell you about
the miracles of Jesus Christ. Capitalism, free enterprise, still with some government oversight
and high taxes for the rich and corporations but it was still capitalism and after the war
this capitalism would go on to become a miracle for many countries. Rebuilding Germany, France,
Japan, for many in the west post-World War II capitalism was like a magic elixir that was fixing
everything. He verbatim calls it a magic elixir that was fixing everything. At least try to be
subtle, come on. His core claim in that segment is that capitalism caused a miracle that rebuilt
Europe after World War II implying that what happened was some sort of miracle of the free market.
That couldn't be further from the truth. What happened after the war is that much of Europe
was destroyed while the USA, due to its geographic position, came out not just unscathed but with
a booming economy. So Western European countries along with others such as Japan and South Korea
were absolutely desperate to rebuild and the USA was the only game in town since they obviously
wouldn't have let them seek help from the USSR even if they wanted to. The US used this monopoly
to create the Marshall Plan and other adjacent initiatives which gave aid to those countries.
The catch was that this money could only be used to buy resources such as food and building materials
from sources that the USA had chosen which usually meant from the USA itself. This not only meant that
the money from the aid was just flowing right back to the USA anyway but it also allowed its
exports to penetrate into Europe in a much more long-lasting fashion. All of this was imposed
by the USA on countries that were in no position to refuse. So it was an initiative conceived by
the US government directed by them every step of the way to give their country a functional monopoly
over post-war trade and ensure their influence over the aid recipients. That is how these countries
were actually rebuilt after World War II not by the wonders of free market forces but by pervasive
and often coercive state action. But Johnny Harris frames it as some sort of magical free market
explosion where the magic words of capitalism and free market just caused miracles to happen.
But again the reason that Harris can't be honest about this and just glosses over it so childishly
is because the thesis of this part of the video is just that free market capitalism is super awesome
because that's what the World Economic Forum mandated conclusion needs it to be. So if he
acknowledged the fact that the post-World War II rebuilding of Europe was carried out under just
about the fervorce thing from the principles of free market capitalism imaginable, his entire
narrative would crumble. Harris then makes this statement. It was working so well that
more and more people started to believe that we needed to get government out of capitalism
and let the market just do its thing. This is another claim that's just contradicted by his
own narrative. Everything was just working so well after the war with embedded liberalism
that this drove people to want to change things by completely abandoning everything that had
characterized that system and all of its magical miracles where only two minutes in and Harris
has said something stupid, nonsensical, or contradicted himself just about every other
sentence. Anyway, so this just isn't true. Normal people once suddenly like, ah man this sucks.
I hate being guaranteed a decent wage. I hate having public health care and social welfare.
I hate that corporations can't just do whatever they want and that I actually have some bargaining
power so they have to at least give people like me some concessions. You know what I want? I want
all of that gone. Now the people that were advocating for this were businessmen, executives,
and their paid propagandists. Johnny Harris' forebears like Milton Friedman, the one singular
person who he actually presents as evidence for his idea of people wanting to just let the market
do its thing. One of the major advocates for this idea of unfettered capitalism was this guy.
He's never in history been a more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free
enterprise system in the free market. A Chicago-based economist named Milton Friedman.
If they fail, they bear the cost. If they succeed, they get the benefit.
This turn towards letting the market do its thing, as Harris describes it, began in the early 1970s.
It's called, as we went over earlier, neoliberalism, not shareholder capitalism,
and its conception actually long predates the time frame that Harris seems to ascribe to it.
Its public advocates, who had been paid to push it from the mid 1940s onwards by the ultra-rich
via think tanks such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the Institute of Economic Affairs,
had long been lobbying for a turn to neoliberalism. This advocacy was, from the very beginning,
in opposition to embedded liberalism and bread and woods, because capitalists considered this
system to be too restrictive on their interests. Not, as Harris claims, the post-war period being
super awesome, causing people in general to, for some reason, just incomprehensibly decide
to get rid of everything that had characterized it and replace it with something else.
The actual reasons behind this turn to neoliberalism are a lot less savory than that.
Embedded liberalism began to run into problems in the early 1970s and the 1973 oil crisis was
the definitive nail in its coffin. Numerous prominent scholars on the subject, like David Harvey,
Gerard Domeniel, and Dominique Levy, have concluded that the upper classes took advantage of this
chaotic situation to push for the replacement of embedded liberalism with neoliberalism.
Up until this point, neoliberalism had been little more than a fringe economic theory pushed by
their think tanks and a couple of board and paid for university economics departments,
like Friedman's University of Chicago. But now they had a chance to make it reality,
to rapidly put it into practice. The post-war system had greatly reduced their economic power
from its pre-war levels and they wanted it back. Neoliberalism in practice was first
implemented via imperialism. The USA backed a bloody military coup in Chile, where an elected
socialist government was overthrown via military coup and replaced with a neoliberal military
dictatorship. Economists, trained at the aforementioned corporate-funded Chicago School of Economics,
by the same Milton Friedman who Johnny Harris uncritically presents as some sort of genius,
were shipped in from the US to dictate the direction of social and economic policy. They
took on massive foreign debt via loans from the International Monetary Fund, opened up natural
resources to unregulated corporate exploitation, privatized swaths of public assets, abolished
or privatized public services and social welfare, and opened up the economy to the free market
exploitation of foreign companies. Chile, along with other violently imposed, US-backed neoliberal
experiments of the early to mid-70s, was used as something of a lab to see whether neoliberalism
would really work in practice in the way that the rich had hoped it would. Economic inequality
skyrocketed practically immediately. Wealth was redistributed very effectively from Chile's
working class to the richest segments of society, as well as to the rich of other countries.
So the experiment proved a resounding success at its aim of redistributing wealth and power back
to the rich, which inspired implementations of the same in the West itself. Margaret Thatcher
subsequently took power in 1979 in the UK on a neoliberal platform, while Ronald Reagan became
president of the US in 1981. Reagan's economic policy was written for him directly by the Heritage
Foundation, a corporate-funded think tank founded by conservative businessman to promote neoliberalism
in the wake of the collapse of the bread and wood system. Like literally, they found that a year or
two later, they clearly saw the blood in the water and were ready to pounce. The results from Chile
were then reproduced in those countries. The share of national income of the top 0.1% of the
population in the US and the UK had been falling throughout the entire post-war period and reached
its lowest level in history around 1978, right before the Thatcher and Reagan era began. In the
following two decades, as neoliberal policies were implemented, the trend shifted. Their income share
in the UK rose from 1% to 3.5% by 1998 and 2% to 6% in the US. In the latter case, this rival,
the levels of wealth and power held by the ultra-rich during parts of the Great Depression.
This was concurrent with a massive fall in real wages, meaning average worker wages adjusted for
inflation for the purposes of being able to compare wages at different times. Real wages in the US
had grown substantially all throughout the bread and woods period, then fell slightly due to the
oil crisis in the mid-1970s, before stabilizing and rising again. They then completely dropped off
a cliff once Reagan introduced neoliberalism in the 1980s and by the year 2000 had only just
managed to recover to 1966 levels. Even today, real wages in the US are stagnant and are still
only around the same level they were in the late 60s. This all happened while GDP growth and increases
in productivity levels remain the same as before. Throughout the bread and woods period, wages increased
as the economy grew, while in the neoliberal period, wages started decreasing, becoming decoupled
from economic growth. This means that what neoliberalism actually achieved wasn't the prosperity
that Harris nauseatingly repeats it did throughout the video, but rather it ensured little more than
that huge shares of income that previously were going to workers would go to the rich instead.
I'm getting ahead of myself a bit here, because what I just said actually also contradicts
large parts of Harris' narrative that we haven't even gotten around to yet, including the very next
sentence that he utters. Now, let's contrast the reality of the neoliberal turn that I just went
over with Harris' own explanation for it. More and more people started to believe that we needed
to get government out of capitalism and let the market just do its thing. Now yes, I know that's
just a short summary, and that's not the problem here. The problem is that it's just completely
wrong, and that even for a short summary, it simplified down to a kindergarten propaganda level.
Capitalism was awesome and magic, so people decided that they wanted the government out of
capitalism, and that's how we got neoliberalism. I genuinely am kind of worried that there seems
to be many grown adults out there who this sort of thing works on. Harris then does the whole
world economic forum thing of obscuring neoliberalism by claiming that it's actually shareholder
capitalism, you know, the stuff that we just went over. Since we've already gone over that,
I'm gonna skip ahead about 30 seconds to where he argues that Milton Friedman was right,
because neoliberalism, according to him, actually did work really well. And his proof for this is
a graph of raw GDP per capita in the USA. And if you look at the data in the United States in the
West, Milton Friedman sort of had a point. Now, first off, I already kind of refuted the argument
that he's making here by showing that after neoliberal reforms in the US, GDP and productivity
continued to rise at the same rates as before, but real wages dropped. But even if GDP per capita
had actually been growing at a higher rate than before during the neoliberal period, as he claims,
the massive drop in real wages would indicate that this increased growth was just going straight
into the pockets of the ultra rich, while normal people were just getting poorer and poorer every
year. This is demonstrative of how GDP and GDP per capita are usually not at all useful measures
of anything actually indicative of living standards on their own. But even if we do ignore all of the
more relevant metrics aside from GDP per capita that show that neoliberalism hasn't actually been
good at all for anyone but the rich, even by Harris's own measure, he's wrong. Since 1870,
real GDP per capita in the USA has grown at a steady rate overall, so much so that its trend
can be charted by a straight line. The growth rate had already recovered to the average rate
throughout US history of around 2% per year. So neoliberalism didn't actually even make the
US economy grow any faster. The growth of the neoliberal period is rather exactly on trend
with the average rate of growth throughout US history. All up, the growth of the period of
embedded liberalism from 1950 to 1980, where GDP per capita nearly doubled, was actually higher
than the growth from the 30-year period after Reagan brought neoliberalism to the US from 1981
to 2011, where it only increased by 65%. By starting his graph in 1960 and using simple
raw GDP per capita figures, Harris obfuscates this. Though this was probably unintentional and just
the result of him not being good at research, because the first result on Google for USA GDP per
capita is a graph from the World Bank, which his animation lines up with exactly. The reason why
his graph has that rather flat curve during the Bretton Woods era that makes it look like
neoliberalism increased GDP per capita at a higher relative rate afterwards is because this graph is
of GDP per capita in current US dollars, meaning not adjusted for inflation. So the seemingly
flat line growth in the 1960s in Harris's graph is an illusion. Inflation was low and stable,
and then it skyrocketed in the 70s and 80s. Even though this money was worth significantly less
relatively, as prices had greatly increased, the raw GDP per capita number nonetheless still went
up as a result. On Harris's GDP per capita graph, this makes it look like economic growth had shot
up from a rather stagnant curve into a straight line, when in reality it was a straight line the
whole time. Constant US dollar graphs, like the one that I cited, are adjusted for inflation,
and the World Bank website, which is where Harris pulled his graph from, also has their own constant
US dollar graph. It's just not the first result on Google. As you can see, it tells quite a
different story from the one that he used. So, this is the first actual source that Harris tries
to present in this video. Three minutes in, after having already made a ton of claims that were
just screaming out to be sourced. It is the first result from Google, and it doesn't actually prove
what Harris claims it does. The opposite is actually true, because inflation-adjusted versions of this
graph disprove his claim that Milton Friedman was right, as GDP per capita did not actually grow
any faster after neoliberal reforms. On top of that, GDP per capita used as the only metric here
to argue that neoliberal policies were making things better would hardly be enough to prove
his claim anyway, even if the data was actually on his side, since that says absolutely nothing
about how that income is actually distributed. As you can see, on the odd occasion where Harris
does bother to try and source a claim, it can go pretty catastrophically. Harris continues on from here.
And it led to huge prosperity in the West, as the US economy exploded.
No, the US economy did not explode, and it did not lead to huge prosperity. The economy grew
at the average historical rate, yet the average person started receiving less of that growth,
proven by real wages falling dramatically, while bottom 50% income share also took a huge nosedive.
In my book, personally, that's the exact opposite of huge prosperity. Luckily for him, though,
Johnny Harris is not beholden to things like actually presenting evidence for his claims,
so he can just say whatever he wants and then move on, treating it as if it's true just because
he said it, which is exactly what he does throughout the entire video and throughout pretty much all
of his videos. Wait a minute, but what about China? Are we talking about China and its economy,
you know, the Middle Kingdom, China? So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this
corporate free market capitalism that was taking over the world. Okay, so we're finally back to
China, and he prefaces this segment by again confidently stating that the West was thriving
thanks to corporate free market capitalism. It's like he's trying to wheel his version of history
into existence by just repeating it over and over. We've already established that this just
isn't true. What's interesting about those statements to me is the taking over the world
part because neoliberalism was bad for workers in the West, but it was even worse for people
elsewhere in the world. By focusing so much on the West, Harris misses the forest for the trees.
While neoliberals came to power via elections in much of the Western world,
neoliberalism was imposed by usually US-backed dictatorships in other places. As David Harvey
wrote, How was neoliberalization accomplished and by whom? The answer in countries such as Chile
and Argentina in the 1970s was as simple as it was swift, brutal, and sure. A military coup
backed by the traditional upper classes as well as by the US government, followed by the fierce
repression of all solidarities created within the labor and urban social movements which had
so threatened their power. So the neoliberal turn for the rest of the world went even worse,
while the Americans, Brits, French, Australians, etc. were merely misled into voting for neoliberalism.
For many others outside of the West and outside of the global North, the turn was much more violent,
being instituted by usually US-backed dictatorships or through coercive loans from international
institutions, aka front organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, with conditions that
forced the recipients to adopt neoliberal reforms. Many of the countries who received these loans,
such as Mozambique, had only recently gained independence from colonial rule and were in
a similar situation to what Europe was in after World War II, in desperate needs of funds to
rebuild. So they simply had no other choice. The same policies were implemented in these countries
as in Chile, the US, and the UK with similar effects. Increases in the income share of the rich
and decreases in the income share of everyone else. But in that case, neoliberalism fostered
not just the redistribution of wealth from workers to local rich people, but also from workers to
capitalists in the West, and particularly the US. Now, let's finally see what Harris has to say about
China. So while the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate free market
capitalism that was taking over the world, China was descending further and further into decline.
Instead of joining the capitalism party that the West was spreading throughout the world,
China resisted, turning to a one-party rule communist system headed by this guy, Mao Zedong,
who destroyed any chance of China's economy ever joining the prosperity happening around the world.
By the 1970s, China was a place of widespread poverty. The once prosperous kingdom had reached
rock bottom. This part is really something. So the West was apparently prospering due to
corporate free market capitalism, right? And it was spreading this around the world,
just kind of out of the goodness of its heart. They just wanted everyone else to enjoy free
market capitalism too. But unfortunately, China was ruled by Mao and the communists,
who were just too stupid and evil to press the big red button marked prosperity and join this
capitalism party. Instead of joining this feisty fiesta, they decided to instead press the poverty
button, and then they hit rock bottom as a result. This is the most generic, propagandistic rhetoric
imaginable. It's precisely how American propaganda has always framed its enemies. Their actions simply
can't be explained in any way, but by them being innately evil. Because who in their right mind
would oppose the freedom and prosperity that we so generously want to bring them? The entire
recent history of China, like, you know, colonialism and war, which had left the country in destitute
poverty long before the communists had ever taken power, is glossed over in order to make it seem
like there was no possible rational explanation for why China might have been a bit skeptical of
the western capitalism. Rather, China just had two buttons. One that said good things and one that
said bad things. And they pressed the ladder because Mao is evil and hates prosperity. A vague,
undefined, positive sounding term that Harris repeats throughout the video to signal to the
audience when they're supposed to like or dislike something. The implication of this is that any
country that's poor is poor simply because its leaders want it to be. For Johnny Harris, things
need to be this simple, because his video is a propaganda piece made on behalf of the world's
worst billionaires. It's best for him to be uncritical and unthinking and just try to win the
viewer over with sophistry, because basic things like evidence and rudimentary logic aren't on
his side. There's three other things that I want to address about this part. One, Mao was in power
from 1949 to 1976, entirely during the embedded liberalism period, which as we've already gone
over, was not characterized by corporate free market capitalism. So if there was prosperity in
the west during this time, it was due to something quite different than that. Harris once again screws
up his chronology for like the 20th time in this video. Two, Harris refers to the Cold War period,
in which the west was aggressively spreading capitalism throughout the world as the capitalism
party, as if this was something altruistic, and as if every other country was free to just copy
what they were doing, and was positioned to be able to do so. This was anything but the case. The
vast majority of countries at this time had no industrial base whatsoever, from which to build
such a system off, let alone one nearly as advanced as it was in most western countries. Many of them
were also still colonies, or recently liberated former colonies. Most were also overwhelmingly
agrarian, with populations made up mostly of peasants, and economies based around primary
products, like raw resources or agricultural goods. In short, they were really in no position to just
copy what the richest countries were doing at the time, one to one. They needed to industrialize from
scratch, but the west wouldn't let them. The US in particular, very aggressively prevented other
countries from replicating anything resembling the policies that characterized the embedded
liberalism era, like the regulation of markets, controls on capital flows, and forcing companies
to compromise with workers. Those sorts of policies were reserved for themselves and their allies only,
when other poor countries tried to industrialize in much the same ways that they had, tried to
regulate the ability of foreign countries to extract their resources, or did pretty much
anything aimed at curbing the power of corporations to better conditions for normal people, the USA
and their allies would step in to try and stop or at least impede their progress. Guatemala,
Indonesia, and Iran are just free examples, out of the many countries they targeted that were
trying to pursue regulated capitalist paths to development, because that was inconvenient for
the profit of the west. So they intervened to ensure that they were violently stopped from
doing so, with at least hundreds of thousands of people being killed as a result. So there was no
capitalism party that was just open to be joined. Harris's characterization of events is not just
simplified, it is outright wrong and intentionally misleading propaganda, at least I hope it is
because I really hope that he's not this dumb. He needs to have a simplistic villain who solely
threw their own personal, irrational evil, prevented China from joining the good guys and doing
capitalism to become prosperous, because the reality casts this supposed party of free market
capitalism in a much less flattering light. Free. The Maoist period in China was definitely
not rock bottom. Living standards actually improved greatly during it, and the overall economy expanded
at a decent, steady rate, even despite major catastrophes like the Great Leap Forward. GDP
per capita grew by about 2% per year, which is not incredible or anything, but still better than
before, and around the same as the average growth rate of the US economy throughout its history.
This economic growth data also has to be considered with the caveat that the Chinese economy at the
time was run fundamentally differently. Its income was allocated more equally, and it had
provisions for basic needs that GDP, designed to measure economic activity in a market economy,
can fail to account for. GDP is already a highly imperfect way of measuring production even in
a capitalist country. In a socialist and largely agrarian, non-market one, it's even less useful.
More direct indicators of living standards are much more useful. By 1978, peasants were earning
more than double the raw income they had earned in 1954, a trend confirmed by its replication
across multiple different data sets and metrics. Raw income among the urban population doubled as
well. This is also corroborated by the doubling of real expenditure per individual, meaning how
much money the average individual person was spending per year adjusted for inflation. The
purchasing power of the average person doubling in less than 30 years is at least a half decent
increase in prosperity, in my opinion. Daily caloric intake increased. Life expectancy shot
up very rapidly, rising from 40 in 1953 to 65 in 1978. Infant mortality dropped from 175 deaths
per 1,000 births to 37 per 1,000. Access to education was greatly expanded, with primary school
enrollment rates increasing from 48% in 1952 to 94% in 1978. Literacy rates also correspondingly
increased rapidly. So, contrary to Harris' fairytale narrative of there just being a big,
bad man who hated good things for no apparent reason, the Communist Party at the time both
wanted to make China more prosperous and did so. Assuming here that prosperity means living standards
improving, Harris never actually tells us what he means by that word, so I'm kind of guessing.
And it certainly wasn't anywhere near rock bottom, especially not compared to the previous
100 years or so, which were full of war and colonization, much of it at the hands of these
same Western capitalist countries that Harris spends most of his video praising.
I also want to note that the photos that Harris uses here are not actually of the 1970s as he
claims, but rather from the 1900s to the 1940s. They're squarely from the period of nationalist,
aka Western-aligned, rule. It seems like he went looking for photos of poverty from the 1970s to
back up his argument, but wasn't able to find them, so decided to instead present photos from
before the Communist ever came to power as evidence of them being bad. Kind of slimy, dude.
Next, Harris moves on to China's market reforms in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping,
because the entire point of him even talking about the Mao era was just to make it sound as
horrible and illogical and evil as possible, to then frame everything that followed it as even
more amazing in comparison. The worse that he can make the former sound, the better the latter
sounds in contrast, helping with the overarching, childish, uncritical celebration of free market
capitalism as some sort of magic narrative of the video.
The once prosperous kingdom had reached rock bottom, but that was all about to change.
So it's the 1970s and this is China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping. He came into power
hoping to turn around this 150 years of humiliation in China, the decline of China as a superpower.
Elsewhere in the region, China's neighbors had economies that joined the global economic
party that was happening in capitalism and they were thriving. They saw immense economic
miracles and pulled millions out of poverty. Really, all he does is just make statements
and then use positive sounding adjectives to tell the audience what they're supposed to think and
feel. Thriving economic miracles. The reality of what happened in these countries is nowhere near
as simplistic as Harris needed to be for his propaganda to work. Singapore and Hong Kong,
for example, are tiny city-states. Used as hubs for global finance and trade due to their unique
status as separate jurisdictions from much larger neighboring countries. And they only even came
to have this status in the first place due to unique historical circumstances related to colonialism.
That's not something that can at all be replicated in the vast majority of countries,
let alone a massive one like China. And whether replicating it would even be desirable at all
is also very questionable. Given that Hong Kong, despite its very high levels of gross wealth,
has one of the worst poverty rates in the entire global north and hundreds of thousands of people
who live in what are basically cages because they can't afford anything else. Singapore is also
hardly a model of the corporate free market capitalism that Harris is trying to promote.
Singapore is widely considered in the academic literature to have developed via state capitalism.
A highly government directed form of capitalism with considerable state control and ownership
of important sectors of the economy. They directed economic policy and leveraged state power at every
step of the way, which resulted in the government being the most important economic actor in the
country by far. This has resulted in an economy where, quoting a paper on the matter, the shareholder
centric corporation virtually does not exist. And where the state owns 37% of the stock market
capitalization, 95% of the land, 80% of the housing, et cetera. Quite contrary to Harris's
notion of shareholder capitalism having created prosperity. Of the other countries that Harris
points to, the three most worth looking at are Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Due to the context
of the Cold War and the end of World War II, the USA attempted to bring all of these countries
under its hegemony by providing them with considerable economic aid like it had with a
Marshall plan in Western Europe. Because of this, they were able to pursue levels of state
economic intervention and planning that weren't nearly as tolerated in countries not aligned
with the West. And this state direction was pervasive, especially in Taiwan and South Korea,
which were ruled by outright military dictatorships all the way up until the late 80s and early 90s.
South Korea had straight up, actual five year plans inspired by the USSR all the way up until
the 1990s. Painting their economic growth as due to the simple wonders of free market capitalism
is very misleading. Economist Ha Jun Chang commented on the common misconception that
these countries followed mainstream free market style policies. Many of the things that the East
Asian government officials did in the miracle years, protecting infant industries, forcefully
mobilizing resources away from technologically stagnant agriculture into the dynamic industrial
sector and exploiting the linkages across different sectors, contradict the free market view.
Had the East Asian countries, and indeed most of the rich countries in Europe and North America
before them, run their economies according to the principles of free market economics,
they would not have developed their economies in the way they have.
All of this is especially true of the period that Harris is covering here. These countries did
eventually adopt neoliberal dogma in the 80s and 90s, dialing back the state intervention that had
characterized their economies throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s. But the Chinese government's
market reforms happened in the 1970s, so clearly they were not inspired by what he calls corporate
free market capitalism in East Asia because it didn't exist there yet. I've said this already,
but it's worth repeating. Harris's content, and indeed a lot of other content on YouTube,
relies a whole lot on just confidently stating things that aren't true as if they are, without
even trying to actually substantiate these claims either, then acting like the point has been proven
regardless, and moving on to making another fundamentally incorrect statement that also
rests on the previous one, and all of the others before that having been true. So his whole narrative
here of free market capitalist prosperity has been crafted on a very, very long chain of falsehoods.
Deng specifically went on a visit to Singapore early on in his term, where ethnic Chinese had
adopted the free market, and they were thriving. He felt inspired. The Maoist economic doctrine
that had failed was over, and it was time to see if China could rebuild its economy,
experimenting with some version of capitalism. People didn't adopt the free market. That's not
how this works. You can't just individually decide that you want to do free market capitalism. No more
than I can just individually decide that I want to do communism. These are overarching socioeconomic
systems, not individual choices. These people lived under capitalism not because they had adopted it,
but rather just because they happened to live in a capitalist society. But yeah, we've already been
over what Singapore actually is and was, which conflicts greatly with Harris's narrative here.
What do you think it was that Chinese government officials may have seen when they visited
Singapore? That Chinese people are capable of running businesses like they have some sort of
essential business running essence or something that they want to wear off before? Or a state-led
economy that they might have been able to learn something from for their own state-led economic
reforms in their country? You don't need to think about it very hard to arrive at the latter
conclusion because the first option is kind of ridiculous, and that is in fact the case. The
Communist Party came to see Singapore as something of a reference precisely because it was an example
of an already existing model in which the state remained economically dominant. But apart from
that, Harris's timeline is again just totally messed up. Deng visited Singapore in 1978,
the same year in which the economic reforms in China began, but he and other Chinese officials
didn't start to promote Singapore as a special model to be followed in China until 1992. Before
that, it was just one of many different places that they'd studied, so their decision to begin
market reforms itself has really nothing to do with Singapore. For Harris though, it's very
convenient to reduce a complicated, multi-causal decision, one which was itself the result of
power struggles in the Communist Party, to a simple Eureka-style moment of epiphany. After decades of
the evil Mao denying his people prosperity, along with other positive-sounding nouns, Deng saw the
glory of the free market firsthand in Singapore, and he was so awed by its incredible greatness
that he had no choice but to go home and immediately replicate it. It comes off as a childish,
apocryphal propaganda story because it is one. In reality, the reforms were already underway
beforehand, the visit to Singapore was very short and uneventful, the Chinese government only started
paying special attention to Singapore 14 years later, and the reason they did so didn't actually
have much to do with free market capitalism at all, rather something quite antifical to it.
China's turn to a market-based but still state-dictated economy has infinitely more to do with
other factors, like the aforementioned political conflicts, chiefly among them the one of the
Soviet Union. So yeah, firstly, there was that, which led to China and the USA establishing
diplomatic relations again in 1972. Before this, the People's Republic of China had no access to
international governance systems like the UN, as they were mostly controlled by the West,
who had still considered the Republic of China government in Taiwan as the legitimate government
of all of China. So suddenly, all of the world's most important and richest markets, made up of
many countries who had spent the previous century colonizing China and most of the rest of the world,
were now finally open to China. This was a drastic and sudden change in circumstances
that enabled options that were previously closed to them, like foreign investment from the advanced
capitalist countries and the ability to export to them. Second, Deng Xiaoping had been inspired by
the new economic policy of the Soviet Union. After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government
under Lenin decided that because the country was overwhelmingly agrarian, much like China was,
that they would allow a state-directed capitalism in the hopes of developing an advanced industrial
capitalist society because Karl Marx had theorized that that would be something of a prerequisite
for communism. This was highly successful, as the USSR rapidly recovered from the devastation of its
Civil War and World War I. In 1961, following the disastrous attempt at rapid industrialization
known as the Great Leap Forward, Deng was then already the key player in an ill-fated attempt to
implement NEP-style reforms in China, to industrialize China in a very different way to the one that
Mao had just tried. So the idea before the market reforms that he started to implement in 1978
was not actually new at all. Not in the history of China, nor in the history of communism, nor even
in Deng's own political career. So the international conditions that enabled China's market reforms
only came to be in the 1970s, and that clearest precedent and inspiration didn't come from the
West in the 1970s, but from the East in the 1920s, and they had been proposed in China since at least
the 1960s. If it isn't already clear from everything that we've just gone over, Harris's narrative
of China joining the capitalist party in the West is also just plain chronologically impossible.
He clearly means to imply that China was inspired by free markets, neoliberal capitalism,
rather than the embedded liberalism of the Bretton Woods period, given his constant references to
arch neoliberal Milton Friedman, his earlier delineation between the Bretton Woods period and
the neoliberal period that came after, and the fact that he outright praises free market capitalism
like a dozen times. Actually more than that. But China's reforms actually started before the turn
to neoliberalism in the West. They started in 1978. Thatcher was elected in 1979, Reagan in 1981,
so they couldn't have been inspired by Friedman-style neoliberal reforms there,
because they hadn't even been implemented on a national level yet.
In this video, it really seems like Harris has like an uncontrollable desire to use the term
West as synonymous with correct and good. His presentation of the world is one where it's
just kind of self-evident that the only way forward is to copy the superior West. If something
happened that he considers to be good, he does everything possible to ultimately credit it to
Western influences or inspirations, without feeling any sort of need to actually back that up,
or check whether his argument even makes any chronological sense,
or consider the possibility that Chinese people might be capable of thinking for themselves,
having their own ideas, or being inspired by anything other than the same countries that
had colonized and devastated their own. This is juxtaposed with his treatment of Mao,
who was apparently just completely irrational and evil because that's the only way that Harris
can apparently think of that could possibly explain someone not simply copying the superior West.
It comes off as at least a little bit racist. In the next bit, Harris reduces all of Deng's
market reforms to just him focusing on one little village, the special economic zone of Shenzhen.
He frames it like Deng started out by creating a little secret capitalist project, developing
this one town into a bustling industrial city. But the reality is that this was just one small part
of a much wider reform program, which also included three other special economic zones
established in three other places at the same time. So why does he focus on it so heavily?
This remark makes it clear. Deng Xiaoping designated this little town as quote a special
economic zone, where foreign companies could set up and invest in a very capitalistic free market.
Claiming China's highly regulated, very state directed system as some sort of success of free
market capitalism would obviously be ridiculous. So in an attempt to get around this complication,
Harris, providing no evidence for his claims at all, says that Shenzhen had a free market,
and then he just casually acts like that represented the rest of China and that it was
replicated everywhere else. Despite having done absolutely nothing to even remotely argue for
or evidence this extremely false claim, he then uses it as the basis to claim China as a whole,
as a victory of the same type of free market capitalism that Milton Friedman espoused.
This starts happening all over China, and meanwhile Milton Friedman's back in the US being like
yep, told ya. Soon there were a bunch of cities designated in China for special economic activity,
or basically capitalism in a socialist country. Something I haven't mentioned yet is that big
parts of his narrative here are just ripped straight from the World Economic Forum propaganda book
that is being paid to promote here. I've actually been giving Harris way too much credit. He didn't
come up with like half of this stuff himself. The Singapore story, followed immediately by the
Shenzhen story, comes straight from the book, but Harris actually went even further than the book did.
Its description of China's special economic zones is simply that their places where foreign
companies were allowed to operate with some tax incentives under government imposed conditions,
in contrast to the rest of the country where such enterprises were entirely illegal,
are surprisingly accurate description, and far from free market capitalism.
Sometimes you can just refer back to the very book that he's advertising here,
and use it to refute him. Anyway, so onto the Milton Friedman part.
Friedman absolutely did not approve of China's state-led economy. He certainly may have liked
it more than what it had before, but it was far from anything close to resembling his neoliberal
ideal. We have direct evidence of this, because Friedman actually went to China and spoke with
Communist Party officials, who outright argued against him about the very fundamentals of his
beliefs. They had major disagreements on topics like private property rights, state interference in
the market, and state economic planning. If anything, China proved Friedman wrong, that the sort of
government interference that he so despised, could achieve what he'd claimed it couldn't.
But Harris, undeterred by the truth, just inverts reality yet again and claims the exact opposite.
One of the things you might have noticed that Harris does a lot in this video,
is to muddy the distinction between different types of capitalism, ironically while also trying
to create his own distinction between different types of capitalism. His video is very overtly
pro-free market capitalism specifically. Yet in one sentence, he'll talk about how great
the free market is, and then in the next, he'll just say capitalism alone. And this last bit
about China is where this muddying of the waters came to its head. China has obviously never had
anything resembling free market capitalism. Harris pays a tiny little bit of lip service to
this fact for like a second, then just forgets that he ever said that and immediately continues on,
as if China is nonetheless an example of the free market dogma that is trying to promote.
It's the same thing that he did earlier when he claimed the Bretton Woods period, and the
Marshall Plan as examples of miracles of the free market, rather than the heavy state economic
interference, planning, and control that actually characterised them. Johnny Harris in the corporations
that the World Economic Forum represents probably wouldn't be very happy if we went and looked at
the actual reality of China's state-led economy, with fairly routine executions of billionaires,
and took it as a model to be followed. Yet such is capitalist propaganda, contradictory by nature.
China becoming a world power through heavy state intervention, and very directed and deliberate
government-led economic policy, doesn't fit into their narrative of what kind of economic
policies are supposed to work best. So they need to obfuscate those facts and find roundabout ways
to claim that it's actually still somehow an example of the wonders of free market capitalism.
This video is a fine example of that practice. But wait, I haven't yet actually provided any
evidence for my claim that China doesn't have a free market economy. Silly me. Allow me to
cite a source, a book called Stakeholder Capitalism by the founder and head of the
World Economic Forum. In recent decades, another form of capitalism emerged as an alternative,
state capitalism. In China, to take the most notable example, the private sector now produces
more than 60% of GDP. Despite this, the state is still considered the most important stakeholder
and retains power over individual shareholders. The government achieves its dominant role in at
least three ways. First, it keeps a strong hand in the distribution of resources and opportunities.
Second, it can intervene in virtually any industry. And third, it can direct the economy
by means of large-scale infrastructure, research and development, education, healthcare, or housing
projects. So Harris' video is fundamentally based on this idea that China is a success of free market
capitalism, of freemanite neoliberalism, to the extent that China supposedly stands as proof
that Milton Friedman was right. Yet the book that he was paid to promote in this video says
something entirely different. That it's the prime example of something very different to the neoliberalism
that it misleadingly calls shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism. The book even gives
this state capitalism props, saying that, were it not for state capitalism, large parts of the
developing world may not have seen a major growth spurt at all. Yet Harris frames it entirely
differently, as if the free market is actually to thank for the perceived successes of state-led
interventionist economies. I don't mean to give the book any credit here. It's garbage,
ghost-ridden propaganda. It only acknowledges these things because they're undeniable,
and it does so to create this false impression of nuance so that the reader is more likely to be
convinced by its main argument that the way to fix the problems of neoliberal capitalism
is with more neoliberal capitalism, along with a nice helping of giving corporations even more
power. I just think it's telling that Harris clearly read the book, given that he both claimed
to have done so, and that parts of his video seemed to come directly from it. Yet to sustain
his argument that everything good ever is all thanks to the West's amazing free market capitalism,
he still has to editorialize the world economic forum propaganda book to get rid of the parts
where the book is frank about the fact that the things that he's crediting to the wonders of
Milton Friedman are actually due to something very different. Harris's video comes off as even more
of a piece of unthinking capitalist propaganda than the literal world economic forum propaganda
book does. Now let's move on to the big graph moment of the video, which comes out of nowhere
after Harris is finally done lying to us about how neoliberal capitalism actually saved the world
and made everything better, contrary to what all the evidence shows.
Grouped into percentiles. So these people down here make an income that is the 10th percentile,
the lowest 10% in the world, and then the 20th percentile, and so on and so on up to these
people up here who are the richest in the world, they have an income that puts them in the 90th
percentile. This axis here shows how much growth and income these people have had over the past
35 years, basically during the heyday of shareholder capitalism and the rise of China. So you'll see
how this plays out in just a second. Let's start plotting how much income growth each of these groups
saw over the past 35 years. The bottom 10% saw their incomes grow by around 75%, not bad. These
are people who live in the poorest countries who make the lowest income in the world. The 20 to 30
percentile saw huge growth in their income, 125% and more over the past 35 years. This is like the
new middle class in China and other Asian countries who saw huge income growth due to
globalization. They did really well under this system. Just want to pause for a second here
to note how Harris is again claiming China for what he calls shareholder capitalism,
despite the very book that he's promoting calling it something very different. But then you start
to get to the people in the 50th and 60th and 70th and 80th percentile. This is basically people who
live in the middle class in the West. Their incomes have grown much slower, sometimes under 50%
over the course of 35 years, which is little over 1% a year. Not very much income growth.
So did you notice the contradiction there? It's a pretty big one. Harris goes his entire video
telling us how awesome shareholder capitalism was for the West, how it made the economy explode,
and how it proved Milton Friedman right. But then the graph that his entire video led up to
paints a different picture. Now it seems that things actually didn't go that great for people
in the West. There's no consistency in this video at all. He just contradicts himself so often.
And some of these people in the West have seen their incomes shrink,
like the blue collar workers in Detroit and the rust belt whose jobs disappeared to China.
So so far you can sort of see why this makes sense. The people in China who benefited from this
mass industrialization saw huge benefits. And the people here in the United States and in the West
who saw jobs go overseas to China saw a way slower growth in their income.
So this spot is kind of ridiculous. Harris blames production moving to China for that portion of
the graph having comparatively less growth. But as we've already established, the US economy
continued to grow at the same average rate that it always had. And given that the income shares of
the top percentiles saw massive increases that work on current with this, it's clear that the
extra income from this growth was taken from them and given to the rich in their country,
rather than to normal people in China who are at the very bottom end of this graph.
Harris just can't seem to help himself here. He has to find some way in which he can blame
your woes on Chinese people, rather than the capitalists who are actually to blame because,
well, they're paying him to make this video, aren't they? I'll let him finish his spiel on the graph now.
But watch what happens next when we get to the groups of people who are at the 99 percentile,
basically the richest one percent in the world. And for this, I actually have to stretch out the
graph to get us a little bit more granular. These are the people who have the highest incomes in
the world. Let's see how their income has grown over the past 35 years. You can see that their
income has exploded under this system. They're seeing tripling of their income in the past 35
years. Now, a reminder that this is 35 years of data from every economy on earth. This shows
everyone on the planet. So this gives us a view of who are the winners and the losers of this
shareholder capitalism that has globalized to Asia and around the world. The top one percent
of income earners saw the biggest benefits from this system. They are the ones who disproportionately
benefit from shareholder capitalism and the growth of globalization.
Again, wait, wasn't this supposed to actually be super awesome for the West? So awesome that it
inspired China to copy it all? He said this earlier. So all the US and Western economies
are thriving because of this corporate free market capitalism that was taking over the world.
But his own framing of this graph is kind of contradicting that quite a bit.
Whatever. Anyway, so you probably won't be too surprised to find that this graph is extremely
cherry picked. It compares income growth rate, not actual income. For an example of why this is not
exactly very indicative of anything, let's say you make $1,000 a year and your income increases by,
say, 125%, like it did in this part of the graph here. Then you're now making $2,250 a year,
$1,250 more. But if someone say from this part of the graph, which Harris claims represents the
Western middle class, is making $50,000 a year, and this grows by only 45%, which seems much lower
in comparison, then that income has increased to $72,500 a year or $22,500 more, which in numeric
terms is 18 times more than the increase in income of those in the lower percentile. So while that
income might be growing at a slower rate, that's not really indicative of anything useful on its own.
Those in the middle can still be getting a much larger share of raw global income than those
at the bottom. The reason why propagandists like to use this so-called elephant graph,
comparing income growth instead of numerical increases in income, is because the latter graph
completely destroys the narrative that this elephant graph is used to push. That free market
neoliberalism has actually been mostly beneficial and has only been slightly negative for a relatively
small group of people in the West. That's wrong, and it would be even if we assumed, for the sake of
argument, that China, which makes up the vast majority of the growth in those lower income
sections of the graph, has a free market economy. The YouTuber Unlearning Economics has a great
video about this whole narrative of neoliberal progress, where he specifically refutes the
abuse of the elephant graph, so I'm just going to play that clip to explain it to you more.
This paints a picture of globalization as a largely positive, albeit flawed, process,
compressing the global income distribution by creating a much larger global middle class,
while neglecting the middle classes of the rich world, which have seen high and possibly
rising income inequality within their borders. But the elephant graph hides an assumption which
is pervasive in these debates. These are relative changes, expressed in percentages.
If you look at the raw changes in income, shown on this graph, the income gains are largely
flattened at the bottom of the distribution and the graph takes the familiar hockey stick shape,
albeit with a slight bump in the middle, due to the impressive growth of China and other
Southeast Asian countries. This is also in Lackner and Milanovic's original paper,
though the elephant version has been shared more widely. Although incomes rose by 60% for both the
top 1% and those in the middle of the global income distribution, this was an absolute increase
of $23,000 for the top 1%, but just $800 for the middle. The rich gained the same in relative
terms, but 30 times as much in absolute terms. The elephant shows the former measurement,
while the hockey stick shows the latter. The implication of this is pretty clear.
Almost all of the growth in the global economy was captured by those at the top of the distribution,
failing to go to those who need it most. Yeah, you heard that right. Both of these
graphs are from the same paper, yet those who pushed this narrative took one of them and ignored
the other. I wonder why? Take a look at the income growth of the bottom 20% here. Their incomes increased
by $217 in 30 years, adjusted for inflation, and purchasing power between different countries.
Now, what about someone in the top 80%, in line with the western middle class?
Their incomes increased by $2218. 10 times more. Again, this is adjusted for purchasing power parity,
so it's not like that money is worthless due to the higher prices of goods in richer countries.
It is actually just straight up 10 times more. So clearly, it's not the poor Chinese factory
worker whose income has increased by a whopping $217 in 30 years, who's robbed the average
westerner of their share of economic growth. It's the people represented on the far right side of
the graph, whose incomes increased by 28 times that of the global average. The elephant graph was
cherry picked by the World Economic Forum, Harris, and many other propagandists to mask
inconvenient facts for their narratives like these. So, Harris started out by claiming that
neoliberalism, which he calls shareholder capitalism and free market capitalism, increased
economic growth in the west by using a misleading graph of per capita GDP, which was not adjusted
for inflation. Now, he's implying that neoliberalism was actually disadvantageous for most people in
the west and that there was a massive redistribution in income from them to the rest of the world
and the richest 1% and up. This narrative is not only incredibly contradictory, but also untrue.
There was a massive redistribution in income, yes, but only to the top 1%. The empirical data,
no matter what metrics you use, no matter what variables you adjust by, consistently shows this.
Neoliberalism has accomplished absolutely nothing but the redistribution of income from the majority
of people to the richest people, and it's like that by design. So, next and finally,
Harris shows us a graph of global CO2 emissions for some reason. The second graph looks like this.
This shows the amount of CO2 emissions by country. You've got Europe and the United States,
and then up here you've got China, the world's largest emitter of CO2. Like the elephant graph,
this graph combines loads of data to show us that shareholder capitalism focuses so much on
short-term profits for shareholders that it leaves out any consideration for how this economic
activity affects the planet we live on and our ability to live on it. He makes sure to point out
that China now has the world's largest share of global CO2 emissions, when you measure them by
country at least, neglecting to mention that until, like, a couple of weeks ago actually, China had
the world's largest population, congratulations India, and it still has an approach to per capita
emissions over the west, and especially not the US, where the average person emits about three times
more than the average Chinese person. And given that Harris also noted in his video that
and more and more foreign companies flocked to China for its cheap labor, it became the world's
factory, then it would stand to reason that a fair bit of those emissions are also on behalf
of the west, yet they still count against China and not against them. His analysis of this graph
is very short and just seems kind of tacked on and superfluous, like he wanted to throw in a token
acknowledgement of climate change at the end, so that he could subsequently imply that stakeholder
capitalism would magically fix it, while also driving home the general sort of anti-China
vibe of this part of the video. Right after him telling us how awesome it was, that China finally
came to its senses and copied the free market capitalism that's work so great for the west,
there's this jarring tone shift. Now it seems that free market capitalism hasn't actually gone that
well for the west. China's success also came at the expense of the average westerner and China
even bears massive blame for climate change. So which is it? Is China an awesome example of free
market capitalism success or a massive threat to the livelihood and well-being of the average person
in the west? What's really most jarring about this to me though is that it seems like people don't
really notice when he does this. At least from reading the comments you won't really see anyone
picking up on these sorts of contradictions and incoherency. Kind of worrying to me and I hope
that maybe my video will sort of encourage people to consume YouTube content, not just Johnny Harris
videos, but all YouTube content with a bit more of a critical eye. Anyway, so it's especially
nonsensical for Harris to bring up climate change in this video because the only actual evidence that
he presents throughout the entire video for the supposed success of free market capitalism was
that one graph of raw GDP growth. For Harris, growth is just sort of good in of itself and it
improves what he calls prosperity yet that is precisely the sort of thinking that led to runaway
climate change. The reality is that as the last 40 to 50 years have shown there is not necessarily an
automatic correlation between economic growth and improvements in living standards. Growth just
means more national income and if most or all of that extra income is being distributed straight
to the people on top, the benefits for everyone else will be marginal or non-existent, while the
costs, like the impending climate catastrophe, will be shouldered primarily by everyone outside of
that privileged minority. And this is a big reason why capitalism just is never going to work that
well for most people. While particularly in state directed forms, it does grow wealth better than
the systems that came before it, it also creates a tiny minority of people with immense economic
and thus political power which they then use to ensure two things. One, that efforts at power and
income redistribution are stunted as much as possible so that as much of this growth as possible
goes straight to themselves. And two, that this growth continues as unabated as possible in order
to ensure themselves as much income as possible even as this makes the planet increasingly less
habitable for humans. The World Economic Forum is the most important representative body of exactly
that class of people and Johnny Harris was paid by them to make this video about how awesome economic
growth has supposedly been throughout the last 40 to 50 years or so, you know, with some very minor
caveats like runaway climate change and immense inequality that they only acknowledge because
they're now completely impossible to deny. But don't worry, they swear they'll fix them for us out of
the goodness of their hearts if we just adopt their vision of a new form of capitalism, which is
not only fundamentally the same as the old form of capitalism, but which would also just so happen
to hand them, the ones who cause these problems in the first place, copious amounts of additional
direct governmental power. Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. Anyway, so after the CO2 emissions
graph part, the conclusion that we dissected at the beginning of the video begins. So we're pretty
much done here. There's really just little about this video that makes any sense without the context
of it just being a particularly poorly made propaganda piece. It's just a guy presenting
a very disjointed historical narrative with massive unexplained time skips that's very
loosely based on reality where he insists that free market capitalism is responsible for anything
good that's ever happened while presenting nothing but a few misleading graphs or just outright
lying to sustain that narrative. Then at the end, he pulls out more misleading graphs,
contradicts everything that he just spent seven whole minutes telling you, and then insists
that the only way forward is to do exactly what the world's worst corporations tell us to do.
It is utterly embarrassing that Johnny Harris frames himself as a journalist who according to him
does copious amounts of research for his videos, including this one, where he gets pretty much
everything wrong, provides next to no evidence for his claims, and messes up to a comical level
when he does actually try to provide a source. And this video is indicative of the quality of
research across his entire channel. It's garbage. But unfortunately, it seems to work regardless
because he gets a whole lot of views. And as the link for this response video makes clear,
it takes infinitely more effort to refute made up bullshit than the effort that goes into making
up the bullshit. In conclusion, Johnny Harris is a liar. Worse. His lies are about as complex as
lying to a child that babies are delivered to your doorstep by stalks. Way worse. He took money to lie
in mislead on behalf of one of the world's most nefarious and damaging ultra-rich advocacy
organizations and even seemed proud of doing so when he was called out on it. If there's anything
actually useful that you should take from this video beyond that, it's one that neoliberalism
actually sucks, and that other forms of capitalism pretty much suck too, though quite a bit less.
And two, that all of the problems that I've outlined here about Johnny Harris' content
are not actually unique to his content. The vast majority of YouTube infotainment,
particularly historical infotainment, is exactly the same. It's just people who make
confident sounding statements that the audience is just supposed to take for granted because
they said so. It's rare for them to even explain their reasoning, let alone provide anything
resembling adequate evidence for it. The average YouTube history video is so bad that treating
it as anything more than background noise while you clean the house or something is a huge mistake.
