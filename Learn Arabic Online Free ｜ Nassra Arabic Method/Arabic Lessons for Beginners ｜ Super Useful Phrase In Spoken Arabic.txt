Hi guys, Zomar speaking and today I will teach you a very important phrase in Arabic,
especially if you are going to like you know to the Middle East or to Arabic country and
you are learning Arabic but you are not really like that you know quite confident yet and you
want to tell people that I only speak Arabic a little bit so they can actually slow down and you
can understand them okay even here in London if you have Arabic friends and you wanted to speak
with them Arabic and you want to tell them you know to slow down that you actually speak it with
Arabic so they can slow down for you okay so the phrase is
I speak Arabic a little bit
I speak Arabic a little bit
I speak I speak the hitch is a throat letter so it's not soft one like in English so
I speak Arabic again here the eye is throat letter so
a little bit is actually a phrase I mean like some some but that in English is a little bit
and actually we use it in different you know scenarios but for now just learn as a little bit
okay so one more time
again
