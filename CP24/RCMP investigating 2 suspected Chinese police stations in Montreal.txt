China is accusing Canada of damaging its reputation by claiming it is secretly
operating two police stations in Quebec. Beijing says Canada should stop
sensationalizing the matter and stop attacks and smears on it the country.
A foreign ministry spokesperson says China has been strictly abiding by
international law and respecting all countries judicial sovereignty. This comes
after the RCMP said it's investigating two alleged secret police stations at
facilities in the Montreal area. Both are run by local city counselor Shishi
Lee. Police are investigating three others believed to be in the Toronto area.
