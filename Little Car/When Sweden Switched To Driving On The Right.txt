Dagen H or H-Day was the day on the 3rd of September 1967 in which the traffic in Sweden
switched from driving on the left hand side of the road to the right. Dagen means day
and the H stands for hurger traffic, the Swedish word for right traffic. It was by far the
largest logistical event in Sweden's history. The first attempt to order traffic to the right
was in 1718, but by 1734 ordinances had stipulated Sweden should drive on the left. This of course
didn't matter too much until motor traffic became common and with Sweden's neighbours Norway and
Finland driving on the right, border crossings were a very awkward dance. Sweden was starting to
think more globally and driving on the right would put it in line with many other members
of the new common market. The Swedish government had been making noises to change over to the
right since 1927 and that had encouraged car manufacturers such as Saab and Volvo to design
their cars for right hand drive roads, but this led to many head-on collisions when passing on
narrow two lane highways. Despite this the change was unpopular. In a 1955 referendum 83% voted to
keep driving on the left. In a move that wouldn't be the first or the last to ignore popular opinion
after it had given them the answer they didn't want, in 1963 the Swedish parliament approved the
Prime Minister's proposal of right hand drive traffic beginning in 1967 as the number of cars
on the road tripled from 500,000 to one and a half million and the problem was only expected to get
worse with more people driving. A commission was established to oversee the change and began to
implement a four-year education program. The campaign included displaying the DAG and H logo
on various commemorative items including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a
contest for songs promoting the change and the winning entry that became a popular hit
was a song called Keep to the Right Svensson. Surprisingly there was actually a bit of road
in Sweden where people already drove on the right. The road between Kv√§lje and Tundtje in
Norway had been drawn incorrectly and a bit of it went over the border into Sweden. Although this
was now a Swedish road to avoid having to swap the sides of the road twice for this short section
of road it was agreed to keep drivers on the right hand side. As DAG and H neared every intersection
was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic.
Workers roamed the streets early in the morning removing the plastic. Existing road lines were
yellow so before the changeover white lines were painted then covered with black tape.
Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, 20,000 of them in Stockholm alone.
Some signs were mirrored such as the roadwork sign and the sign warning of moose crossings
as it was felt that the moose were more likely to come from the right hand side of the road.
Black hexagonal signs with a letter H were placed on roads to remind drivers to drive on the right
and while they were altering signs the government took the opportunity to impose
speed restrictions on certain roads. One way streets presented unique problems,
bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street and intersections had to
be reshaped to allow traffic to merge. It's still possible to spot motorway sections built before
the changeover as the on-ramps are shorter than usual and off-ramps longer. New cars from 1966
had headlights that were designed for driving on the right but special stickers were applied
with strict instructions that they shouldn't be removed until the switchover. On the day itself
all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 1am to 6am. Any vehicles on the roads
during that time had to follow special rules. All vehicles had to come to a complete stop at 450am
then carefully change to the right hand side of the road and stop again to give others time
to switch sides of the road and avoid head-on collision before being allowed to proceed at 5am.
In the large cities of Stockholm and Malmo the ban was longer from 10am on saturday
until 3pm on sunday to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections and other towns
also saw extended bans. Despite the transition being in the middle of the night it was covered with
probably not that scintillating live TV coverage. Over 10,000 police and military personnel monitored
the process along with over 100,000 people helping out at pedestrian crossings.
The relatively smooth changeover saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents.
Experts suggested that changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking
as people already drove left-hand drive vehicles thereby having a better view of the road ahead.
People were also lightly more cautious and alert driving on the other side of the road
which reduced accidents. Fatal car to car and car to pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result
the number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%. Of course these initial improvements didn't
last, the number of motor insurance claims returned to normal over the next six weeks and by
1969 the accident rates were back to the level seen before the change although more cars were
on the road by then. Trams in many cities were withdrawn and replaced with buses. In the run-up
to the change local authorities had been buying buses designed to be driven on the right but
some 7,500 existing buses were converted putting doors on the other side starting 18 months before
the switchover. The cities of Gothenburg and Malmo sent their existing buses to Pakistan and Kenya
who drove on the left. The modification of buses was the largest cost of the change.
Although all Swedish road traffic switched to drive on the right metro and railways didn't change
and continued to drive on the left. Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the right
the following year on a day known as H. Dagurin. A big thank you to all my Patreons for supporting
