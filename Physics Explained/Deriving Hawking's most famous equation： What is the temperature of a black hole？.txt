According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a black hole is a region of
space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
The boundary of this region is known as the event horizon of the black hole, and
according to classical relativity, once an object has passed the event horizon, it
will never be able to escape the clutches of the black hole. However, when you
throw quantum mechanics into the mix, as is often the case, the situation becomes
a bit more subtle. In fact, in 1974, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that by
combining certain elements of quantum field theory with general relativity,
it was possible to show that black holes do in fact radiate, causing them to
slowly evaporate and eventually disappear. Now, I don't know about you, but when I
first read about black holes as a child, I was instantly hooked and desperately
wanted to find out more. The only problem is that the physics of black holes, and
in particular Hawking's work, is notoriously difficult and requires an
advanced knowledge of Einstein's theory of general relativity, as well as
quantum field theory. But is it possible to determine the most exciting and
mysterious properties of black holes using only advanced high school
mathematics? Well, it turns out the answer is yes, and in this short video, I'd like
to show you how. In fact, our strategy is quite simple. We are essentially going
to guess the structure of the black hole equations without doing the full
calculation, using a handy technique known as dimensional analysis.
Dimensional analysis is perhaps the most valuable tool in a theoretical
physicist's toolkit, as it allows you to construct equations without doing any of
the hard work, and as you will see, it's remarkably successful. So how does it
work? Well, the first thing to appreciate is that an equation in physics
simply represents a relationship between physical properties, and a
measurable physical property is referred to as a dimension. In what follows, we
will focus on the basic dimensions of length, time, mass, and temperature, which
we will signify with the letters L, T, M, and theta. To understand what I mean by
dimensional analysis, let's look at a simple example. The great thing about
physics equations is that they provide a relationship between the dimensions of
the properties appearing in the equation. For example, consider the equation
speed equals distance divided by time. To determine the dimensions of speed, we
simply refer to the defining equation, which tells us that the dimension of
speed is equal to the dimension of length divided by time. Square brackets are
used to signify that we are interested in the dimension of the quantity inside
the bracket. Now it turns out that some physics equations are special, in the
sense that they contain what are known as fundamental constants. A fundamental
constant is a physical quantity that is believed to be universal in nature and
constant in time. The most famous example being the speed of light, which appears
in the famous equation equals mc squared. This equation allows us to calculate the
mass energy of an object if we know its mass. The speed of light, c, is a
fundamental constant that tells us the exchange rate between mass and energy.
Since c refers to a speed, the dimensions of c can be written as c equals l over t.
We also note that we can use the equation equals mc squared to determine the
dimensions of energy, which can be written as ml squared over t squared.
Let's now use this dimensional information to explore some of the other
fundamental constants that will prove crucial to our understanding of black
holes. Firstly, consider the gravitational potential energy that exists
due to the relative position of two or more masses. If two masses are separated
by a distance r, then the gravitational potential energy can be calculated
using the equation e equals minus g big m little m over r, where g is Newton's
gravitational constant. By rearranging this equation and inserting the
dimensions of energy that we calculated previously, we find that the units of g
are equal to l cubed over mt squared. Next, consider the famous quantum energy
relation e equals h bar omega, which relates the energy of a quantum of light
to the frequency of the light. Here, h bar is the reduced Planck's constant.
In order to determine the dimensions of h bar, we simply rearrange the energy
equation, and since frequency has dimensions of inverse time, we see that
the dimensions of h bar is ml squared over t. The final fundamental constant
that we'll be concerned with relates to the field of thermodynamics, and more
specifically systems of large numbers of particles. According to the kinetic
theory of gases, for a system of n particles at temperature t, such as an
ideal gas, the thermal energy is related to the temperature by the equation e
equals 3 over 2 n kt, where k is Boltzmann's constant. By rearranging this
equation for Boltzmann's constant, we see that the dimensions of Boltzmann's
constant is given by ml squared over theta t squared. Having laid the
necessary foundations, we're now in a position to start building equations
using the fundamental constants as our building blocks. The rules of the game
are as follows. When using dimensional analysis to construct equations, we
should include the speed of light c when things are moving fast, or involve light.
We should include the gravitational constant g when things are massive. We
should include Planck's constant when dealing with quantum systems, and we
should include Boltzmann's constant when things are hot. It sounds simple, so let's
get started. Our objective is to uncover the properties of black holes using
dimensional analysis. The good news is that our task is made significantly
easier because of a famous theorem known as the no-hair theorem. The no-hair
theorem states that all black hole solutions in general relativity can be
completely characterized by only three externally observable classical
parameters, mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. All other information,
for which hair is a metaphor about the matter that formed a black hole, disappears
behind the black hole event horizon, and is therefore permanently inaccessible to
external observers. In what follows, we will focus on a special class of black
holes known as Schwarzschild black holes, which have neither electric charge
nor angular momentum, and therefore a Schwarzschild black hole is completely
characterized by its mass. Armed with the no-hair theorem and dimensional
analysis, we are now in a position to answer the following question. What is the
area of the event horizon of a black hole? Well firstly, black holes are clearly
massive objects, and so our equation should include Newton's gravitational
constant G, along with the characteristic mass of the black hole M. Furthermore, we
know that a black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
nothing, not even light, can escape, and so we should expect the speed of light to
feature in our equation. Our strategy is to write the area of the event horizon
as A equals G to the power alpha times C to the power beta times M to the power
gamma, and then we will use dimensional analysis to determine alpha, beta and gamma.
So let's do that. To fix alpha, beta and gamma, we simply need to match the
dimensions on either side of this expression. The left-hand side represents
an area which has dimensions of length squared. For the right-hand side, we need
to insert the dimensions of G and C that we calculated earlier. If we do that, then
we find the following green expression. We can then use the law of exponents to
gather terms and simplify this expression, in which case we find the
following. Now, since the dimensions on both sides of the equation need to match,
this places a set of constraints on alpha, beta and gamma. To make this clear, we can
imagine writing the left-hand side in an equivalent form as follows. We can do
this because any quantity raised to the power of 0 is simply equal to 1. If we
then match up the exponents of L, T and M, we find a set of three simultaneous
equations which can be solved by substitution. After a little bit of
algebra, we find that alpha equals 2, beta equals minus 4 and gamma equals 2. If we
then sub these values into our original expression, we find that the area of the
event horizon of a black hole is proportional to G squared, M squared,
divided by C to the power of 4. In other words, the area of the event horizon
will increase as more mass falls into the black hole. More specifically, we see
that if the mass of our black hole doubles, then the area of the event
horizon will quadruple. And so we begin to see the power of dimensional analysis.
Although we don't know the exact value of the proportionality constant appearing in
the mass area expression, dimensional analysis does allow us to determine the
structure of the relationship, and often this is the most important part of an
equation. It's interesting to note that a detailed calculation of the black hole
event horizon yields the following exact expression, and we see that the
structure of this expression does indeed match the one derived using
dimensional analysis. So why is this mass area relationship important, and what
is it telling us about black holes? Well the first thing to appreciate is that
from a classical point of view, nothing can ever escape from inside the event
horizon of a black hole, and therefore in all physical processes, the area of the
event horizon can only ever increase. It can never decrease. Now, the idea that
there exists a quantity that can only ever increase with time might remind you
of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an
isolated system must increase with time. Because entropy is such an important
concept and a key part of our analysis of black holes, it's worth taking a short
detail to understand the concept in a bit more detail. The concept of thermodynamic
entropy was first introduced into gas dynamics by the German physicist Rudolf
Clausius. Clausius had introduced the concept to describe the flow of heat. He
originally defined the change in entropy of a system as the heat energy it
absorbed divided by the temperature at which it absorbed the heat. The
remarkable discovery of Clausius was that because heat always moves from high
temperature regions to low temperature regions, the total change in entropy
summed over all the parts of the system that were exchanging heat with one
another was always positive. The entropy was always increasing. But why is this
true? Although Clausius had successfully introduced the mathematical definition of
entropy, he was unable to provide a fundamental explanation of why the
second law of thermodynamics was true. However, in 1877 the Austrian physicist
Ludwig Boltzmann provided a beautiful explanation of entropy in terms of the
microscopic components of a physical system. According to Boltzmann, the
entropy of a system is simply characterized by the number of ways of
rearranging the microscopic components of the system in such a way that some
macroscopic feature such as the pressure or temperature remains unchanged. This
statement is encoded in Boltzmann's famous entropy law which can be found
etched into his gravestone. According to Boltzmann's definition, the entropy of
a system is equal to Boltzmann's constant multiplied by the logarithm of W, where
W is the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macro
state. To make this a bit clearer, imagine the bottom of a box is completely
covered with red and green marbles. Now imagine that you arrange the marbles so
that the left half is green and the right half is red. This corresponds to a
particular appearance or macro state of the system. Let's label this macro state
as the split state. If we then shook the box of marbles so that the two sets of
marbles became thoroughly mixed together, we would see a random arrangement of the
marbles which we might label as a mixed macro state. If we then shook the box
again, we would get a different arrangement of the marbles but we would
still label the macro state of the system as being mixed. In fact, there are a huge
number of marble configurations or microstates corresponding to a mixed
macro state. On the other hand, there are clearly fewer ways for the marbles to
arrange themselves into the neatly separated split state. Boltzmann's
great insight was to realise that he could define the entropy as the number
of microstates corresponding to a particular macro state. Fewer microstates
corresponds to lower entropy and therefore more order in the system. So
what has this got to do with black holes? Well, you can think of a black hole as a
universal waste basket that swallows up information as matter falls inside. Since
a black hole refuses to tell us what has fallen inside, we can view a black hole
as a system that has the same external state for lots of possible internal
states. This suggests that the black hole may have a very large entropy value. But
exactly how large? Well, we've already uncovered the first clue when we
discovered that the area of the horizon of the black hole always increases when
mass falls inside. In 1972, Jacob Beckenstein, an Israeli physicist, proposed
that it does indeed make sense to assign an entropy to a black hole, and further
more that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event
horizon. In other words, Beckenstein suggested that it should be possible to
write s equals eta times a, where eta is a constant of proportionality. So how
might we determine eta? Well, the first thing we need to do is determine the
dimensions of entropy, since this will then allow us to figure out the
dimensions of eta. To do this, we refer back to the thermodynamic definition of
entropy, ds equals dq over t, which tells us that entropy has dimensions of
energy divided by temperature. And so we find that entropy has dimensions of ml
squared t to the minus 2 theta to the minus 1. We can then use this to determine
the dimensions of eta, since eta is equal to the entropy divided by the area.
And so we see that the dimensions of eta must be mt to the minus 2 theta to the
minus 1. Furthermore, we know that eta is a constant, and therefore eta must be
constructed from quantities which are themselves constant in time. And this
provides a strong hint that eta can be built using the fundamental constants
we encountered earlier. But which constant shall we use in our dimensional
analysis? Well, this is where we need to make an educated guess. Firstly, we are
dealing with gravity in black holes, and so we should expect the gravitational
constant and speed of light to be involved. Furthermore, since we are trying
to construct an equation for entropy, and entropy is connected to thermodynamics,
it makes sense to include Boltzmann's constant. And finally, following the
suggestion of Beckenstein in his original 1972 paper, we should also include
Planck's constant. As Beckenstein himself commented, we need not be alarmed at the
appearance of H-bar in the expression for black hole entropy. It is well known
that H-bar also appears in the equations for entropy of many thermodynamic
systems that are conventionally regarded as classical. For example, the
Boltzmann ideal gas. This is a reflection of the fact that entropy is, in a sense,
a count of states of the system, and the underlying states of any system are
always quantum in nature. And so, following in the footsteps of Beckenstein, we will
propose that eta can be written as G to the alpha, H-bar to the beta, C to the
gamma times K to the delta. So, how do we determine alpha, beta, gamma and delta?
Well, as we've already seen, we simply need to apply the rules of
dimensional analysis. So, let's do that. Firstly, we have already calculated the
dimensions of eta from the definition of thermodynamic entropy. Secondly, we know
that the combined dimensions of G, H-bar, C and K must match these. If we substitute
the dimensions we calculated earlier for the fundamental constants, then we find
the following yellow expression. If we then use the law of exponents to gather
appropriate terms together, we can write this expression in the following form.
Just like before, we can then match exponents on either side of the equation
to form a set of simultaneous equations. If we do this, then we find the following
set of constraints. We can then solve this set of simultaneous equations by
substitution, and we find that alpha and beta equal minus 1, gamma equals 3, and
delta equals 1. If we then substitute these expressions back into the original
equation proposed by Beckenstein, we find that, up to an undetermined numerical
factor, the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the following expression.
In 1974, using a subtle and sophisticated combination of general relativity and
quantum field theory, Stephen Hawking was able to show that the exact form of the
entropy equation includes a numerical factor of exactly one-quarter, and so the
modern-day expression for black hole entropy is written as s equals k c cubed
over 4 h bar g times the area of the event horizon. One of the most
immediately striking aspects of this expression is that the entropy of a
black hole is going to be incredibly large, since the equation contains a
factor of c cubed in the numerator and both Planck's constant and Newton's
gravitational constant in the denominator. So what is causing this large
entropy value? Well, according to Boltzmann, the entropy of a system relates to
the number of possible microstates of the system. So if we apply this to black
holes, it suggests that black holes should have some kind of microstructure
which we can use to count states. Furthermore, the presence of both Newton's
gravitational constant and Planck's constant in the entropy equation suggests
that these black hole microstates might have something to do with a quantum
theory of gravity. We will return to these interesting observations towards
the end of this video, but for now we wish to use the entropy equation to
understand one of the most exciting predictions of 20th century physics,
Hawking radiation. In 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered a remarkable fact
about the universe. Black holes glow, emitting faint radiation, causing them
to eventually evaporate and disappear. The exact mechanism behind Hawking
radiation involves a complex and subtle interplay between the curvature of
spacetime caused by the event horizon and quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of
empty space, a topic which I hope to return to in a future video. Hawking
discovered that since radiation appears to be emitted from the region of space
surrounding the event horizon of the black hole, it should be possible to
assign an absolute temperature to the black hole, the aptly named Hawking
temperature. Furthermore, because mass and energy are seen as equivalent
according to Einstein's theory, when a black hole radiates energy, it effectively
loses mass and therefore should eventually evaporate. So let's now turn our
attention to these remarkable discoveries and see if we can calculate the Hawking
temperature and evaporation time of a black hole using our rudimentary tool
kit. Our start point is to combine the first law of thermodynamics with the
definition of thermodynamic entropy that we encountered earlier. Assuming that
the black hole does no work on its surroundings, we can set dw equal to
zero and so we can write de equals t times ds, where de refers to the change in
energy of the black hole, t for thermodynamic temperature and ds the
entropy. If we then rewrite this expression in terms of the temperature t,
we have that t equals de by ds. Next, if we assume that the total energy content
of the black hole is due to the mass contained within it, then we can use
Einstein's famous equation to write e equals mc squared. If we then combine
this with the expression for t, we see that the temperature of the black hole
can be written in the following form, which we can then invert and write as c
squared times the inverse of ds by dm. So we see that in order to calculate the
temperature of our black hole, we need to differentiate the black hole entropy
with respect to mass. And so our next task is to rewrite the Beckenstein-
Hawking entropy equation in terms of mass. To do that, we simply need to
substitute the event horizon area equation into the entropy equation and we
find that s is proportional to the square of the black hole mass. If we then
differentiate this entropy equation with respect to m, then we find the
following green equation. And so we are now finally in a position to determine
the thermodynamic temperature of a black hole. We simply need to substitute
this green expression into the equation we wrote for the thermodynamic
temperature. If we do this, then we find that the temperature of our black hole
can be written as h bar times c cubed divided by 8 pi kgm. This temperature is
known as the Hawking temperature of the black hole and it's the temperature that
we associate with the radiation being emitted from the black hole. One
immediately striking feature of this expression is that the Hawking temperature
is inversely proportional to the mass. And so the smaller the mass of a black
hole, the higher the temperature. And therefore unlike most objects, a black
hole's temperature increases as it radiates away its mass. But what kind of
temperatures are we talking about? If we sub in the values for the fundamental
constants, then we find that the Hawking temperature can be approximated by the
following blue expression. To get a sense of scale, the smallest stellar mass
black hole that is so far being discovered has a mass of around three
solar masses. If we insert this mass into the blue equation, then we see that the
Hawking temperature is around 2 times 10 to the minus 8 Kelvin, which is about
20 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. By way of comparison, we know that
the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 2.7
Kelvin. And therefore a black hole of this mass would actually be absorbing far
more energy than it emits and wouldn't begin to lose mass until the universe has
expanded sufficiently to reduce the temperature of the cosmic microwave
background radiation. Okay, but let's for a moment assume that the universe has
expanded sufficiently and the black hole begins to lose mass through Hawking
radiation. How long will it take for all the energy of the black hole to
radiate away? To answer this question, we need to determine the power output of the
black hole. The rationale being that since power is defined as energy per unit
time, if we know the energy content of the black hole and the power output, then
we can calculate the time taken for the energy to radiate away. So our next task
is to determine how the power output of a black hole relates to the Hawking
temperature. To this we now turn. Our start point is to use dimensional analysis
to estimate the power emitted per unit area from an object with temperature
T. Since we're dealing with radiation, we should expect our equation to include
the speed of light and since we're dealing with heat, we expect our equation to
include Boltzmann's constant along with the temperature T. And finally, we will
also include Planck's constant. After all, it was by explaining the radiation
properties of hot objects that Planck was first led to introduce the constant
that bears his name. So let's begin by assuming that the power per unit area
depends on the fundamental constants in the following way. As before, we can
determine the constants alpha, beta and gamma and delta by matching the
dimensions on either side of the equation. We see that the left-hand side has
dimensions of mT to the minus 3, whereas the right-hand side is given by the
following blue expression. If we expand out the brackets and simplify, then we
find the following green expression. If we then match up the exponents on either
side of the equation, we find the following set of simultaneous equations,
which can be solved to find that alpha equals minus 3, beta equals minus 2, and
gamma and delta equal 4. And therefore, we see that the power per unit area is
given by the following green equation, which you might recognize as the famous
Stefan-Boltzmann relation, which says that the power per unit area of a hot
object is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. A detailed
quantum mechanical calculation yields the well-known exact result, and we see
that the numerical coefficient is equal to pi squared over 60. If you're
interested in how this result is derived, I refer you to my video on the cosmic
microwave background radiation. For our purposes, let's use the Stefan-Boltzmann
relation to estimate the power output of our three solar mass black hole, which
if you recall, had a Hawking temperature of 2 times 10 to the minus 8 Kelvin. If
we plug in the numbers, then we find that the power output of the black hole is
incredibly small, around 10 to the power of minus 29 watts. For comparison, our
sun has a power output of around 10 to the power of 26 watts. Given the incredibly
small power output of a black hole, we might expect that it will take a very
long time for a black hole to evaporate. But exactly how long? To answer this
question, we first note that because the power of the black hole will be changing
with time, we will need to express the power relation in differential form as
De by dt. The appearance of the minus sign is due to the fact that the power of
the Hawking radiation is the rate of energy loss of the black hole. Next, we
need to take the Stefan-Boltzmann relation and rewrite this in terms of the
mass of our black hole. To do this, we need to substitute the expressions for
the event horizon area and Hawking temperature that we've already met. If we
do this, then we find the following blue equation. Note that as the mass of the
black hole decreases, the power output will actually increase. Next, we will
rewrite the energy in terms of the mass by using Einstein's equation equals mc
squared, where m is the total mass of the black hole. If we sub this into the
differential expression, then we can write our power equation in terms of the
rate of change of mass instead of the rate of change of energy. This makes sense
because the right-hand side of the equation is expressed in terms of the
mass. In order to solve this equation, we will use the method of separation of
variables. The first step is to rearrange this equation so that we have m
squared dm on the left-hand side and dt on the right-hand side. If we then
integrate both sides of this equation with respect to t, we find the following
yellow expression, where t equals 0 refers to when the black hole starts
evaporating and t refers to some later time. Integrating m squared will give a
factor of m cubed over 3 on the left-hand side, whereas integrating with
respect to time on the right-hand side will give rise to a factor of t. If we
then insert the limits, we find the following result. We can then use this
expression to estimate the time taken for an isolated black hole to evaporate
completely. In other words, the time taken for a black hole to lose all of its
mass. To do this, let's define t equals t evaporation as the moment in time when
the mass of the black hole has reduced to 0. If we then substitute this
information back into our equation and simplify, we find the following green
equation expressed in terms of the evaporation time. Finally, if we rearrange
for t, then we find that the evaporation time is proportional to the cube of the
mass of the black hole. Plugging in the values for the constants, we find that
the evaporation time is roughly equal to 10 to the power of minus 16 times m cubed,
where m is the mass of the black hole at the start of the evaporation process. If
we again consider a black hole of three solar masses, then we find that the
evaporation time is of order 10 to the 68 years. Considering the universe is
believed to be around 13.8 billion years old, we see that the time taken for
evaporation is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the
universe, and therefore a solar mass black hole is likely to be around long
after all the stars in the universe have died out, making it highly unlikely that
we'll ever observe the black hole's final farewell. So is there any way that a
black hole might evaporate in a shorter period of time? Well, a quick glance at
the black hole evaporation equation reveals that the only factor affecting
the evaporation time is the black hole mass. Could it be possible then that a
black hole with sufficiently small mass, perhaps created in the early universe, has
an evaporation time roughly equal to the age of the universe? That way, the
primordial black hole could be coming towards the end of its life at the
present moment, and we might be able to detect the dying radiation burst of the
black hole. Well, it turns out that it's relatively straightforward to estimate
what the mass of such a black hole would need to be. We simply rearrange the
black hole evaporation equation for M and substitute the age of the universe,
and we find that the initial mass of the black hole must have been around 10 to
the power 11 kilograms, which is roughly equivalent to the mass of an asteroid.
Now according to our current laws of physics, a black hole of such small
mass could not have formed as a result of stellar death, as is typical for black
hole formation. Rather, it's conceivable that such primordial black holes might
have formed by random fluctuations in the very early universe, and if so, these
primordial black holes should be coming towards the end of their lives. So what
exactly happens during the last few moments of a black hole's life? Well, we
can estimate the amount of energy released in the last second of a black
hole's life because this is equal to the energy equivalent of the mass of a black
hole whose lifetime equals one second. So if we sub in T equals one into the
evaporation equation, we find that the black hole radiates the energy equivalent
of 10 to the power 5 kilograms of mass during its final second. We can work out
how much energy this corresponds to by using Einstein's famous equation equals
mc squared, and we find the value of around 10 to the power of 22 joules. By
way of comparison, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated on Earth, known as
the SA-bomber, released 10 to the 17 joules of energy, and so we see that the
energy released in the final one second of a black hole is roughly equivalent to
the energy released by 100,000 SA nuclear bombs. So could we detect this? The
release of this much energy in one second might just be observable here on
Earth. Although it's only a fraction of a percent of the luminosity of the sun,
it would come out in a characteristic burst of gamma rays which could hopefully
be detected. But how do we know it would be gamma rays? Well that comes from the
Vien displacement law, which says that for an object at temperature T, the
wavelength corresponding to peak intensity emission is inversely
proportional to the temperature. I refer you to my video on the cosmic microwave
background radiation for a derivation of this result. For our purposes, we can
estimate the wavelength of peak emission by inserting the Hawking temperature
corresponding to a black hole of mass 10 to the 5 kilograms, and we find that the
peak wavelength is of order 10 to the minus 21 meters, which is in the high
energy gamma wavelength range of electromagnetic radiation. And therefore
the hope is that it should be possible to detect this characteristic burst of
gamma radiation, which signals the last few moments of an evaporating black
hole's life. It's worth noting that so far nothing of this nature has ever been
observed, and therefore at this stage primordial black holes represent a purely
theoretical idea. I would like to end by briefly discussing another important
theoretical consequence of Hawking radiation, the famous black hole
information paradox. Soon after Hawking realized that black holes evaporate, he
recognized a serious problem. Imagine throwing a laptop or a book or even a
human being into a black hole. What happens to all of this information? The
problem that Hawking recognized is that the thermal radiation emitted from a
black hole as it evaporates has no memory whatsoever of what went into the
black hole in the first place. As we've already seen, only the mass and therefore
temperature of the black hole determines what type of radiation is emitted, and
this would seem to imply that information has been lost. In other words, we cannot
use the Hawking radiation emitted from a black hole to reconstruct the information
content of what originally fell inside. Now this might not immediately strike you
as a problem, however the irretrievable loss of information conflicts with one
of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics. According to the Schrodinger
equation, physical systems that change over time cannot create or destroy
information, a property known as unitarity. This apparent contradiction
between general relativity and quantum mechanics is the information paradox, so
either quantum mechanics is wrong or the information somehow gets out of the black
hole. One possible solution to the problem is known as the holographic
principle, which suggests that the information content of a black hole is
somehow encoded on the event horizon of the black hole. So let's look at this
suggestion in a bit more detail. As we've already seen, Beckenstein and Hawking
were able to relate the entropy of a black hole to the area of the event
horizon. However, according to Boltzmann's definition of entropy, it should be
possible to define the entropy in relation to some fundamental microstates of
the black hole system. So what could these fundamental microstates be? To shed
some light on this, notice that we can rewrite the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy
equation in terms of the Planck length, which, if you recall, is believed to be
the smallest meaningful distance that we can probe in nature. If we square the
Planck length, we get the Planck area, and notice that the Planck area is
actually contained within the Beckenstein-Hawking relation. In particular, we
can write the entropy as s equals k over 4 times the area of the horizon
divided by the Planck area. So we see that the entropy of a black hole is
proportional to the number of Planck areas that would cover the area of the
black hole event horizon. So what does this mean? Well, perhaps we could use these
Planck-sized pixels to somehow encode the information that has fallen into the
black hole. More specifically, imagine that each Planck-sized cell corresponds to
one bit of stored information. So for example, with one bit corresponding to
one Planck-sized cell, we can encode two possible states corresponding to zero and
one. With two bits or two cells, we can describe four states corresponding to
zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, and one, one. Continuing this pattern, we see that
with n bits or n cells, we can describe two to the n states corresponding to the
two to the n sequences of binary digits. Then according to Boltzmann, the entropy
of the system would be equal to Boltzmann's constant multiplied by the
logarithm of the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macro
state. Well, if we take two to the n as the number of microstates, then we see
that the entropy would be proportional to the logarithm of two to the n. We can
then use the logarithm rule for exponents to show that the log of two to the n is
proportional to n. And we have already established that the
number of cells is proportional to the area of the black hole of n
horizon. And so we see we recover the Beckenstein-Hawking
relation. To get a sense of just how much information
a black hole could store using these Planck-sized cells,
that's for the purposes of illustration, imagine that we have a tiny black hole
the size of a proton with a radius of order 10 to the minus 15 meters.
We can then estimate the number of bits as the ratio of the area of the event
horizon to the Planck area. And we see that we can answer around 10
to the power of 41 bits, which is roughly 10 to the 31 gigabytes.
Compare this to the total data storage on all the computers in the world,
which is of order 10 to the 12 gigabytes. And we see that a proton-sized black hole
could contain more information than all the world's computers
by an unimaginably large factor. This general idea that information is stored
on the black hole horizon is known as the holographic principle,
since the information that falls into a black hole
is somehow encoded on the two-dimensional boundary, like a hologram.
And therefore, according to this set of ideas, the information swallowed by a black hole
could be completely restored during the process of quantum evaporation,
since it always existed on the boundary of the black hole.
The exact mechanism explaining how this restoration of information takes place
is still an open question in theoretical physics,
but there has been significant progress over the past 30 years
to flesh out and generalize the holographic principle,
especially within the context of string theory.
The remarkable conclusion that comes out of this line of reasoning
is the realization that in order to describe what is going on in a volume of space,
we need only concern ourselves with the physics that resides on the boundary of the volume.
You can think of a region of space as being surrounded by tiny,
plank-sized pixelated cells, and when things move around inside the volume,
that information is somehow encoded in those cells.
You can picture them lighting up.
As you put more stuff inside the volume of space, more of the pixels light up.
And at the exact moment just before the volume of space collapses to form a black hole,
all of the pixels have lit up.
In other words, all of the information is at the boundary, not inside the space.
What controls the physics lives on the boundary of the space,
and this is the essence of the holographic principle.
A detailed discussion of the holographic principle within the context of string theory
will no doubt form the basis of a future video.
But for now, I would like to leave you with the words of one of the founding fathers
of the holographic principle, Leonard Susskind.
The universe, filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders and people,
is a hologram, an image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface.
This new law of physics, known as the holographic principle,
asserts that everything inside a region of space
can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.
Thank you for watching, and see you next time.
