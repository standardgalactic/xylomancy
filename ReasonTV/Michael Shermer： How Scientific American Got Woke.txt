The second wave feminists I've talked to, they're very just worried about the kind of
woke gender identity movement because it's reducing women to just body parts.
Like a guy can say, well, if I just get breast implants and I can have a vaginoplasty made
out of a piece of my skin, and I'm in, I'm a woman, right?
It's like, well, no, because women are not just, it's an ass, right?
I mean, there's more to it than that.
For decades, Michael Shermer has been one of the most popular and provocative explicators
of science to popular audiences, having authored bestselling books such as Why People Believe
Weird Things, Why Darwin Matters, The Moral Ark, and The Mind of the Market.
He founded Skeptic Magazine in 1992, hosts a video podcast with leading activists and
intellectuals, and for nearly 20 years authored a widely read column for Scientific American
in which he debunked beliefs in UFOs and other paranormal phenomena, explained the rise of
the new atheism, and showed how evolution systematically informs human behavior.
Shermer's work is deeply and explicitly rooted in libertarian and enlightenment ideas
about individual responsibility, free market economics, rationality,
and the search for something approaching objective truth.
In 2019, Scientific American cut him loose, a move he ascribes to the publication suffocating
embrace of the sort of identity politics and wokeness that he says dominates academic circles
and increasingly the culture at large.
Les Falle Shermer, who holds a PhD in the history of science and teaches Skepticism 101 at Chapman
University, started a weekly sub-stack where he hosts podcasts and the columns he would have written
for Scientific American. The 67-year-old former competitive cyclist talked with Reason during
Freedom Fest in annual gathering in Las Vegas about the fundamental clash between wokeness
and scientific inquiry, how hard it is to overcome the cognitive biases we all have,
why he thinks trans athletes should be banned from most women's sports, why we have so much
trouble acknowledging moral and technological progress, and why he now identifies as a classical
liberal rather than as a libertarian.
Michael Shermer, thanks for talking to Reason.
Nice to see you again.
So you last year, last fall, you started a sub-stack publication to go along with Skeptic
magazine and whatnot, and one of the early pieces was titled Scientific American Goes Woke,
and you were a longtime columnist for Scientific American, a very popular science communicator.
What, describe what you wrote about in Scientific American Goes Woke and why you
started a sub-stack. Right, so I started Scientific American 2001, and I went almost 18 years,
214 consecutive monthly columns. I was going for Steve Gold's 300 that he did in Natural History
Magazine, which would have taken me to April 2025, so I didn't quite make that. They terminated the
column. There was no particular reason given other than, well, we're going different ways, and
it's time for a change. They didn't say, hey, we've gone woke and you're an old non-woke guy.
But I could kind of see the writing on the wall. Last couple columns I had written
were dealing with some issues kind of related to race and sex and gender and that sort of thing,
and I could feel the uncomfortableness in the editorial process, and then boom, they let it go.
So I mean, I don't know for sure, but that was it. So I started the sub-stack just because
I still had more writing than me. I like writing the columns, but this gives me a little more
flexibility if I want to go more than 700 words, like nope more. And also the new media, I try to
keep up with, I have a podcast and what all the kids are doing these days. It's hard to know what's
the right path to take, but it seemed like the sub-stack thing was a way to go. The finances
for it are channeled through the Skeptic Society, which is kind of my day job. So the first one,
Scientific American Goes Woke, I recounted my own experiences, but also I went through a bunch
of articles they had published recently that were clearly what most people would identify as sort of
far-left, woke-progressive politics. And one of the most notorious or discussed pieces had to do
with E.O. Wilson being a racist, right? Being a scientific racist. He's the, he wrote the book
Sociobiology. He, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, his vision of taking evolution and seriously
applying it or trying to apply to human society and whatnot had always been a fraught project,
right? I mean, he was getting pictures of Waterport over him in the 70s at conferences.
Yeah. But that, could you talk a little bit about that?
Yeah, that was one of them.
Because when you wrote about that.
Yeah, in fact, they published this right after he died. So, you know, the body's not even cold
yet. And already he's being accused of being a, you know, kind of race realist, race science,
racist, implied racist, that kind of thing, even though he's not. So one of my other sub-stacks
was a long piece, kind of dissecting the claims against Wilson Cho, that they're absolutely
false. But the worst thing about the Scientific American piece on him was that they provided
no evidence at all. No quotes from him, you know, saying something about the race,
racial differences in IQ, nothing like that. And in fact, there's tons of quotes from him
that I included in my piece where he's like, this can absolutely not be considered evidence of
racial differences between groups. And, you know, and this is no justification for discrimination
of any kind. You know, I abhor the, you know, kind of the old race science stuff. I mean,
he made it clear he doesn't go into any of it. So that was disturbing. They had another one on
how mathematics has gone, has kind of gone racist and bigoted and, I don't know, misogynistic.
And their evidence for this is that there are more male math professors than female math
professors, which is not, I mean, the explanation for that could be that, well, all these old guys
are just race misogynists against women. But there are other hypotheses, and you would think a
scientific publication would say, okay, here are the three explanations for why there is an asymmetry
in the number of professors who are male versus female, right? So you have, well, maybe that
they're just a bunch of misogynists, okay, maybe, maybe there's a pipeline issue, right, that,
that, you know, decades ago, young girls went different pathways than young boys and fewer of
them ended up in STEM fields, so that by the time you get to now where they're being hired,
there's just few of them to select for, because every professor I know is uber liberal, and they're
all dying to hire more women in STEM fields. So it's not like behind closed doors, they're going,
hey, you know, I know we said this publicly, but, you know, we just want to hire more white guys.
They're not doing that, right? So, you know, what are some other hypotheses here? You know,
the evolutionary psych one is, well, there may be an interest difference that, you know,
men migrate boys, migrate toward toys and things and stuff. Women girls migrate more toward
people. And so that, that kind of sorts out later, decades later into the kind of profession
you prefer to go into. So women tend to migrate more toward, you know, medical degrees and biology
and psychology, social science, men more in the STEM fields. Now, which of those is the right
hypothesis? Let's just set that aside. Why can't a scientific publication even say here are the
three hypotheses? Let's look at the evidence. Scientific American is either the oldest or
one of the very oldest continuously published magazines in the world, certainly in the US.
You know, and it went through phases in the 19th century where it's like, okay, yeah, it's talking
about scientific racism, other times it's super liberal, etc. What do you think is driving the
publication or, and the broader, I don't know, you know, kind of popular science community towards
wokeism or, you know, a lot of attention to identity politics where that becomes a controlling kind
of idea apart from anything that they're actually discussing. It's definitely new and it's really
just in the last five years. I think it coincides with the general trend in culture in general of
moving more in that direction. As younger people get those jobs and kind of moving up the demographic
scale, they're getting more and more powerful jobs to direct things the way they want. They came of
age, you know, when those subjects were really important. Now, there's not much any one of us
can do like about the George Floyd incident or this thing or that thing that we see on the news
constantly. But I can do something. I can say, well, look, I'm not a police chief. I'm not a mayor,
but I'm an editor. So I can kind of tilt the editorial decisions more toward the kinds of
political directions we want to take the country. And I'm doing my little share. And I think it
makes people feel like I'm doing something, right? Like, again, you know, what can I do about the
George Floyd thing or police violence or whatever, nothing, but I can go down in March, right? I'm
going down there this afternoon, and I'm going to carry my life. It makes me feel like I'm doing
something because, you know, humans are very moral or moralistic. We like to moralize about
things and express our outrage. That kind of protest does have effect, right? Yes, it can. Right,
absolutely. You mentioned earlier on, you know, kind of being of an older vintage. We're a similar
vintage. How old are you? I'm 67. Okay. So is part of this just like, you know, when we call it
wokeism, you know, 20 years ago, we would have called it political correctness. I think our
parents were, you know, we disappointed them or we defined ourselves against them is part of the
woke conversation. It's just generational warfare that is to be expected. And if not tolerated,
like, you know, of course, right? I mean, this is a way, you know, and I hate to say it in this
crude a term, but like, so you're a guy, you're an old guy, you've been at on the
massive of Scientific American for 20 years. And it's like, we, you know, you're not retiring,
you're, you're probably in better health than you were 10 years ago. And it looks like you're
going to live forever. Like, how the fuck do we get rid of you? Right. So yeah, have we become
our parents? There may be a little bit of that just kind of generational shifts. But, but, but
that doesn't really matter. The question is, what's the right thing to do? What's the truth?
What's the direction we want to take the country? And what do we really know about
this subject or that subject, right? So, I mean, if I may, I mean, you have in one of the
sub stack columns, a fantastic piece where you say you're raising data is to figure out what is
right, not to be right. That's a powerful statement. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit?
Yes, well, because, because I study belief systems for a living and I'm aware of all the
cognitive biases, I can see them in myself. And so to avoid that, you just have to kind of focus on,
instead of looking for evidence confirmation bias to support what I already believe,
got to look for the counter evidence, you know, what, what are the arguments against the, the
beliefs I hold, like this issue on abortion, I'm hardcore pro choice, but I purposely solicited
a pro life argument and said, please give me like the 10 best arguments you have. I want to hear
them, right? Because I don't really know what they are, because I don't pay attention to that
closely, right? So we ended up doing that, that you have to do in general. And is, are you,
is woke ism, for lack of a better term, but our identity politics, is it, are you worried about
it? Not because, you know, you lose your scientific American column as much as this means we're not
focused on trying to figure out what is right, what is true, what is correct, but rather we're
kind of trying to create a narrative and maintain things that may or may not be true.
Yeah, the word woke is pretty loaded now, and it's changed already. I heard John McWhorter
talking about this, the linguist, you know, it used to be a cold term. I mean, you and I would
have been woke, probably in the 90s, because we were libertarian in favor of individual freedom,
rights or whatever. And now that word is means something completely different. So,
but in general, and I don't want to pick on scientific American, I like the people I work
with there and so forth. It's happening across the board, Twitter is mostly run by, you know,
these kind of war progressives and, you know, most science and nature, the two most prominent
publications are running articles about this, you know, the and the Lancet had that cover story of,
you know, we have long medicine is long neglected. What was it people who give birth, right? And I
like, if only we had a word for this, right, that kind of thing. So, you know, the line, but there
is a truth. I mean, like beyond the language terminology, it is true that like women, you
know, women who give birth were often times a medical discourse were kind of seen as like
bystanders. Well, yes. Right. So there is a sociology here that's worth kind of rehearsing
and understanding and unpacking. Well, and I think that the second wave feminists I've talked to,
like Helen Joyce, Carol Tavers, they're very just worried about the kind of woke
gender identity movement because it's reducing women to just body parts. Like a guy can say,
well, if I just get breast implants and I can have a vaginoplasty made out of a piece of my skin,
and I'm in, I'm a woman, right? It's like, well, no, because women are not just
tits and ass, right? I mean, there's more to it than that. A lot more. That's a very 70s woke
analysis. You know, women are more than tits and ass. Yes. That's like very progressive.
Before we talk about, I want to talk about trans issues and abortion and gun control and a couple
of other things. As you've written, you know, your sub stack is absolutely one of, like my
must reads. I appreciate it because I didn't have a subscription to Scientific American and I didn't
always go there and you can go long. And I also want to talk about you have a great piece about
independent media and why that's important, especially in today's kind of cancel culture
world. But before we get there, and this goes to that question of you want to be right, you want
to find out what is right, but not be right. You started out, you're, you used to call yourself
a libertarian. And now you say, I'm not a libertarian anymore. I'm a classical liberal. And
just as a kind of framing device, how, how does that relate? What does that mean? And how is that
related to your interest in finding out what is right, not being right? Yeah, well, the language
doesn't matter. And the word libertarian has gotten a lot of baggage over the past quarter
century or so. I mean, here we are at Freedom Fest, there's quite a wide range of people and
they believe rather different things. But to the general public is like, oh, those are those people
that the preppers that want to think the world's going to end, got to get Bitcoin and gold and
guns. And, you know, it's like, well, I'm not really one of those, right? And, you know, and also,
you know, when you called yourself a libertarian, what, what did libertarianism do? I think more of
a kind of an iron rand, you know, just everybody just be self reliance, be self responsible.
I guess the core would be the individual as the fundamental unit of society and their autonomy
and liberty to make the choices they want. Right. So this is my concern about conservatives.
They, they say that, you know, we believe in liberty and autonomy and so, but they don't,
you know, they very much care at what consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedrooms because
they think it's going to leak out and cause the moral corruption of the family and then the community
and then the society and then the nation. And, and I think that's the wrong focus because that's
kind of a collectivist argument, right? The nation is over the society. Well, it is true. I think it
was Rick Santorum and Bill O'Reilly at various points talked about how you have gay marriage and then
the next thing, you know, men are marrying ducks and obviously we're all engaged to waterfowl,
right? So they're not, so how, why does classical liberal like, why do you think that's a better
descriptor for you? I guess I like the word. I don't know. It has sort of a gravitas to it. I like it.
And it, by the way historians talk about the founding fathers and though they were classical
liberals and you kind of look back and know, yeah, I agree with that. I like that. Yeah.
Just as a kind of a, well, a fuzzy set, as I call it, or a family resemblance of a concept,
a schema that allows us to capture a bunch of stuff without firm borders where, you know,
we can overlap and we're both this, but you believe that and I believe that and that's okay.
And you have a wonderful column about the Kardashian. You use family, you know, a Vick and
Steenian family resemblance concept and you use the Kardashians, which is kind of a great way to
think about it because there is something, I don't want to say essential, but there is kind of
something essential to being a Kardashian, even if you don't have the same parents or the same
genetics, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly. Right. So classical liberal for you that, you know,
that kind of fuzzy set or family resemblance. Right. And for libertarian, you think over the
past 25 years, it's become too kind of prepper, too extreme. It's a little too, yeah, a little
fringy, but also a little hyper focused on the individual. It's not like we should be free to
do absolutely anything anytime we want. Of course, that's not true. You can't drive on the right side
of the road or the left side of the road on any given day. However, you feel that day, right? We
give up our freedoms all the time. And, you know, the, if you read the Federalist papers,
that is what they talk about all the time. We want to give people freedom. But, you know,
of course, we have to have this and that. We need a standing arm. So do you think the libertarian
has become synonymous with anarchism? Well, that's an old mistake people used to make.
And sometimes you have to correct that. No, I think it's more affiliated with like,
you know, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, I don't know, the kind of Second Amendment fundamentalist,
you know, the gun nutters. So we're going to talk about gun nuts. Preppers fit into that. And also
Christians, right? Evangelical Christians. Ron Paul and Rand Paul are Baptist.
The libertarians are kind of over all over the map on religiosity, right? Yeah. I mean,
you guys have done surveys on this. Some of them are religious, but others are not.
Yeah. No, and you have on the one hand, you have people like on Rand, and then you have people
like Ron Paul. And, you know, certainly over the past 20 years, Ron Paul is probably the
single biggest factor when people say, I become libertarian. It's because they've encountered
Ron Paul. So he's a huge, you know, tributary into libertarian, the libertarian movement.
And do you think, you know, if you're, if you're kind of an evangelical Christian,
can you be, obviously, everybody can call themselves libertarian, but are you, could
you be in that family of people who, so what is the, kind of what's the, what's the litmus
has, or what's the Maginot line there where you're like, okay, I can't do this. I would say
consistency of principles across different issues. And I'm more critical of conservatives
than libertarians on that for sure. But like when, when DeSantis sick the government on
Disney, now I'm not crazy about Disney's woke progressive politics, and we're going to
introduce these characters into our cartoons. Okay, well, you know, but, but the libertarian way
of dealing with that, or what should have been the old conservative way of dealing with that is,
well, I'm just not going to go to the end and give my money to Disney. I won't go to their
films. I won't go to their parks and so on. But DeSantis is like, no, the conservative thing
to do is we're going to slap them with, you know, with higher taxes and regulations. It's like,
when did that become a conservative thing? Right. So I, and I do think libertarians are,
okay, where's the consistency say for foreign policy, you know, don't we have a moral obligation
to help people that are under the suppression of civil liberties around the world? You know,
sometimes we do sometimes. Where's the balance there? I don't know. I guess as a fuzzy set,
I would say classical liberalism and libertarianism, they're either in the same or they're too
very overlapping set. No, and you're not alone in this. And I'm curious, you know,
Penn Gillette, obviously famously also kind of voice similar misgivings. And it's interesting
when high profile libertarians like yourself starts to say, you know what, I don't know,
I kind of want to be in a different club. And again, I wonder if part of it is generational.
I mean, because when you say, you know, kind of like second amendment people,
do you feel like the movement is more focused on gun rights now than it was in 1990?
Now it is, yes, because of all the mass public shootings and the government response to this.
And that drives up gun sales. You know, ironically, Obama probably did more for gun sales than anybody.
Even though he actually never did much. Right. No, he actually in his first term, he allowed
people to carry weapons on Amtrak at a national park. So he actually was liberalizing.
People certainly fundraised against the idea that he was a gun grabber. Well, we've seen this kind
of consistency, my body, my choice in the two different issues of abortion and vaccines. And
each side is like, you know, pretty hypocritical about this. Do you feel with COVID? Is that also
a place where, you know, libertarian, libertarian skepticism towards state power is one thing.
And then, you know, but you also want good science and good public policy. And then there was a lot
within the libertarian movement, I think there was a lot of not simply being anti vaccine mandates,
but being anti vaccine. See here, I would say the libertarian position would be, I don't like
mandates. And yeah, okay, that's just the principle government forcing you to do something.
But on the other hand, to say, well, but if the vaccines really work, and the CDC and
how to you're saying we should all get them, if I go along with that, then the next step is going
to be the mandates. And I don't want that. So I'm going to be skeptical of the science. Right.
No, no, no. Yeah, it's okay to just say, look, we should all do this. And by the way,
most of us really should get vaccinated. They work. And there is within your conception of
libertarianism, there is a public, I mean, you're not an anarchist, you believe the state has
legitimacy in certain roles. And that there are, and you know, I would argue, maybe COVID is not
that case, but that if there is a communicable disease, and there is a vaccine that prevents
me from giving it to you, whether you ask for it or not, there's a role for the state to say,
now you have to get manned, you have to get vaccinated. In the same way, you have to pay taxes.
Well, now you're really at the same level. We need a standing army, we need a police force,
and, you know, and so forth to protect our freedoms and our property rights and so on. How
are you going to do that? And if you say, well, I don't, I'm not participating. I'm not paying
taxes. You didn't sign that social contract. So you'll free ride. So you would say, you did not,
you did not change libertarianism, maybe or something like that. Well, let's, let's talk
about your abortion pieces, because this is also something I'm, so I'm 50, I'm about to turn 59,
and when I joined Reason in 93, and I had grown up reading Reason. So I, and that's how I became
libertarian. And I would say everybody I knew who was a libertarian basically said either they were
pro-choice, affirmatively, that abortion, at least through a certain point in pregnancy,
was a woman's right, and it was nobody's business, and that it was not a morally
bad issue. It might be morally complicated. And that even people who were pro-life would say,
you know, this is not something the state should be involved in. That no longer seems to be the
case among libertarians. And even though it still seems to be the case in the public at large,
only about 20% according to Gallup or against abortion under all circumstances,
that's been very consistent since Roe was decided. It's religion. Yes. I mean, Reagan was pro-choice
until, as I understand it, Jerry Bowell sat him down and said, I can deliver you millions of votes,
but you got to get religion. I'm not sure if that's, I mean, he definitely signed a, you know,
a very liberal law in California as governor, and then at various points recanted. And I'm not sure
of the motivation for that. But, you know, what you, you say, and I found this really
fascinating because you said I am pro-choice and you started out definitely very, you know,
pro-abortion basically through the term of pregnancy. And now you are still pro-choice,
but it's more complicated. Can you, can you make the case for, you know, why abortion should be
allowed? Okay. Well, first of all, I'll give a nod to the pro-lifers that it is a human life
that's developing. You know, from the day one, it's a potential human life. It's not a legal person
and so forth. And so, you know, here is what Richard Duckins calls the tyranny of the discontinuous
mind. If you, if you're stuck in black and white on or off, it's only two sides. There's no continuum.
You're going to get very confused in your thinking about these kinds of issues, right? So you have
to draw the line somewhere. You know, why is, why is a 17 year old not allowed to whatever vote or
something that an 18 year old can on the next day? Okay. Well, it's just because the law has to draw
the line somewhere. Science doesn't have that kind of demarcation, right? So we do those kinds of
things all the time. And so I'm willing to say you're right. It's a life. But the female, the
mother is also a life and it's also a legal person and far more advanced than the two-day-old fetus
or the three-month-old fetus or whatever. So, you know, as Thomas Sowell says, there are no solutions.
There's just compromises. And when you have conflicting rights, something has to give like
the trans athletes, you know, women's rights, trans rights that conflict when men want to
compete in women's divisions. Something has to go. You can't have both. So we just have to make a
decision. Whose right should we favor in this case? So in that case, I said, well, the adult woman
should be given the nod. Just in principle, you know, individual autonomy and liberty and control
over your own body. That's fundamental. Even while saying, but don't put yourself in that
position where you have to make that choice. It's not a good choice to have to make. You know,
it happens. So, okay, we should be your choice to do it if you want to. But, you know, as I tell my
students, you know, two words, birth control. Right. Just be prepared. Are you satisfied with
the, you know, or not satisfied, but how do you feel about the Dobbs decision, which gets rid of
the right of abortion at the national level? So now you had invoked the Federalist Papers,
and just thinking about federalism, and now we have 50 states that are laboratories of
democracy. Sounds good in principle. Right. But because I know a lot of pro-lifers, and they're
all pretty much evangelical Christians. And, you know, overturning row is just the first step.
They want to abandon every state. They will chase people down to the bitter end to get them to
stop having abortions under any conditions. And that scares me. Do you worry that on the flip
side of that, that, you know, some states are now going, that are pro-life or pro-choice are going to,
you know, where they might have had regulation of abortion in, you know, the after viability or,
you know, later in the pregnancy are going to be like, okay, as a response to, you know,
if we're California and we're neighboring a state that is getting rid of all, you know,
life begins at the moment of conception, we're going to say abortion is allowed until the moment
of birth. Yeah. Right. So there's extremists on both sides. The pro-choicers that say,
should be okay to abort your fetus the day before you're supposed to give birth. Of course, that's
wrong. You know, and again, you get away from the binary thinking, and then you can see a spectrum.
Yeah. Okay. So let's just draw the line, I don't know, three months in Germany is three months,
maybe four months. Right. Yeah. And then, okay, so that's like the age 17 to 18. Okay, there,
right there, that's the time. Do you feel like we, I mean, and this is interesting when you're
talking about kind of gradient thinking or, you know, things on a continuum, that to me,
and we've talked about postmodernism versus, you know, kind of modernism or whatever in the past,
but it's, you know, in the 21st century, it seems like on certain levels, we're much more
comfortable with gradients and a kind of range of options. And we realize that things are kind of
continuous. It's not, even though this is the digital age, it's not, you know, black and white,
it's not one in zero, right? Right. But on other levels, we seem to be, you know, I mean, and the
abortion question is, you know, seems to be front and center on this. It's like, no, it is either
murder at all stages or it is not. And that just seems like a terrible way to kind of be engaging
reality. Exactly. Right. And again, on the consistency issue, if, you know, if conservatives are
really pro-life, you know, they don't seem to be very pro-life after you're born, right? This is
George Carlin's riff. Right. You know, after that, you're on your own, you know. Now, of course,
Christians, well, because he does that riff about, you know, no preschool support, no school lunches,
no help for single moms and on and on and on. Of course, the conservatives will say, no, no, no,
it's, we just don't want the government providing those. That's the job of religion or whatever.
And then he throws in the little line, until you become military age, and then we're interested
in you again. Yeah. Okay. So there's some truth to that humor, right? Right. And so again, that
consistency, you know, if you really cared. Why is consistency so important to you? And I mean,
this is true of libertarians, right? You know, post, even, you know, laps libertarians or whatever,
like, you know, and when I talk to most people, like, I'm always like, well, I got, you know,
is this logical? Does it make sense? Does it work all the way through? Most people are like,
I don't give a shit. Like this is what I believe here. This is what I believe here,
and they don't have to be consistent. Yeah. Well, because if you have a principle that's
based on some factual basis, that it should be applied consistently as consistently as possible
with the recognition, there may be a few exceptions here and there. But that's the whole point of
having a principle is that you apply it evenly across the board, right? And so again, I just think,
you know, people are inconsistent about that. For obvious reasons, you know, I just want what's good
for me and my tribe. Yeah. And, you know, it's like, it's like the issue over that the private
prayer that the high school football coach gave 50 yards. The private prayer on the 50 on the 50
yard line with the players around him. And he's a Christian. Okay. And of course, Christian is going,
yes, this is great. You know, the Supreme Court voted in his favor. Yeah. Well, what if he was down
there saying Alou Akbar? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We're not going to allow that. Oh, okay.
Well, what's the principle here? Yeah, thankfully, as this is what Satanists exist for, they're
already filing to do satanic prayers on the 50 yard line. And, you know, this also like takes us
away from the question of like, okay, well, it's football, like why are high schools playing football?
I don't know, you know, like I was a taxpayer, I'm kind of like, they can't even teach our kids
to read them now. They're giving them brain damage or whatever. That's a separate issue.
Well, let's, let's talk about trans athletes and what is a woman. You wrote most recently,
you looked at Matt Walsh's documentary, What is a Woman? And, you know, he is a right wing troll.
He, you know, wants to make fun of feminists, he wants to make fun of gender activists and
things like that. But the documentary you found pretty compelling and interesting. Can you talk
a bit about that? I was expecting something of a Borat, like send up or a Milo Yiannopoulos kind
of troll. And it wasn't that bad. I've seen him elsewhere. And yes, he's definitely in the kind
of that Ben Shapiro classical conservative issues. And I disagree with him on most of his beliefs.
But I, but what made the film powerful is he's not saying the things that are crazy,
that's the people he's interviewing. And it's not like he, like Borat, he gets a couple guys drunk
and they start yammering away about the blacks and the Jews or whatever. Here's the underbelly
of America. He's not doing anything like that. He's going to the, you know, here's a professor of
gender studies. You know, what is a woman? It's right there in your title, Gender Women Studies.
You know, what is a woman? This guy can't answer the question. Okay. So what, what's going on here?
I mean, these are smart people. So the problem here I think is we're back to the postmodernism.
Like I learned from you that, you know, the original postmodernism was really good. It's
kind of a form of skepticism. Let's challenge the mainstream dogmas back in the 40s and 50s.
Yeah, that's good. Right. And then it kind of just run, run, run a muck and goes too far. And I think
that's what's happened here where, and then this particular professor said, you're just trying to
tag me with an essentialist definition of gender. It's like, yeah, that's right. Because to have
a fuzzy set or a family resemblance, you need some agreed upon words that we're going to use
of characteristics that define this thing. And that's the essence of, you know, so it's the gametes,
right? Biologists say, well, a woman and a man is defined by their gametes. You either making
sperm or you're making eggs. That's it. And everything else follows from that. And if you
look under the hood, there's a thousand different differences in the body that go toward sperm
production and development and so on, or egg production and development of the fetus and whatnot.
And it's not just whatever my inner feelings are. And that would be, you know, kind of the most
extreme of postmodernism, whatever I feel is the truth. It's my truth. And that's essentially what
Walsh's film shows that these people have gone that far. Whatever it is you say it is, that's what
it is. And why do you think the trans issue, you've also written about how, you know, when these
pulverized alts came out, I guess earlier this year, it was kind of stunning that
if you look at older, you know, the silent generation, the percentage of people who identify
as LGBT, so lesbian, gay, bi and trans, very flat, baby boomers flat, Gen X flat, millennials picks
up a little bit. And then Gen Z, people are basically about under like 25. It is, you know,
10% of the population now says that they are LGBT up from like half of that in 2017.
What's going on with the, you know, with an interest in trans being trans? Do you think
it is that people are there are more trans people now? Or is this all kind of a rhetorical
gesture? And how do you deal with this? Yeah, well, we don't know for sure, because it's so new.
What is the normal background rate of gender dysphoria, where you feel like from a very young
age that you were born in the wrong body. Now, before recently, it was like maybe one tenth of
one percent or, or even less a 20th of one percent, just vanishingly small. And now all of a sudden,
you have, you know, these spikes of like 4,000% increase in this one age core, like age 14 to 19,
you know, that kind of thing. And so that would suggest the social contagion hypothesis that
is it spreads amongst a community of people that are either in the same classroom in school or
they're on an online community. And they get a lot of social proof and positive feedback if they
say I'm this, you know, buy a pan on whatever. And I had a student a couple of two years ago,
who in the middle of class, this was a small seminar, so we talked a lot. And she said,
I've decided I'm a boy, this is what I feel like I'm going to be a man. And she changed her name,
and everybody called her the name, including me, cut her hair, change her clothes and so on. And,
and then, but in the conversations that ensued, it was clear to me, she doesn't want to be a man,
she wants to be trans. That's the thing to be. And the moment you announce that, it's like,
oh my God, what's that? And, you know, a thousand questions from the other students. And it's like,
I see. So now the other hypothesis is that societies become more liberal, tolerant, open,
so more people are coming out. Right. Now that is true with, with, I think, gays and lesbians,
although now we're having a backlash, say, some lesbians and gays that, you know, where are all
the lesbians now? And their concern, and I agree this is a concern, is that what if you're a 13,
14 year old young man or young boy, and you find yourself attracted to other boys, and somebody
tells you that's because inside you're a girl, you're not actually gay. When in fact, this person
is most likely going to grow up to be gay, which is now okay. That's accepted, right? Now, another
thing I've been thinking about is, is it that because the LGBTQ, the gay marriage, same sex
marriage thing happened so fast from 2011, when the majority of Americans finally tipped over to
above 50% in support to 2015, the Supreme Court decision to make it the law of the land. That
was pretty fast. That's probably the fastest rights revolution ever. So it could be the next,
you know, sort of cohorts, like, well, what are we going to champion? You know, what's next? You
know, there's animal rights, but there's gender rights. And so LGBTQ is one thing. So the focus
has primarily been about who you are attracted to. And that used to be against the law. You can't
be attracted to the same sex people. You can't have sex with it. That was illegal. People were
fired in the government. Thousands were fired for that. And now that's okay. So they've kind of
shifted it to okay, what about who you identify as a man or woman? That's kind of become maybe the
next rights revolution. And people, again, they want to be engaged in something that's meaningful
in life. There's a next rights revolution there. And I'm going to go for that.
In, you know, when we were younger, and I'm thinking in the 70s and whatnot, being trans,
and it was back then, it was short for transsexual. And it always implied surgical, like gender
reassignment surgery. And I'm thinking of people like the tennis player, Renee Richards, who had
been Richard Raskin, I believe, who joined the ladies professional tennis tour. But it was very
much about, you know, physicality. I mean, obviously, there were hormone treatments and
things like that. But it was like, if you were a man and you wanted to become a woman, you
got the surgery, and that's what defined it. And you were saying before that like the equipment
isn't necessarily the definition of being male or female. Today's trans, it seems to be much
more about performing a kind of almost public sexuality. How does that, yeah, how does that
factor into any of this? Well, again, I think that supports the social contagion hypothesis.
The whole point of doing it is to make it public. Or else, why would you do it? Whereas before, it
was, you know, a private thing, except for the public figures like Renee Richards. You know,
this is just something you do because that's what you need to do. And, you know, our mutual
friend, Deirdre McCluskey, you know, was Donald McCluskey and transitioned to great cost to her
personal life. This wasn't like she was getting love bombed by everybody, quite the contrary,
and did it anyway, and still does it because that's who she is. Okay, that exists. That's a real thing.
But is it true that, I mean, I've been hearing stories and reading accounts, you know, like
half the class or a quarter of the class of a high school class says, I'm trans or bi or pan or
there's something. So it also looks like being cisgender straight is about the
boringest thing you could be. And you don't want to be that.
And actually, a number of gay and lesbian friends of mine, you know, they like gay men, white gay men
feel like they are even more square than heterosexuals, because heterosexuals are talking
about kinks and poly and stuff like that. And lesbians, yeah, they're, you know, because lesbians
have always been a smaller percentage of the population. And I know people like Abigail
Schreyer, who I've talked to, I know you have, who's quite controversial in a lot of things,
but she argues that particularly girls who would grow up to be lesbian, their parents, I mean,
this is kind of a complicated argument, but I kind of buy into it that their parents are actually
almost homophobic, and they would rather that their child be trans than to be lesbian, which
seems, I mean, I guess what I'm asking you is, I mean, you have witnessed and participated in like
this vast kind of rights revolution over the past 50 years where society is so much more profoundly
libertarian than we could have imagined, you know, in the bicentennial, you know, and I picked that
not because of bi, but it's just because it's like 76, right? But it's like, you can, you know,
you can be gay, you can be straight, you can be anything, and it does not seem to be an impediment
to any kind of social success, any kind of professional success. Yeah, so that's progress,
right? It really is. Yeah, right. But you know, just from a scientist's perspective,
what is the real number? Yeah. And we don't know. But I suspect that the current numbers we're seeing
now are greatly exaggerated. I mean, back when the Kinsey report came out, you know, he reported
10% of the guys were gay. Right. And I mean, which in a study that was clearly poorly designed,
right? Or kind of like cooked data in a lot of ways. Yeah. I mean, the real number is probably
something like three to 5%. And then it's also curious to know what, why are there not as many
lesbians? It looks like maybe how many lesbians are is like half of how many gay guys are. Why is
that? You know, that there could be some social aspects. This is kind of a bizarre question,
but we are at freedom fest, so we can talk about whatever we want. But how much of sexual orientation
do you think is kind of baked in, you know, when you come out of the womb, you know, and how much of
it is susceptible to kind of social influence? Well, I think most of it's baked in biologically,
genetically, you know, in the womb, chemistry, and so on. After that, of course, it could be
tweaked a little bit. But, you know, the vast majority of people that identify, you know, are
cisgender, also cisgender. And yes, society could, you know, the whole blue and pink thing,
that used to be reversed like a century and a half ago. I forget maybe like 1890s or something,
you know, the blue and pink thing was different than it is now. And by that, you mean pink was
associated with men and blue was, you know. I forget why that was, but in any case,
but it's not like the colors of the toys are going to make the little boy more masculine.
We've all seen the pictures of Hammingway in a dress as a kid, and it's like his late
and homosexuality had nothing to do with the way he was raised, right, or something.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I do think the born this way, I think the other interesting thing about the
current trans movement is that the gay community fought for decades for a kind of biological
determinism. I was born this way. It's not a lifestyle choice. Your little reparative
programs are not going to work, you can't de-convert me. If I just had the right woman,
then I would know, you know, how to be straight or anything like that.
So, and the reason for that also is that if you're born that way, then you're a protected
class, your rights stand. But now the trans movement seems to be saying, you could be anything you
want, anytime you want, you can change from day to day, you can change genders, you know, you can
change who you're attracted to. It's totally fluid. And that's actually scary for gays,
because it's like, well, hang on, now we're going to get pushed back from the conservatives,
they're going to go, oh, so you are not that born that way. In that case, we can fix you.
And all of this exists when we're talking about rights or the individual's relationship to government
or something is totally separate. Like so, I mean, because regardless of why people are trans or
identify as trans or gay or straight or whatever, that doesn't imply the government should discriminate
against them in any way, shape, or form. Yeah, of course, right. Trans rights are human rights,
absolutely. You should not be fired for being trans. I mean, if that's the only reason, then
no, for the same reason, gays shouldn't have been fired decades ago.
With trans athletes, you've written about this. And on a certain level, and particularly at the
highest levels possible, when we're talking about Olympic athletes or NCAA athletes or
something, it's such a small number of people. It almost seems wrong to be looking at that and
then kind of generalizing backwards, because by definition, these people are extreme outliers
in performance and everything. But what is your sense of what is fair for trans athletes
competing against biological male or female? Well, so if you're born male and you go through
puberty, there are so many changes that are substantive if you compare to female body
development in puberty. After that's happened, and the international swimming body just made
this decision based on that argument that it's too late. There's no amount of testosterone
suppression you're going to take to even the playing field with the average amount of
testosterone that men have versus women if we could just lower those. After puberty, it's too late.
I mean, all the big changes have been made. The bones are bigger and denser. The sinews and
muscles and ligaments and tendons are all different. The VO2 uptake for your lungs, your oxygen
capacity and on and on and on. There's just like a thousand different differences. Now it's true,
again, there are two overlapping sets. There are some women who are much more physically strong and
so on than some men, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the average,
the two means. Although sometimes they get kicked out of, say, track and field and things like that.
Yes. Well, you know, where people have naturally... These German dopers.
Well, those were dopers, right? But Casper, I'm sorry, I'm blanking on her name now,
the South African runner who's a woman or is always identified as a woman and who's fantastic,
but has elevated levels of testosterone and other things, can't compete internationally unless she
reduces that. Is that fair? I mean, it might be that you need to have some kind of system.
You have to draw the line somewhere, right? On average, there's a pretty vast differences
between average testosterone levels and it's not just testosterone. That's kind of the big one.
But you have two overlapping bell curves. Some of the higher women are going to be higher than
some of the lower men. Then you have to make it so the outliers, well, this woman is right up against
the upper limit and, well, okay. So this is the rule we made. Should we be looking at a world
beyond, like, why do we have male and female sports competitions? Well, because if we didn't,
there'd be no women in sports. You know, I mean, they just wouldn't... You are stepping in it
everywhere. You're like Sideshow Bob hitting rakes everywhere you go. Have you seen the doubles match
in tennis where I think it's Federer and the doll on opposite sides and each of them has a top
woman. I think one of them was the William Sisters and one of the other top ones. And the women can't
even get a racket on the male serve. I mean, they're like diving and rolling on the grass and
they can't even hit it. That's what would happen. There would be no women players at all. That would
be the end of women's sports. That's just the way it is. That's reality. I'm not talking about
chess or something like this, but these physical sports like that. You know, when I was directing
Race Across America in the 90s... Explain what that was, because that's a phenomenal kind of event,
which, yeah, it's worth rehearsing. Yeah, so in 1982, me and three other guys started this race
called Great American Bike Race. Later changed to Race Across America Ram. So this is a non-stop
coast-to-coast race. Each rider, a cyclist, has a support crew that follows them. The clock starts
and stops when you're done. And so you can skip sleep or whatever. This was because it was the
Reagan 80s. We were all worried about nuclear annihilation and we were coped out of our minds.
So we were just going to ride our bikes across America. This is the rise of the Iron Man
Triathlon and the Adida Rod dog sled race. Let's just go crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so by the
night, of course, we had women right away enter the race and we had a women's division and a women's
prize and plaques and rings and all that stuff. But in 1993 and 1994, when I was race director,
I had two women, Shana Hogan and Muffy Ritz, who were better than all of the men for the first
thousand miles, all the way into Colorado. And there was talk like, well, maybe a woman could
win the race, right? And if I recall correctly, I think it was the anthropologist Ashley Montague
at various points in the early 70s hypothesized that women were designed by evolution to be
better ultramarathon than men. It's kind of true in the longer people race,
gender falls apart. It falls, it becomes less important. But if it's, yeah, but not say something
like a high speed race, like a 200 front stage is pretty long, but women wouldn't last, you know,
the first 20 minutes. So what happened? So they're leading up through Colorado and then
what happened? Yeah, what happened? Well, she got caught and then, you know, finished over a day
behind the winning men at the winning two or three men beat her. And it's just strength.
Ultimately, it's just every little bit of difference in the bodies that it just made a
difference over 10, nine days rather than the first three days. So, you know, but I even asked
the women, you know, would you like to just have one division and you compete against them? No,
no, because it's not fair, right? Guys are just on average. So let me go back to something we're
talking about at the start of this. You know, there seems to be a tend to EO Wilson was a,
you know, a conventional liberal, you know, and towards the end of his life, you know, he's very
big on things like climate change and all of that. Like he subscribed to a lot of, you know,
kind of bromides of progressive liberal policy. But within the concept of sociobiology and whatnot,
there does seem to be a real tension on, you know, broadly on the left, where it's like we
can create the world however we want to. Like we believe in evolution because we believe in science
and we are not those rubes in Arkansas, you know, who are Christian, who are biblical, literalists
and reject science. We believe in science. But then, you know, Wilson's theories kind of suggest
that no, like if you take evolution seriously, there are going to be limits on how much you can
engineer humanity. And there are going to be different groups even will select for different
properties and characteristics that are going to have real world outcomes. Is that a tension within
kind of the science community and either the right or the left?
Well, yes. But, but Picker points out in his book, The Blank Slate, that in fact,
the opposite is true, that of course, biology and genetics is part of it. The environment
can't operate on nothing. It has to operate on a physical system, which is the brain,
which is designed by your genes, right, made of proteins. And so it's not possible that it can't
have any effect. And so you have to understand what the effects are before you can reengineer society
to make it fair. You know, Thomas Soule wrote a book about this is the kind of conflicting
worldviews and that is kind of utopian worldview where it's all blank slates and we can reengineer
society to make it perfectly equal. We'll always fail because we're not perfectly equal. You know,
we have different interests, different physical characteristics and skills and so on. Well,
that's just the way it is. So there you need kind of a more general principle that says,
wherever you fall on the bell curve of whatever it is we're measuring,
you should have the opportunity to do whatever it is you want without any barriers based on
these protected classes that you didn't choose, right? Kind of a Rawlsian argument. You don't
know what your running speed is going to be or what your IQ is going to be. So we have to make
it fair that you have access to all the different jobs and the chips fall where they may. Wilson
at the end of his life, maybe the last decade or so, endorsed group selection. A group selection
is more supported by liberals in the left because it's this idea that, you know, we as a group can
be the target of selection and make things happen that the individual can't. Now, most evolutionary
biologists, people like Dawkins and Pinker say, no, this is not true. No evidence for this.
And, you know, it's still the individual genome of the individual is the one that is the target of
natural selection. But I just thought that was interesting toward the ends of his life. It was
a more liberal kind of argument he was making. And I mean, Stephen Jay Gould was, I guess what
I'm getting at is that you science, I mean, people or maybe it's libertarians or scientists
want to believe that I am arguing from science and reality into my politics, but perhaps these
are separate spheres. Not necessarily. I'm willing to, you know, leap over a human's wall,
separating is a not. We do it all the time. I mean, the way things are, we have to structure
society in a way based on human nature. And again, just fairness should be our goal.
Why fairness? Well, again, kind of a Rawlsian argument that you don't know where you're going
to be. So we have to make it as fair as possible. And then you do whatever you want. And we're not
going to have equal outcomes. This is the problem today is that, you know, the drive toward equal
outcomes. No, no, because we're never going to get equal outcomes just for a thousand different
reasons. So just equal opportunities is the goal. But yeah, anyway, so, but yeah, so there is
a tension in people like Gould and Wilson on the left about, well, what about genetics? This is
just a misunderstanding. It says Pinker and I agree with him that, you know, you're just misreading
this thing like it. If it's genetic, you can't change it. No. In fact, that's not true. Right.
Let's talk about gun control because you've written and this is probably one of the issues
where you depart most from a kind of libertarian orthodoxy. But you believe in gun control.
And can you make the briefcase for that? And, you know, why do libertarian or maybe not libertarians,
let's say, second amendment fundamentalists in your phrase, where are they wrong?
Well, so society is filled with collective action problems we need to solve as a group.
And to do that, you have to get, you know, a majority and then they all have to chip in
like paying taxes again. It's just most libertarians are not anarchists and they agree, okay, we need
property rights and therefore we have to have a court system to support your property rights and
we need a police force and the prison system and a military. All of a sudden you have a big
government that you got to fund with taxes. All right, how is this any different? Why is guns
separate? In my opinion, it's because guns are almost totemic as a proxy for something else.
This kind of focus on individual autonomy, freedom, self-defense, liberty, freedom from
the government, that sort of thing. Over and above all the other concessions you've already made,
you know, coming to pay for police and fire and military and so on. And if I don't
pay my taxes, they're coming to get me at some point. I'll get the letters and then, you know,
so forth. But eventually men with guns will come to your house, right? Why, you've signed on for
that, you know, so. But I think that's why they want the guns because then they can fight back.
I know, but yeah, but why would, okay, so yeah, right. So, but why would you support that? Because
you've already agreed that, well, we need somebody to protect our, my property rights
through a court system that I'm willing to pay for. Well, how about the guy over there,
he doesn't want to pay for it. Well, then send men with guns over there and he has guns.
You know, this, this lead in a way, this kind of fanaticism about just arm everybody.
You know, is a way of saying the United States is a failed state. And it's just everybody's
on their own and we don't really trust the police or the military to do their job. We don't trust
our institutions. We give up. It's like we're living in Somalia. Well, no, we're not living in
Somalia. I can see if you live there while you'd want a gun or something. And, and I do get the,
you know, if I, if I'm an African American living in an inner city and I don't trust the police,
because they're not trustworthy and they can't get there in time. I, and there's violence around
me. I should have a gun. Again, not by an area. You know, I'm not anti-gun at all. I grew up with
guns. My stepfather was a hunter. So I had a BB gun and a pellet gun and then a 20-gauge shotgun,
then a 12-gauge shotgun. And for 20 years, I had a handgun in my house in Altadena. And, you know,
but it's just, we're facing a social problem. How do we solve it? The carnage is, you know,
oh, more people die by guns than by cars. And is that, I mean, one of the things that is, is true.
I mean, gun homicides have been going down, you know, since the mid 90s. So there's slight upticks
and things like that. But the suicides, you know, I mean, that's like more than half of gun deaths,
right? So that's part of what your argument is, right? Yeah. Right. So how about just,
how about just regulation in the form of more, better background checks, right? And we already
have laws about, you know, men with restraining orders against their significant other. I mean,
when a woman is murdered, it's, I think it's like 90% of it is by a significant other.
After they broke up or got divorced or child custody issues, something like that.
You know, why have the gun there? If he already has a restraining order, he can't buy a gun.
A lot of those laws are already in place. Just enforce them, you know, the gun show loophole.
Are you sympathetic to the argument that, yeah, I mean, this is the point. We have tons of gun
laws and they don't seem to be, you know, they're in the same way that we, you know, you can't be
utopian about certain things like school shootings are horrible, but they are not the, they're not
common enough where that's where you make all the laws. To be honest, man, I'm ready to give up on
the whole thing and just say, if I get, I mean, it's just, just let everybody have their guns,
because there's already 400 million guns, right? 120 guns for every 100 people. So we're talking
about 400 million guns in America. We're not going to get them back. You know, if the government
said we're doing a buyback or a takeback program, it'd be like Waco every day. Yeah, ruby rich.
It's, it's fascinating to that actually as more guns are in circulation, it's in a fewer percentage
of households, which so fewer people are having, owning more guns. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
particularly, you know, focus on the gun issue, but that seems like an interesting social change.
And I'm not sure what accounts for it, or if that's good or bad or different. Yeah. You know,
in the examples that I use, everybody uses, you know, Austria and Australia, other countries have
done these things and it worked. Yeah, but they're smaller with genius population. They didn't have
very many guns in the first place. They don't have the same culture that we have about guns,
second amendment, all that. I don't know. I don't know how, I don't know what the solution is. It
seems like somebody should do something and I know how libertarians respond to that. Yeah,
the government, we don't want the government to do more. It's already doing too much.
Okay. But again, like back to the analogy with cars, pretty much everybody signed off in the
idea, well, cars should be regulated. You know, seatbelts are good and airbags are good. And you
know, that even though the number of car deaths still hovers like 35 to 40,000 a year, but if
you adjust it by the miles driven, cars are much safer now than they used to be. And why is that
government regulation? You have to have seatbelts. You're speaking heresy now. I know. I know. That
government can never do anything good. I don't think, I don't see how that would have happened
just by private enterprise. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I mean, that's a, it's a serious challenge to
that kind of knee-jerk libertarianism, which I think, you know, people who still call themselves
libertarians like myself, I need to take up that mantle and sometimes I can and sometimes I can't.
Right. Yeah. I mean, but just one last point, a collective action problem like the motorcycle
helmet thing, you know, and back when that happened, you know, libertarians, a lot of motorcycle,
I'm not going to do it. Right. Or they would wear these, you know, little nothing helmets.
You know, I get that. Yeah. I totally get that. But, you know, the way our medical
system operates, eventually, you know, you and I already have to pay for these accidents and
these head injuries. Do you, I'm assuming you grew up riding bicycles without helmets.
When did you start when you were a bike racer? Yes. Well, that happened in the
accident. But are they effective? Yes. The current helmets are totally effective. Yes.
Because they're designed based on motorcycle helmet design. It's a compressed polystyrene
shell that on impact, it absorbs like 95% of the impact. And they work. The bike helmets before
that. These are the old leather strap ones. Yeah. At the Den Show when I worked at the bike show,
when I worked for Bell Helmets, they were one of my sponsors. We used to take one of those
leather hairnets and have the people come by, okay, put your fist inside there. Yeah. Now,
slam it against that brick wall. Yeah. No, I'm not. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Now, do it with
one of these helmets. No problem. Right. It's like, that's your head, right? But was that,
you know, was that innovation driven by superior technology and information or was it by mandate?
This is, well, by mandate because enough people were died in the Tour de France
from head injuries that the tour itself said, hey, we need to mandate helmets. So, and when I was
working for Bell at the time, they were saying, they already had the Bell shell, which was this
white geeky looking helmet. And they've had this for like 15 years. No one was buying it. No one
serious cyclists would not wear it. So I said, you need to design it to look like a leather
hairnet. So it's got to be black and, you know, thin with some air vents and maybe a little gold
trim. It's got to look cool. And you got to get pros to wear it. And the people go, all right.
You know, and that helped, but it wasn't until it was mandated. And again, this collective
action problem, most cyclists wanted to wear helmets because they know it's safer.
Right. But when some of them don't wear it, they get a slight advantage. It's like, well,
it's like doping. I got to do it because that guy's doing it. Right. And then once it's mandated,
okay, no one gets to take the drug. Everyone has to wear a helmet. It's like, okay, good.
I want to take you down a slight detour. Now that we're talking about the Tour de France
and also about technology and innovation and doping and things like that. Greg LeMond was the
first American to win the Tour de France. And he's like a fascinating figure who also embraced
every technological innovation he could. And there was one Tour de France in particular where he
beat Laurent Fignon, who eschewed technology. It was like, oh, that's like American stupidity
and things like that, lost by seconds over a 21 day race. How important is
like understanding technology and innovation and kind of pushing that forward? How is the best way
to make that happen? Or more people embrace that? Well, it happens naturally. It kind of
triggers down from the pro ranks to serious weekend athletes and people have more money now
and the bikes are better than they used to be. They really do get better. Like I get a new bike
every three to four years and every one of them is really better than the previous one. Maybe
just a little bit, just 1%, 2%, but you can feel the difference and disc brakes instead of the rim
brakes, they're better. Electronic shifting is better. And it just kind of starts to add up. But
because of the market, because of capitalism, what would have been say a $15,000, $20,000 bike
I could get for like $6,500 now because so many people are buying them because they really are
better and you see all the pros race. Do you think this is part of the problem of our current
moment? And now I'm leaping from kind of technological innovation and bike racing or
something to in general, I mean, the world is so much better than it was 50 years ago,
but we don't seem to want to recognize that or acknowledge that. And is that a problem?
It's hard to see because it happens slow enough. Like again, the bike thing, you know, it's if I
was a regular weekend warrior or whatever, and maybe I'd buy a bike every 10 years and oh, okay,
I really see it. But when you buy him incrementally, he's like watching your kid grow. You see the
pictures from three years ago. Oh, wow. You don't notice it, right? And you know, that's hard to
see, you know, Pinker talks about that. And Matt really does, you know, you know, just the cost of
how many hours a week you have to work to get your dinner or your light. You know, Matt has those
charts. Yeah. And it's like, Oh, wow. I mean, it's just just very incrementally, very slowly over
decades and centuries. And you know, from day to day, we don't see that because our senses are geared
to immediate environment, you know, the next day, the next week, that's about it. That's all we care
about. Because we're really designed to pay attention to threats. So the negativity bias.
So we focus on bad things, rather than the good things, and also immediate threats. And
and the way the world works, because of second law and entropy, is that, you know, good things happen
mostly very gradually, slowly over long periods of time, but bad things can happen. Boom. You know,
you get the stroke or the heart attack, or the company goes out of business, the thought collapses,
the country falls. These things happen very quickly. So we're tuned to looking for those
kind of threats, because those are the things that took us out. Just to close out the tour
to France, you know, beginning with Le Monde and going through Lance Armstrong, this, to me,
I found it interesting that, you know, Americans didn't care about bike racing. It was it was like
ridiculously European and all of that. And it was kind of like soccer in the 70s and 80s. It like
picked up. And then Lance Armstrong, and you know, and people after Americans after him who were
caught doping and cheating and whatnot after protesting that they hadn't. You know, now we
don't care about bike racing in the same way, right? And is that, you know, has that happened
all over society, where I mean, we live in an era now, things are getting better and better,
but our trust and confidence in institutions and in society have been declining. You know,
what, how do we how do we deal with that kind of dynamic? Interesting analogy. Yeah, well,
there are Americans in the tour this year, but they're not doing that well. It definitely
punctured the, I mean, there was a growing interest in things like professional cycling and
certainly the tour. You know, and I guess, and it's even broader than, you know, just America,
I mean, the revelation of, you know, profound doping, which in a way goes back to the very
early beginning of the tour, there were doping controversies that vary from the beginning.
And I'm kind of big on performance enhancing drugs. I kind of, you know, I don't just let
everybody do it. Well, or yeah, I mean, but then you do have rules in these, but you know. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with you. I mean, I guess if it didn't trickle down to junior athletes that are up and
coming and you get that again, that you get that kind of collective action problem and like,
well, I don't want to do it, but that guy's doing it. And I want to get to his level and so on.
And that's how it happens. That's how it happened with Lance. I mean, it's unfortunate. He was
not able to articulate that very clearly on Oprah's couch there that, you know, when he didn't
start any of this, he just did it better than everybody else was doing it. And he hired the
top guy and said, you can't work for anybody else and give you pile of money to an exclusive.
And, and, you know, but there's, you know, when he was first starting and he was getting his
ass kicked and, you know, it's like, why is this happening? And somebody said, see that guy there
and that guy there, they're doping. They're using this, they're using that. They're going to that
guy over there. He's the top doping. Oh, okay. And then, so here's the choice. I either do it
or I'm out. Right. And then, you know, you don't get to fulfill your dreams. So they do it. You
know, it's a, it's a rational choice, I think. And there's, I mean, I guess in, in humans,
would you say in evolution, there's this, there are these two tendencies. One is that we want
excellence, but then we also, and we're willing to do almost anything for it, but then we are
very disappointed if not in ourselves and our heroes when they actually do what we're kind of
urging them to do, which is take, you know, pay any price in order to become the best at something.
Right. Yeah, I'm not sure you have to put it at such extremes though, because you have
this spectacular performances that you, where you don't need the drugs maybe, but again, you just
have to, you have to have good enforcement. I mean, there was an interesting thing when Rafa
won the French Open this year. And then it came out like a week later that his, his foot was all
shot up with all kinds of drugs and stuff because he has some weird problem there. And a couple
of cyclists were commenting, boy, if we did that, we'd be kicked out and we'd be shamed and, and
humiliated in the front pages of the newspapers. And it is true. The doping agencies like the,
you know, that governs sports are terrible or very arbitrary and just incompetent. I mean,
in, in many ways. And I can recall Olympic swimmers, you know, losing their gold medals
because they had taken the wrong kind of cold medication or whatever. Whereas the NFL, you
know, their program was, you know, you have the doping agency has to contact the player's agent
and then set a date to test it like in three weeks. Okay, no problem. We'll clear it all out.
Let's close up by talking about skeptic, the skeptic society, skeptic magazine 30 years
and running. You know, explain what the skeptic society is about.
Well, we're a 501c3 nonprofit science education is our thing critical thinking,
rationality, you know, reason that they're, you know, a commitment to universal realism. There
is a reality. We can know something about it. I'll be it not perfectly, you know, that kind of
enlightenment ideals of the search for objective truth through tried and true methods, you know,
that's kind of our, our thing. And just, we just try to tackle subjects that are important. Right.
And as you see with the abortion issue, trans issue, next one on race, you know, we've already
done astrology, big foot UFOs. Right, right. You can only do those things so much. Yeah. And it's
like, okay, we pretty much know what the story is there. Let's find out. It's amazing how the
Loch Ness Monster and the Bermuda Triangle, just people don't care about those anymore. No, I know
they're out, but the UFOs are back because of the UAP thing. Absolutely. Yeah. But and although it
seems like this is the end of UFOs, right, like it's obvious that it's, you know, it's not extraterrestrial.
It should be obvious to everybody, although it's still pretty popular that ancient alien show
is on its 18th season. Wow. That's great. I mean, it's up there with the apprentice or something,
right. But so I want to ask you, is this a good time to be a skeptic in terms of like, does
rationality and again, understanding that it's imperfect, we all have, you know, our cognitive
bias and all of that kind of stuff. Is there more broadly speaking, are we more rational than we
were 50 years ago? Or is that never the way to really think about this? There's a big debate
in cognitive cycles of to what extent are we naturally gullible and we fall for things like
cults and scams, things like that, because people do fall for those things. But the counter argument
to that is in fact, most people don't fall for cults and scams. The reason these scammers have to
send out, you know, million emails to get one sucker is because most people are not suckers,
right. And, you know, most people who join religious sex and groups and self-help groups,
and they go to Tony Robbins, you know, weekend, they're not joining cults. And if the thing
turned into a cult, they probably would leave, right. So we only hear, there's an availability
here, we only hear about the ones, you know, the Jonestown and Waco and, you know, sort of the
crazy ones, the, you know, Heaven's Gate. But those are really rare, right. And so I've been
thinking about this, you know, to what extent this is called default to truth. You know, when you
tell me something, I just tend to believe you because I, because I know you, I don't have time
to fact check everything you tell me. So there's kind of a social trust that most of the time works,
right. And I was just telling people about the story I read of this guy, a cyclist, who, do you
know what Strava is? You know, you post your rides on this app. And then on Strava, there's these
King of the Mountain KOM, every segment is timed. And, you know, there's thousands of people who've
done that segment. And you can see what the average speed was. You try to go out there and break
that guy's time order. Well, so there was this guy who turns out he was like a total conman, fraud,
you know, an impersonator. I mean, he said he had, he was a CEO of a major corporation. He had been
in IPO startups and he was in special forces and on and on and on. And he was a professional bike
racer on this European team. And the people wherever he was living in California, I think,
you know, no one bothered to check until he posted a time on a Strava KOM that somebody
saw and went, that's not possible. The speed was like what a top European pro would do. And this
guy's like 45 years old is like, wait a minute, I'm going to look into what else he's done, right.
But, but if I just heard, you know, I was in the special forces, okay, I mean, I wouldn't even
know how to check if you told me that. Who would I call this was, you know, Nick, really a Navy
Seal guy. I wouldn't even know, right. So I think for the most part, we're not gullible so much as
the trust thing works pretty well most of the time. But evolution did not eliminate all the
psychopaths and the free riders and the liars and the deceivers and the cheaters, because that would
take too much energy to get rid of every last one, right. So a society can tolerate like a small
percentage of of con men and liars and cheaters and thieves and so on, and still function reasonably
well. What's your favorite cult? Well, I guess this is going to sound crazy, the cult of Trump at
the moment. Yeah, I mean, I really think it is something like that. You know, just even just
yesterday, just after the latest January six hearings where it's obvious to anyone with
eyes and ears that, you know, he knew he lost and he was just a make a grab for power and you
still see some of these Republican toadies. Yeah, tons of Republicans, people running for office
saying that the election was stolen. Right. Now, it could be there just opportunists saying I got
to say whatever I think the boss wants me to say so that he gives me his endorsement so I can win
the election. I don't really believe it. That's possible. But what concerns me is that, you know,
like 60% of self identified Republicans say they and they have nothing to gain. They just,
yeah, I think there was I think rigged, right? Yeah, I think it was rigged. That's a kind of
conspiracy theory and maybe even a cult that's not on the fringe. What's the, you know,
what's the status of skepticism is more important than ever. Because, you know, most of these
conspiracy theories that I've used to deal with, you know, the JFK or 9 11, they're pretty fringy,
right? And this one is, you know, right there at the top of the government. And I'm worried this
could threaten our democracy. If enough people believe this, they won't accept the outcome of
the next election. Do you worry going into the midterms by all accounts that Democrats are going
to lose big for a variety of historical reasons? President, when the president is unpopular in
his first midterm election, they, you know, he loses 25 to 35 seats, etc. Democrats are already
starting to rehearse how these elections, you know, the Supreme Court is not legitimate. The
Republicans have stripped people of voting rights all over the place. Do you worry that?
I do. So we're going to go from a right wing conspiracy theory about illegitimate elections
to a democratic one. Yes. Well, the, the Dems have always had conspiracy theories whenever
they lost. If you just go back to the last 50 years in every election, this one was slightly
different because it ended up at the Capitol. But, but yes, of course, they're going to, I'm
worried that if a Republican genuinely wins, say in 24, whoever it is, maybe DeSantis, hopefully
not Trump, that the Dems won't accept it. They'll just say, nah, we know they were doing this behind
the scenes and the gerrymandering this and that. This was all illegal. And then what? You know,
then we're in trouble. Well, although I suspect skeptic magazine circulation is going to go up.
I don't know. Or it's going to go out of business. One or the other, right? I find most people,
they're not that interested in the truth. You have to kind of remind them this, why this is
important. I feel like Liz Cheney sometimes, you know, standing up there going, you know,
what actually happened matters, reality matters, right? And I mean, what a funny thing. I mean,
she's my hero. And I don't agree with her on almost everything, politics, right? You know,
do you hope, I mean, well, do you hope people are becoming more independent minded?
I mean, that would help. Yeah. I like Andrew Yang's idea of a third, a viable third party,
of course, he's not the first, forward party. I like this idea. Right. I'm not a big UBI guy.
But, you know, I think we, the duopoly, he talks about the duopoly, you know, Germany,
where my wife's from, they have what six or seven parties that are viable parties. No one gets more
than 50%. I mean, no one gets more than really 20, 25%. That's good. That sounds great. That's
good. Now to end on Michael Shermer. Thanks for talking. You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
