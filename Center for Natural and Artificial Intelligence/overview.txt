1. **Progress in Semiconductors vs. Other Fields**: While there has been significant progress in semiconductor technology (fueled by Moore's Law), other engineering fields like aerospace, nuclear engineering, and mechanical or chemical engineering have seen slower advancements since the late 1980s, with electrical engineering being somewhat of an exception.

2. **Economic Incentives**: The economic success and compensation in the tech industry, particularly in computer science, have outpaced other fields, including engineering disciplines.

3. **Barriers to Entry**: The advancement in semiconductor technology requires massive investments in infrastructure (e.g., $500 million ASML machines for lithography) that make it difficult for individuals or smaller companies to innovate and compete in this space.

4. **China's Challenge**: China is advancing in technology but is still primarily using older, chemical-based methods. While they may eventually catch up due to their significant investments, there are still hurdles they face, such as access to advanced lithography equipment like ASML machines.

5. **Venture Capital Investment**: Venture capitalists have largely stayed away from investing in semiconductors due to the complexity and scale of the industry, indicating a slower pace of innovation and entrepreneurship in this sector compared to computer science.

6. **Global Competition**: The global race for technological supremacy is intense, with China making strides that could potentially lead to convergence with Western technology if progress continues at a similar pace.

In summary, while there has been considerable advancement in semiconductor technology, other engineering fields have seen more modest progress. The high cost and complexity of modern semiconductor production create significant barriers to entry, impacting innovation and investment across the field. Global competition, particularly with China, remains a critical concern as both sides strive for technological leadership.
