Checking CBS 17/Is social media making us more socially awkwardï¼Ÿ.txt
 The summary of the provided text is as follows:

Many people start their day by checking their phones, scrolling through emails and social media to stay updated on events while they were sleeping. While this isn't inherently problematic, it can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction with others. Michelle McKenney, the owner of Third Degree Solutions, points out that excessive engagement with digital likes and comments on social media is contributing to social awkwardness among students and young people. The reliance on texting and online interactions has made some individuals uncomfortable during in-person conversations, especially when dealing with awkward silences. McKenney emphasizes the importance of developing and maintaining strong face-to-face communication skills at all ages. She will be discussing strategies to improve these skills on television at 5 o'clock. The key issue is that digital interactions can sometimes replace meaningful in-person conversations, leading to misunderstandings and a lack of emotional nuance, as tone and intent are not as clearly conveyed through text alone.
