All this week, Dr. Eric Weinstein, the mathematician,
many credit with founding the Intellectual Dark Web,
wrote a despairing post on X that summed up
his feelings on America's big decision day.
It read, I'm failing in this election.
I try, but I simply failed.
I cannot work within these concepts,
my world, my country, my America is not on the ballot.
Well, that post has been viewed over 7 million times already,
with many echoing his lament.
But many commentators have accused Dr. Weinstein
of sitting on the fence of squandering
his significant influence at a critical moment
for the country, and he joins me now.
Eric, great to have you back on Uncensored.
You decided in the end to say what you said,
and you saw the extraordinary reaction to that,
good, bad, and ugly.
A lot of people saying you've been a bit cowardly here.
What do you say to them?
Well, I find that somewhat funny,
because standing up to one political party alone
is bad enough, standing up to two just makes things worse.
In general, to me, cowards lead mobs, they incite mobs,
and they fight from within mobs, particularly
behind the veil of anonymity.
So it has nothing to do with that,
and I also think that the post was widely misinterpreted.
So let's clarify what you meant.
So tell me what you really meant by that post.
Sure.
Imagine that you have two restaurants,
and that both of them are failing the health grade.
One of them may be failing the health grade
by much more than the other,
because it has problems with fecal matter and the food, let's say.
You may say I can tolerate the risk
of going to the one that's less dangerous,
but you can't recommend the restaurants to somebody else,
because quite frankly, they're both super dangerous.
Now, in my opinion, the Democratic Party
has become something completely understandable, unrecognizable,
and its leadership appears, in my mind, to be evil,
and that is my party.
The Republican Party is far more chaotic,
but both parties have chosen a strategy
where instead of courting common-sense people,
somewhat in the middle, although I don't think
it's a linear spectrum anymore at all,
they've decided to hang on to their extremes
and pretend that they aren't there
or not incredibly toxic and violent,
and in part, you know, my frustration is
that in order for me to recommend a party,
and I was hoping to recommend a ticket this election cycle,
I don't think Kamala Harris and Tim Walts
have given me any possibility of recommending them,
so unless somebody can make that argument to me
directly in the last few days,
I just see it as an impossibility.
I was very disappointed, in some sense,
because I have three friends in the Big Six
on the Republican side,
which would be RFK Jr., Tulsi, and JD Vance,
and, you know, my feeling about this
is that we have a situation by which
the Republican Party is just completely unconscious,
and if you see the reaction,
just search on my name in the word Jew.
You'll see exactly how much toxicity is hiding
amongst the good people of MAGA,
and too few of them, by the way,
have the courage to stand up
when somebody's being attacked,
and so I think it's a bit rich
that the cowards who privately message me
and say, we support you,
don't say something in public
when they're watching a mob to send on an individual,
and quite honestly, I wasn't hoping to take on MAGA,
but if that's what it takes to stand up
and say, you cannot brutalize people like this
in citing mobs against individuals
is what I thought you were accusing the Democrats of doing,
and now you've stared into the abyss and it stares back.
I mean, Chris Rufo said,
this is narcissism marked as idealism.
It's absurd to expect politics
to conform to one's individual preferences
and idiosyncrasies.
The essence of politics is decision
under imperfect conditions.
If you can't figure out how to rank Trump and Harris,
you're just navel-gazing.
Your response?
Chris who?
I mean, it's sort of my response.
In other words,
this is an individual who's been very successful
arousing passions,
and he's been very effective in being very aggressive.
I think he has actually an excellent point
that in many ways the Republicans have been too passive,
and so in order to compensate
for that flaccid
aspect of
Republicans rolling over in the past,
he's decided to go
red meat as to whether it's narcissism
or navel-gazing or cowardice or fence-sitting
or any of the other epithets.
I was hoping he would dig a little bit deeper
into his thesaurus,
but it's offensive,
and I'm just not going to get particularly exercised.
People have heard me ad nauseam
about the problems with the Democratic Party,
if I was to join MAGA,
I would start criticizing MAGA
in particular for blinding itself
to the real problems of January 6th,
just the way I point out
that on the Democratic side,
I don't believe it was a free and fair election
in 2020
because of the interference through the tech companies,
and
a problem
with the news media that I would call
a rhizome.
A rhizome is a quaking aspen.
I think you see a bunch of different trees,
but it's actually one organism
and all you're seeing
is it breaking through
the ground in different places.
For some reason,
the Democratic machine
seems to control all sorts of different newspapers
that basically
engage in something which I've called
journal painting, which is campaigning
while pretending that you have
immunity
under the guise of journalism.
This is the surge
of these elections.
I've called the 2020 election not free and fair,
and I've called the January 6th
and the Georgia interference
a serious question,
and everyone I know who's chosen one side
or the other will blind themselves
to one of these two facts.
I'm trying to get America back
to my friends in the Republican Party.
I understand
that there are winners and losers,
and that's how you think and how you talk,
but it matters how you win,
and if you don't believe me,
try to think about how many people
have a poster of Lance Armstrong on their wall.
Right, that's a very good point.
What you did came at a time
when there's a lot of attention around
some of the major newspapers in America
from the Washington Post
to the LA Times, USA Today,
all deciding not to endorse
anybody at this election,
which has caused fury with their
journalists
because historically they voted Democrat,
and in a way
it's exposed the very liberal leanings
of many of these newsrooms
at this fury amongst journalists
that they haven't once again said,
Vote Democrat, but Jeff Bezos
who owns the Washington Post said this,
he said, most people believe the media is biased,
anyone who doesn't see this
is paying scant attention to reality,
and those who fight reality lose.
Presidential endorsements do nothing
to tip the scales of an election,
but what they actually do
is create a perception of bias,
a perception of non-independence.
Ending them is a principle decision
and it's the right one.
Obviously it's a different circumstance to you
and the pressure that you came under
to endorse either side,
but what did you make of Bezos' argument
for not allowing the Washington Post
to endorse?
Mr. Bezos, you have far larger problems
than the endorsement issue.
You have a problem of journalism.
Let me point out you went after me
because I was the supposed
far-right podcast host
who had J.D. Vance on his program.
When I did that,
I talked to him about something called
the grandmother hypothesis,
which is a scientific theory
put forward by effectively George C. Williams
and his students.
You covered that
I think in 2015
and you wrote in your paper,
not you personally, but the journalist,
teaching children is what drives evolution.
There's no good evolutionary reason
for women to live past
their ability to reproduce
and instead what you did
is you took my far more careful statement
talking about evolutionary females
and you
tried to tar J.D. Vance
with it as if we were both
opting to enslave
older women only for the care
of the young.
Quite honestly what you have
is a paper that is effectively
lobbying for the right
to be hypocritical. You're an anti-science organization.
If you want
me to explain to you
how you violated journalistic ethics
as by the society professional
journalist Code of Ethics,
which has undergone many revisions,
any version of it, you're not bending over
backwards to do objective journalism,
you have a printed Code of Ethics,
all you need to do is follow it.
I applaud the fact that you were starting
to being an actual newspaper,
but right now what you have
is an anti-scientific
wing of the Democratic
party of the United States, and that's not
a partisan position, that is my party
and I would previously have regarded
The Washington Post as one of the three finest
newspapers in the United States of America.
What's going on? You better fix it, you're rich enough
to do it, stop dragging
your feet, and it's time to make
reparations to the people that your paper
has wronged, but if you
choose to start with me, I would be delighted.
Should newspapers of that
stature endorse anyway?
I mean, it's Bezos, I'm not
withstanding the criticisms you've just outlined,
it's Bezos right in the principle
that the Post didn't historically
used to endorse until, I think,
several decades ago,
and then they began to endorse.
Is it something a newspaper should do?
Or is he right, the instinctive,
if you want to avoid a suggestion
of bias, you just shouldn't get into
the endorsement business?
Traditionally, there's a Chinese wall
between the news division
and the opinion and editorial
pages of a paper, and if that Chinese
wall is strong,
then both of them give us some insight
because, in fact, the editors are sitting
over the news, and this is their opportunity
to say we are biased
by what we see, and we wish to give
normative judgments rather than merely
descriptive judgments of the news as we see it.
In the current era, there should be
no endorsement. The most important
thing is for news organizations to go back
to being journalistic organizations.
The reporters simply flagrantly
violate the printed
code of ethics, and this isn't
difficult, it's just that everybody
has been having a bach naal
rather than
following the rules of journalism.
This has been an orgy
of partisanship and journal
painting, and we don't know what to do about it.
And, quite honestly, you're rich enough
to clean it up.
The
big furory that blew up at the weekend,
I was at the rally at Madison Square Garden
the first one I've been to of Trump's,
and it sparked garbage gate
in all his guises and everything. Let's take a little
mash-up look at the rally itself,
and I'll come to you with a question.
Our pimp handlers will destroy
our country.
I'm not going to do conspiracy,
and I'm not not going to do conspiracy.
But it's kind of funny that they tried everything
else, and now they're trying to kill him.
They better not!
I don't see no
sticking Nazis in here.
Homeless and veterans, Americans,
Americans
sleeping on their own feces
on a bench in Central Park.
But the f***ing illegals
they get whatever they want, don't they?
The only thing I see in here
are a bunch of hard-working
men and women
that are real Americans, brother.
Now, it was interesting to me
we'll get to garbage gate in a moment,
but Arnold Schwarzenegger
seems to have gone on a similar kind of journey
as you've done about questioning
who he should be endorsing.
Ultimately, he did come down,
excuse me, but he came down on the side
of Kamala Harris, and he explained,
we need to close the door on this chapter of American
history. I know that former President
Trump won't do that. He will divide,
he will insult, he will find new ways
to be more un-American than
he already has been, and we the people
will get nothing but more anger.
He said, I'll always be an American
former Republican. That's why
I'm voting for Kamala Harris
and Tim Waltz. What did you
make of his explanation
for why he would be voting against
his historic party?
And in relation to what we saw at Madison
Square Garden, were you concerned
about the rhetoric that came off the
stage there or not?
It's a bunch of different questions,
so let me do my best.
First of all, I can't
possibly figure out how he imagines
that the Democratic Party
can put the country
back together again. My guess is
is that only Donald Trump can further
divide it or put it back together,
and if it's Kamala Harris, we're going to
be waiting probably a period of
four years, given that she won
no primaries and her
party has pulled off the mask as
to
how it chooses to operate. Donald
Trump could further divide us, or he could
choose to unite us, and in fact, if he decided
to go with the super ticket idea
and say, look, you don't have to vote for me.
Vote for any of the six.
That's an ingenious political move.
It will change American politics forever
because it will give people the ability
to
see that he's put his own ego aside.
He didn't choose to do that. I think that
Donald Trump could.
He has an ability to be very presidential
when he likes, and he has an ability
to be
on wheels when he feels
it's warranted.
I think if you look at the second potential
shooter of Donald Trump,
you have to be
really
unwilling to consider conspiracies
before
you start worrying about
what a single bullet
could do to the entire country.
It would be
a tragic occurrence if it were
to end the life of Donald Trump.
But
I'm not really sure people
have an idea of what would happen
in a heavily armed country
had that second
shooter got off a shot that found its
mark. I think we are
teetering.
We are on a time
I don't know what the right analogy is.
We are in a very precarious situation.
My decision to stay out
in part is to take a hit during
the election
because there have to be voices for afterwards.
If you recall, you need people
when tensions are high
who have not gone
partisan. I'm just going to take a bunch
of lumps and say that
right now
we've had two, two and a half
shooters
towards Donald Trump.
I worry that there is an amendment to the Constitution
maybe the 14th section 3
that could
provide for a challenge saying that
we are a directionist
if January 6th was called that way
could not assume office.
I'm not sure where we are.
Where we are is extremely precarious
and as I said before on Chris
Williamson's program
I'm not sure that Donald Trump will be allowed
to become president. I definitely
believe that if it's a landslide
he stands a far better chance.
But I believe that the foreign policy
machinery of the United States is sufficiently
worried about what he would do
what he would do with NATO
how he would handle
the attempted permanent
alliances and agreements
of the United States while
in office that it feels incredibly threatened
and I really do think that
grown up responsible people
need to pay far more attention to the second
shooter than the first.
When you say Trump wouldn't be
allowed to be president, what do you actually mean
by that?
I don't know.
I'm trying to say that I think that there are elements
who view
potentially the release of information
around Jeffrey Epstein
who view information around
potentially the JFK assassination
who worry about
covert operations
in Ukraine becoming exposed
or compromised. I think that there are
a great number of things
that are quiet
that
are assumed to be
respected by both
political candidates and I think
what's happened is that you've got a populist
who has signaled that he is not
going to play by the rules of the permanent
class in Washington D.C. and beyond
and I believe that that
is Donald Trump's best
quality. It is the thing for which he is
most beloved
and I think it is the thing that he is
within the Beltway he is
most feared and hated for
and I just don't think people
understand the depth to which
certain operatives will go
to potentially frustrate his campaign
and frustrate you is a word
that I choose to leave ambiguous.
Another conservative commentator, Mike
Sanovic, he said of your
decision not to make a decision
or not to choose a party
he said this is pathetic, every word you
write he said, it was his moral
cowardice and a pivotal moment in American
history. This is self-important
horseshit best suited for the therapist
chair. Do you have
a response to that? I mean that is
the more visceral end of the
rage that your decision seems to
be in some conservative circles.
You know as somebody who stands up to mobs
regularly I am not really worried about
somebody trying to fit me with a pink tutu
in front of the world. I know
Mike is a very, very smart guy
I have found him
a long time ago even when he was
radioactive.
I think he is a guy who really believes
in what he calls the guerrilla mindset
and the idea is that they are winners
and losers. There are real men
and there are pussies and so in that
snap to grid universe that is what I am
he knows better why he chose
to do that in public. I have no idea
but I am not going
to go after Mike Sanovic
in public right now
and I will just say this
boy the MAGA people are bad
strategists. The idea of trying
to figure out whether you can incite
me to say a bunch of really negative
things about MAGA right
before an election or the idea that you
want me to move out of the Democratic Party
towards the Republicans where I am far
more important being
a critic of my own party
these guys just don't seem to understand
in some
sense how to win properly
how to have allies and if you wanted to
ask me to answer the question about Madison Square Garden
I would be happy to.
Yeah please do.
So I think that basically
the
left of center people don't understand the
amount of love and positivity
and hope and energy
that that party has which is not
dead from the neck down
I think that there was a
huge coming together of people
brown
blue green yellow
white doesn't matter, Jews
Muslims etc etc that said
I think it was very heavily tilted
towards red meat
it was very heavily tilted towards
men over women the edgy comic
Tony Hinchcliffe
I'm going to just stand up for him and say he's
absolutely brilliant I know him a little personally
in person he's
the nicest sweetest human being
he was talking not about humans as garbage
he was talking about a garbage problem
on an island that has landfills
nevertheless very
dangerous to do
that kind of insult comedy
in a Madison Square Garden
there was an attempt to tie it to the 1939
rally I can promise you
I've gone to Eric Clapton concerts
at Madison Square Garden nobody made
a comparison
of Eric Clapton to Nazis
these people are fighting
in just a
horrific smear campaign
where the Democratic Party's chief tool
is personal destruction
and they're trying to destroy people who went
and targeted them with the brush of Nazis
now that said
there are absolutely bigots
anti-Semites
really horrible
people inside of MAGA
that MAGA will not clear out
just the way I'll tell you
this way the Democratic Party will not
clear out the people
who were celebrating October 7th
as an act of resistance by the great
humanitarian sin war
and the Republicans will not clear out
the people shouting at me that I should go back
to Israel because what have Jews ever done
for America were basically a fifth column
in the United States
check your nuclear weapons and see who made you
the absolute strongest country
as Americans
I'm sick to death
of people being quiet
I'm talking not about the bad people in MAGA
I'm talking about the really good people
the people I love who's back I have
in MAGA
you don't have my back
you contact me privately rather than publicly
and you know that this is dangerous talk
it's not just a question of quote
those mean tweets
you've got that wrong this is the precursor
to really bad things happen
look at what happened in Beolu and Istanbul
during the 50s
what happened in Germany in the 30s
when you allow people to start
talking recklessly like this
this is the appetizer
it's the prelude it's the precursor to violence
and quite honestly
both of these parties should have thrown
the bad apples out
and competed for the middle
and the moderates and the reasonable people
and instead they were pussies
and they clung to their extremists
in order to win an election
and it's going to be up to those of us
who have to stand up to both of these parties
to put this country back together
and you know I'm not going to use my French
on this podcast
but I'm sick to death of men with masculinity issues
yelling coward at people
who stand up to mobs
if you want to incite a mob or you want to hide within one
or you want to hide behind anonymity
you've given us your calling card
Eric you said you're not going to endorse
but does that mean necessarily
that you're not going to cast a vote
could it be that you may vote privately
without saying who you voted for
absolutely
yeah yeah
in other words either party
could have looked at itself
and said you know what we have a huge problem
and we're willing to look at ourselves
in order to win the people
who want a home
I don't want to be homeless
and I'm by the way Chris Ruffo
and Mike Cernivore they just don't get it
I can look past all sorts of things
the threshold for me endorsing a party
means that that party
isn't going to corrode me
in order to keep my membership card
in other words I intend
to talk about the problems of Georgia
and the fact that the election of 2020
was not free and fair
if you require me
to blind myself
to one set of those things
I can't join you and I can't
recommend you to others
now does that mean that I'm not willing
to take the risk when I go to the ballot
box and cast a vote
no I'm willing to do it I have four choices
I can vote for Kamala Harris
I can vote for Donald Trump and the super ticket
I can vote for a third party
or a right in candidate and thereby
avoid the choice or I cannot vote at all
the only thing that I'm
really thinking is not going to happen
is I probably cannot find any way
a path to voting for Kamala Harris
but what I choose to do privately
is not a question of wimping out
you also had the opportunity to win me over
and what I said in the next tweet
which we haven't mentioned
is I'll work with anyone who wants to put the country back together
but if the idea is
show us how tough you are
put on a MAGA hat or show us
you know that you're true blue and you'll sing from the blue hymnal
you got to be kidding
boy do you have a wrong number
and Eric finally
who do you think is going to win this election
I think it's going to be Donald Trump
if it's counted accurately
I got to say
the theory of
no please finish
it's in part due to the
theory of Timor Quran
I have
I think in eight years I've never seen a human
being wearing a MAGA hat
and I've traveled all over the country
I don't know how that's possible
people hide their support
for Donald Trump because
Donald Trump makes life hard
he makes it ugly
if you have
let's say a male female divide in your family
or you have a family
that's dependent on a blue employer
or whatever
Donald Trump is quite honestly
completely inconsiderate about the problems
that he's causing inside of your world
you know he's just
he's boorish and he's a brute
on the other hand you can easily make the case
as Dave Rubin has said artfully
he said you can't dream about a panther in a china shop
you're getting a bull whether you like it or not
if you want some of the china knocked over
all of it's going to get knocked over
now what my opinion is
is it's going to risk
a brute
to break out of this incredible
stranglehold
that the democratic party
rhizome the journal painting
the academic institutions
all of these things that are
supposedly neutral that always seem to go
in one direction
they have to figure out how to break that
stranglehold now what you're seeing
is that these newspapers are choosing not to
break out of their countries
and she's a horrible horrible candidate
as a result of that
we don't know who's
running the country
Biden's declining mental condition
if you'll check my old tweets
I've been talking about this for four years
what we have is we have a national
mass delusion
that in some sense the democratic party
is playing by the rules when it isn't
and
you know
the question is do you want a brute
who might actually be a greater
danger or he might be the thing
like radiation or chemotherapy
that you need to kill the cancer
if it doesn't kill you first
very wisely as always
fascinating to get your perspective
I really appreciate it
Pierce thanks very much for having me on
