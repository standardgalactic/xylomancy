Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host, Eric Weinstein, and this is sort of an unusual
edition of the portal because it's coming at the beginning of a new decade, and I wanted
to set some intentions and also to sort of recap where we've been for the last half
a year that the show has been on the air and on the internet. There are no notes, there's
nothing planned. What I'd like to do is to just try to speak directly about some of the
things that have been on my mind and give you all my thoughts on your feedback on the
show and where I think we're going to be going to next. So with your permission, let's begin.
It's been a pretty interesting half of a year. The show has built up a fairly sizable audience
and what's more, there are a lot of influential and important voices within our audience.
So I know that when I'm speaking, I'm reaching a lot of the people who would be on my dream
list of people to interview, to talk to, and in fact, to plot next steps with. So I think
we've had a pretty successful run of it. We can still grow the show bigger, but the show
is now large enough that I actually don't mind losing some of our listeners and some
of our viewers by going into more challenging topics. And so I don't think that our primary
goal is going to be building the audience quite as much as it was during the first six months.
Furthermore, I think what's been somewhat confusing is that we've had, if I recall correctly, 16
different interview episodes and one solo episode so far. And I don't think that that is exactly
what the portal was intended to be. In fact, you could argue that the portal has not even begun.
What we've done is to build up an audience and to habituate the audience to a different style
of interaction. I think we had to figure out what we were going to do if we wanted to bring you
certain high level concepts that often get lost because the admonition to make sure that you
don't lose your audience along the way means that you never get very far because you're always doing
the sort of preliminary groundwork and you're never actually getting to the meat of the issue.
And I think one of the things that we are very proud of is that we have a very motivated audience
who's willing to sometimes even listen to the show more than once or do it with a notepad
so that if there are unfamiliar concepts, they can be looked up. And in fact, we've noted that
there have been several communities springing up around the show so that people can trade their
questions. And we've been watching you guys answer each other's questions in a way that's
really been gratifying. So having a lot of experts in the audience has been a huge boon to the show.
And we hope to try to figure out how to make community in a meaningful sense, a larger
part of the show on a going forward basis. One of those efforts that's particularly special
is that we're trying to enlist artists. That could be visual artists, it could be digital artists,
it could also be musicians. And the idea we have is that that legion of artists
will be able to help push out many of the higher level ideas that we would find challenging to
do just in speech by using sort of the brain's full abilities to take in new information and
also to use the sort of the transcendent modality to kind of open hearts and minds
to truly different and unfamiliar ways of thinking. So I think we may try to get that going.
We need obviously to build a website. We need to have some way in which people who wish to avoid
advertising can can subscribe to the podcast and other people who want to contribute and be part of
this as a movement. We just held our first live show at the Ice House in Pasadena and thanks
everybody who came out. The show sold out extremely quickly, even though we sort of
didn't exactly advertise where and when it was, except for cryptically at first.
And one of the things that allowed us to do is to meet the listenership on Moss and
you know, it was a truly interesting and in many different ways diverse group of people.
There were pretty even split between anti and pro Trump voices. People got along great.
So we don't seem to be as affected as I was concerned. We might be by the election cycle.
And what I sensed was is that people really want to use the show to coalesce and come together.
And there's a lot of fear at the moment about anything tribal or anything cult like and therefore
anything that might be tribal trades at a discount. So I think we might actually take a
contrarian position and decide that the show, in fact, deserves more community based on the way
in which we see our our listenership and our viewership going. And so rather than fear that
anything would emerge with leadership, because all of course anything with leadership looks like
Hitler to many people, anything that looks at all ritualistic looks like a cult. I think we're
not going to worry about those things quite so much. So I think if I can, I'm going to try to
realize that, in fact, the audience is leading and that I need to do a better job of just accepting
that there's a lot of interest in new ways of thinking. And this is one way of kind of getting
unstuck to try to find the portal out of the stasis. And so if the show is to be true to its
original mission, I think we're going to have to take some risks, which might mean drinking songs,
it might mean ritualistic behavior, and hopefully it'll mean a lot more opportunities to interact
through live dates. The show is going to remain unabashedly a commercial enterprise, because
otherwise it would never happen. And I want to give a huge shout out to cast media, who has been
the original studio and effectively co producer of the show, along with Jesse Michaels, and
the advertisers and the sponsors who've been paying for the equipment for the people who
worked on the show so that nobody had to shell it anything in order to get this. The show would
never have happened if it wasn't taking place as a commercial enterprise. And so even though
some of you find the ads annoying, although others of you find them actually entertaining or
interesting, what we need to do is to come up with a better model and a model in which sponsors
get access to the kind of heart and passion for sticking with the show. So I think I'm going to
try to figure out how the risk fertilizer model works in earnest this year. But it's also important
to me that those of you who wish to avoid having your brain sullied with any kind of commercial
intrusion have an option to do that. We've been doing that through the YouTube videos. And in
that respect, I feel like in general, if you're willing to sit through maybe an initial ad that
rules before the video goes, you usually have an uninterrupted viewing or listening experience
thereafter. We'll try to get the videos a little bit and better sync with the audio.
But most importantly, what I want to get to is what the show is really about. And the last thing
I will say on the sort of initial housekeeping is we probably needed to recognize earlier that we
need your help. A lot of you guys are audio engineers or your graphic designers or your
website builders. I don't quite know how to source the talent we need from the pool, but
I've been bombarded by wonderful offers from many of you, some of you at the absolute top
of your field who want to help this podcast because you want to see this grow as a movement.
And maybe I was slow to recognize how genuine the interest was and just to say thank you.
I mean, I think it's just it's sort of hard to recognize that it's working
for various internal psychological reasons. I've been incredibly touched and I really want to
incorporate some of the offers of help because Lord knows we need it.
Just haven't figured out how to do it yet. So stay tuned. I think we'll be organizing that
shortly. We've now got a Facebook group for the portal podcast. We've got an Instagram
account that's growing. Twitter is still our largest following, but the actual subscriptions
to the podcast on both YouTube through Apple and other places are now quite large and I think it'll
be increasingly hard to shut down these channels to you so that even if we lose one or two of them
because of something we say, hopefully we'll remain engaged and we'll try to make sure that we're
not vulnerable to having the oxygen cut off. All right. So what is it that is happening in 2020?
What kind of a decade are we up for? What's going to be going on with the portal
during the coming year, coming 10 years? I think that the first thing that I want to signal
is that we are finally ready to take on something which I've always found terrifying
and that has to do with idea suppression. Now, before we get to idea suppression and how it
functions and what it is, I want to take new listeners through a very brief description of
how we would order the world relative to the portal and its objectives. So if you will,
let me take you back to the end of World War II. There's a lot of prehistory, but we can't
afford to do everything. So shortly after World War II, there were two very important events
in the early 1950s from our perspective, one of which was the unlocking of the three-dimensional
structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953, and the other was the explosions of hydrogen devices
using work of Edward Teller and Stanislav Ulam and what that changed in the human picture because
we went from a short period where we were dealing with atomic bombs where ducking cover was a
plausible solution to dealing with hydrogen devices in which the destructive power was really
incalculable. It's the power of gods used to power the sun here on earth. Now, to my way of thinking,
since the early 1950s, there has been no comparable explosion of wisdom to go along with this new
found power that humans have, this new god-like power. So I've called this the twin nuclei problem
of Sel and Adam. And I think what we've had is an incredible run of luck, and I think it's the most
magical and marvelous thing, but I don't believe that we can count on luck forever. And in fact,
given some of the events of early 2020 taking place in Iraq and Iran, I would say that history
at the scale that we were accustomed to it during the, let's say, first half of the 20th century
could start up at any moment, and we're entirely unprepared for this.
Now, in the story that has this major through line that we've been following,
the next thing that happens that's really important is a guy named Derek DeSola Price
starts to calculate that science is on an exponential trajectory. And rather than thinking
that that's a great thing, he starts to understand that anything on an exponential trajectory can't
really go on because it's going to burn itself out. And if science is the original seed corn,
if you will, of technology and technology of economics, then effectively what's going to
happen in science is going to percolate through a chain, through technology and into the economy,
with a potential stagnation coming. Now, he started to arrive at these ideas, I think,
at Yale in the late 1950s. It was not well understood what he was talking about. And still,
I'm always shocked that the book Science Since Babylon, which he wrote and which discusses this
issue, is so much less well known than, say, Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions.
For some reason, this is so disparate to so many people that we actually don't discuss it much.
Studying this work led to the idea of talking about egos, that is, embedded growth obligations.
Now, embedded growth obligations are the way in which institutions play in their future
predicated on legacies of growth. And since the period between the end of World War II in 1945
and the early 1970s had such an unusually beautiful growth regime, many of our institutions
became predicated upon low variance, technology-led, stable, broadly distributed growth. Now, this is
a world we have not seen in an organic way since the early 1970s. And yet, because it was embedded
in our institutions, what we have is a world in which the expectation is still present in the
form of an embedded growth obligation. That is, the pension plans, the corporate ladders are all
still built very much around a world that has long since vanished. We have effectively become
a growth cargo cult. That is, once upon a time, planes used to land in the Pacific,
let's say, during World War II. And indigenous people looked at the airstrips and the behavior
of the air traffic controllers, and they've been mimicking those behaviors in the years since
as ritual, but the planes no longer land. Well, in large measure, our institutions are built for
a world in which growth doesn't happen in the same way anymore. All right, what then happened
was that a different structure, which I have termed the gated institutional narrative, came
to become repurposed. Now, the gated institutional narrative is like an exchange, a financial
exchange, if you will, except it's an exchange of information and ideas. And in order to actually
participate in this particular special conversation, you need to have a seat on the exchange. That is,
you need to write for an important paper like the Wall Street Journal, or you need to be
a senator or a congressman so that you can gain access to the news media, or you need to be sitting
at a news desk. In any of these situations, whether you're a professor or a reporter or a
politician, if you can gain a seat inside of the gated institutional narrative, you can attempt
to converse with other people within that particular conversation. The rest of us do not
really have the same level or kind of access to this highly rarefied discussion. And I've
previously compared this to what we would term a promotion inside of the world of professional
wrestling. It's an agreed upon structure in which people often agree to simulate dispute,
rather than actually have disputes because somebody could get really seriously injured.
But they're in fact working together to produce an engaging and regular product
for mass consumption. The problem with this gated institutional narrative is that in general,
it doesn't contain the most important ideas. And that is where the gating function comes in.
The most important ideas are likely to be the ideas that are most disruptive. What if the
entire food pyramid, for example, was wildly off? What if fats were not the great danger we
thought they were? And those waving fields of wheat that are fabled in American song, in fact,
give rise to carbs, which are very dangerous to us all. So if everything were inverted, let's say,
where in a world where instead of banishing volatility during the so-called Great Moderation
before 2008, we were actually building the tinder for the world's largest financial forest fire.
What if, in fact, we had all sorts of things exactly backwards and completely wrong? What
if diversity wasn't always a sign of our strength, but sometimes a sign of our weakness? What if,
for example, immigration, far from being an issue of xenophobes versus xenophiles, was actually an
instrument of redistribution, having very little to do with xenophobia or xenophilia to begin with?
These sorts of ideas can't be entertained inside of the gated institutional narrative.
And that's where the gating function comes in. What was originally a function intended to ensure
quality control of the narrative became an instrument for something else. And this is where
I want to introduce the most important concept that I think we will be dealing with on a going
forward basis in 2020 on this program, the disk. What is the disk? The disk stands for the distributed
idea suppression complex. Now, taking it apart, the center of it is idea suppression. Not all ideas
are good, and so idea suppression is very frequently understood as an important concept
when we're talking about something like bigotry or we're talking about something like violent
ideology. Of course, we want to suppress certain ideas. But these are not the ideas that are
principally important inside of the disk. The disk is actually a complex. It is a large collection
of different structures, and it's not controlled in any one place. Many of these have emerged
separately. But what makes an aspect of the disk, what shows you a particular component,
is that it protects institutions from individuals who are making valid and reasonable points.
So if you imagine that the institutions have become incredibly fragile because they're in
fact built for growth and that plan for their growth, if it obligates them to tell untruths
and to hide certain characteristics because they are not in fact able to grow at the rates in which
they are supposed to, you need some complex for making sure that that information doesn't reach
the bottom entrance to a pyramid structure. Let's talk about some aspects of idea suppression.
The two stories that I'm following most closely, and we can date this particular episode by talking
about current events, I think that's fine. The two stories I'm following most closely
with interest from the perspective of understanding the disk are the story of Andrew Yang and the
media and the story of Jeffrey Epstein and his recent demise. Now in neither of these cases is my
principal interest the ostensible subject matter. In the case of Andrew Yang, Andrew is going through
a weird ritual that I've noted repeatedly, election cycle after election cycle.
Perhaps the most three recent versions of this situation have been with Ron Paul in his run
for president, with Bernie Sanders in his run for the presidency, and now with Andrew Yang.
In all of these cases, we see a very bizarre behavior inside of the news media. That is,
that when the candidate starts to gain traction with the public, they become left off of lists,
they become misreported. Very often a reporter will stand in front of the graphic
that has that particular candidate alongside others, and we don't really know why this is
occurring. We don't know how these instructions are going out, but in the case of Andrew Yang,
because this is taking place in a highly connected internet era, we have people chronicling
all of the myriad ways in which Andrew Yang's candidacy is distorted. In particular, there
appears to be a different level of distortion taking place at one particular news media outlet.
We need to better understand exactly what is the political economy of the news.
In the case of Andrew Yang, the key question would be, why aren't the regular news media
and the competing news media reporting on the outside effort being made to make sure that Andrew
does not appear normally with other candidates in this democratic primary field? It doesn't make
logical sense if you believe that the principal reason for reporting on the election is to make
sure that the voters have an early opportunity to hear all voices and to begin to make their
decisions, rather than immediately trying to pick a narrative about front runners who are
always taken to be inevitable, and that's a conserved feature of this bizarre election
coverage cycle after cycle. The first thing I want to do is recommend that you Google MSNBC
and Andrew Yang and Yang Media Blackout and look at the impressive dataset that has been collected
which shows a singular focus that can be inferred from the data on Andrew Yang. Now,
to an extent this has also happened with Tulsi Gabbard, to an extent there's been some carry over
from Bernie Sanders, but Bernie Sanders showing in 2016 was so strong that the same games that were
applied to Sanders then cannot easily be applied now. But the key question we have is why is the
news media spending so much on one candidate who doesn't appear to be that large to keep that
candidate from growing? I think this is an interesting topic and what it has to do with
is making maps of silence. Now, through the efforts of Dana Boyd and the data and society group,
we've learned about a doctrine called strategic silence, and that is that there are certain
things that the media may not want to happen and therefore rather than simply reporting the
facts of the matter, they make editorial decisions so as not to give fodder or fuel for some
undesirable outcome. Now, we can partially understand that in the case of copycat killings out of
after, let's say, gun massacres, but it's much harder to understand why somebody coming from
outside of the political system would be treated to something like strategic silence or strategic
distortion. What we need to do is to have a better understanding of the maps of silence
and maps of distortion that take place in our press, and what Andrew has done that is special
and unique is that he's given us a very large N for our dataset. We now have enough different
incidents of this that we can begin to piece together what might be inferred from this very
bizarre behavior. The second example of this that I find fascinating is the death of Jeffrey Epstein.
Now, you'll hear a lot of other people say, well, Epstein didn't kill himself or it's
obviously this or it's obviously that. I have a decidedly smaller interest in those questions.
The questions that fascinate me have to do not with Epstein, not with who might have killed
him whether he died by his own hand, but they have to deal with the sense-making apparatus that is
the news media around this untimely exit from our world. Now, Jeffrey Epstein was accused of
trafficking and had a very bizarre life that is difficult for many of us to understand where he
got a slap on the wrist in Florida and appeared to operate with impunity even after his conviction
in Florida as a sex offender. What's fascinating is that if anyone remembers the Watergate era,
the news media used to go to federal agencies and ask whether or not something was true or false,
and this gave us the phrase, a non-denial denial. When the question arises, let's say in this case,
does Jeffrey Epstein have any ties to any known intelligence community? That question can be
asked, let's say, to the CIA, to the State Department, to the NSA, and you might expect
that you'd get an answer. Absolutely, this person had no ties because the idea of the
intelligence agencies being connected to a known sex trafficker seems preposterous at one level,
but you could also imagine that they'd get no comment. Now, we don't even have that in the
situation. I did this fairly recently with The New York Times and tried to simply use their
own search engine. Have you asked the question whether Jeffrey Epstein had ties to the intelligence
agencies? The other questions that arise in this case are, when is the last known recording of
Guillain Maxwell's passport crossing a border? This is a simple factual question. A reporter would
be dispatched, they would call up somebody like Interpol, they would try to find out whether
people would speak about it or not speak about it, and under any circumstances, they would be able
to print an interesting story. For example, Interpol has no comment, or Interpol says that the last
recorded border where Guillain Maxwell's passport showed up was a border crossing in New York City.
Under any circumstances, it is very bizarre to see the map of silence around these questions.
Another such question is, if Jeffrey Epstein's fortune came from currency trading,
where are the records from his office in Vallard House in Manhattan? He had a very large office
in a trophy property on the island of Manhattan, and to the best of my knowledge, I have seen no
printed discussion of where the supposed trading records of this person, who seemed to amass a
fortune. Another weird thing about this fortune is that he seemed to live life as a high-eleven figure
individual, owning islands and incredible properties and multiple jets, and yet,
all of the assets I've seen accounted for puts him instead in nine-figure territory. Now, that's
two orders of magnitude difference, and I don't think that there are many nine-figure rich who
would live anything like Jeffrey Epstein's lifestyle. It appears that most of the assets were put
towards a kind of front, if you will. We don't have any idea about where the records are of his
trading. We don't have any idea where the passport of his partner was seen last, and we also have
no confirmation that any of our major government agencies have denied that Jeffrey Epstein, the
accused sex trafficker, was tied to any intelligence community. In all of those situations, what you
can map with honesty and without having to go anywhere near Tinfoil Hat territory is that there's
something broken with our sense-making apparatus, because in the Watergate era, you could have
assigned this to a cub reporter and they would have known exactly what to do. Where are our no
comments on the record? No one knows. All right, in those two circumstances, that gives you an idea
about how the disc, the distributed idea suppression complex, works inside of journalism.
There is some sort of editorial function that is keeping us from learning certain things because
certain stories do not run. With a little bit of poetic liberty, this seems to be what Paul
Simon was talking about in Sounds of Silence. What we're listening for now are the silences.
Where else are we confronted with silence? What are the other things we would expect
where we don't hear particular ideas? Now, obviously, you have a situation where I've been
talking for quite some time about the idea that there are many reasons that one might ask to
restrict immigration. The Sierra Club used to support a restriction of immigration. Farm
workers unions used to support restrictions on immigration. But sometime in the fairly recent
past, it became an edifics of the elite that the only reason for supporting a restriction in
immigration, the only possible reason could be that you were xenophobic and probably racist.
Now, I don't exactly know where these ideas came from, but I know that these ideas are
prima facie and preposterous. They make no sense. I've been talking for some time about where are
the media willing to discuss all of the reasons that one might want to restrict immigration,
having nothing to do with xenophobia, the so-called xenophilic restrictionist perspective.
This is another place where there is no public discussion and we have no idea why. So once you
begin to look for these silences, these gaps, you start to become rather terrified that somehow
the world is not behaving properly. And that's one of the reasons that people are flocking to this
podcast. This is, however, not my major focus. My major focus of the distributed ideas suppression
complex or disc has to do with what happens inside of our universities.
Now, I'm in a somewhat unusual position in that both myself and my wife
have PhDs as well as my brother and his wife. And we've all appeared in interviews within the last
five years. So maybe you've seen all of us on camera or have some idea of how Brett Weinstein,
Heather Heying, Pia Malani, and I sound. What some of you don't know is that I believe that
inside of that group of four, one of us wrote a book immediately after getting a PhD, which is
Heather Heying's book, Antipode, about her solo travels to the jungles of Madagascar. So if you
have a young woman in your life who's looking for a pretty impressive female role model,
I would say Heather's toughness, intelligence, and grit makes for a pretty terrific reading.
And I'd recommend buying the book Antipode for that young lady.
In the case of the remaining three, none of us wrote a book immediately afterwards.
However, I think that the quality of the discoveries that were being explored
was incredibly high. And in each case, what I thought happened to those was most unexpected.
Now, what are these ideas that I'm claiming were suppressed? So I would say that in one case,
we were talking about the reasons why we die. One of these theses contained what I think is one of
the best models for the reasons that we have these finite life spans. And of course, we're
all subject to what might be called environmental insult. If a piano falls in your head while
you're walking down the street, that's usually going to be your exit. But why we age, why we get
cancer and why we die, I think has not been very well understood at the molecular level.
And I think perhaps one of the first mature attempts to do this took place in my brother's
thesis at the University of Michigan. This is one of the major ideas that I wish to be exploring in 2020.
If biology is one of the greatest ideas man has ever had in the form of natural and sexual
selection in the work of Darwin and Wallace, I would say that the other complex of great ideas,
truly top ideas, would be what I would call geometric dynamics. Those are the ideas that take
place underneath theoretical physics, whether we're talking about the standard model or general
relativity. Now we now believe that all fundamental physical phenomena can be divided between these
two great theories. In one case that of Einstein's general relativity, it's been known for about 100
years that the substrate of the theory is Riemann's theory of differential geometry, that is Romanian
geometry. What is much more recent, perhaps slightly less than 50 years old, thanks to Jim
Simons and C. N. Yang, is the knowledge that the classical theory underneath quantum field theory
is in fact a different form of geometry known as Arismanian geometry, fiber bundle geometry, gauge
theory, or you know, Steenrod geometry, whatever you want to call it. So the idea that geometry
is the birthplace of fundamental physics, I think, is now generally understood by all
practicing theoretical physicists functioning at the top level. Inside of that complex, we've been
stuck for approximately, I don't know, 47 years where theory used to lead experiment and we used
to make predictions and the predictions would usually be confirmed in relatively short order.
We have not had a period of stagnation inside of theoretical physics that mirrors this with the
closest comparable period, perhaps being the period from the late 1920s with the advent of
quantum electrodynamics to the late 1940s with the beginning of renormalization theory being ushered
in at the Shelter Island, Pocono and Old Stone conferences. So that 20-year period is now more
than doubled and we haven't been making progress. And I've been very uncomfortable with the idea
of coming forward with ideas. Why? Well, to be honest, it's very rare for anyone outside of
theoretical physics to have reasonable ideas in physics. I could explain why, but the physicists
are fantastic. They've got all sorts of no-go theorems and all sorts of considerations that
have to be kept in mind. And effectively, what they've got is a world that is so tightly constrained
when it comes to understanding where we are that almost every new idea is instantly dead on arrival.
Now, this has been incredibly demotivating to people in the field and it does feel,
from many different perspectives, like we're almost at the end, if not of all of physics,
at least of this chapter of physics. But what I'm starting to see is that the field has become
exhausted. It has been telling the same story since 1984 about how string theory is our leading
theory of quantum gravity, that quantum gravity is the replacement for Einstein's search for a
unified field. And as the accelerator turns up, the Higgs and little else as effectively no new
physical theories arise with confirmations as the only major updates to our model of the physical
world are things like massive neutrinos or the accelerating expansion of the universe coming
from experiment. The theoretical physics community has been very slow to own up to just how much
trouble it's in. It's an incredibly demanding life. It has incredible standards for rigor and
intellectual honesty. And quite honestly, it's been lying for far too long to sustain the kind
of integrity that's needed in that community. Now, I don't know whether I'm nuts, but I do know
that at previous points, I've suggested things into both the mathematical and physics communities
that have later been shown by other people to be correct. And while I was waiting for some kind of
confirmation, I was being told, Eric, you're completely off base, you're not getting it.
One of these situations involves something called the Cyberg-Witton equations, which I put forward
in the 1980s, probably 87. And I was told that these couldn't possibly be right, that they
weren't sufficiently nonlinear. I'll tell the whole story about how if spinners were involved,
then obviously Nigel Hitchens would have told us so, blah, blah, blah. None of this was true. And
in 1994, Natty Cyberg and Edward Witton made a huge splash with these equations. I remember being
in the room and seeing the equations written at MIT on the board, and I was thinking, well,
wait a minute, those are the equations that I put forward. If those equations are being put
forward by Witton, why is it that the community isn't telling him that they're wrong for the same
reasons they told me that they were wrong? This is also how idea suppression works. When you are
young and when you are vulnerable and when you need the help of older members of your academic
community to bring you forward, you're extremely vulnerable to what might be termed the Duat de
Senor of the academic community. Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, or the Prima
Note, there was an old legend that the lords of the manor would command the right to take the
virginity of every bride on her wedding night until there arose a miller's daughter known as the
Mugnaia. The Mugnaia had a different plan for she wished instead to be with her husband and not
the evil lord of the manor. What she did was she smuggled a knife underneath her robes and appeared
in the bedchamber of the lord of the manor and killed him. Now, this is celebrated in the festival
of the oranges, which is potentially the world's largest food fight in which armed combatants throw
oranges at each other. I think it's in Italy if I'm not mistaken. Celebrating the victory of the
Mugnaia. But right now, we have a problem in our intellectual disciplines, which is that when we
come forward with our best ideas, very often, even if they're slightly wrong, they're slammed. And
when they're slammed, sometimes the older members of the community then take the ideas for themselves
at a later point. This has to stop. And I think I've been trying to gather courage to put forward
some ideas, which I think some of them, some aspects of them may be wrong, but are certainly quite
interesting. And given that our leading theories have completely stalled out and failed to ship a
product for, depending upon how you count, you know, nearly 40 years or 50 years, depending upon
whether it's the anomaly cancellation or something called the Veneziano model, I think it's time to
simply ignore these people and realize that the leading lights of our most important community
have failed. If we don't figure out the full source code going beyond Einstein, going beyond
standard model, we can't know whether we're actually literally trapped in our local area,
or whether we have some hope of going out and looking at the night sky with an idea that that
might be the roadmap to our future. So whether or not we're consigned by Einstein to the Elon Musk
program, let's say, of exploring the moon and Mars, or whether, in fact, we might get on the
Star Trek or Star Wars program of exploring the cosmos, has to do with whether or not we can get
the source code. So the next thing has to do with who we are, what is this place, and what I've
called geometric unity. It is the aim of making the portal a place where I can have a channel that
cannot be controlled by the academic complex. And I'll come back to that in a second. The third
area that I want to talk about has to do with markets. Now, markets are really the sponsor
of our freedom. By having non-centrally directed locally organized human activity, free agents
are able to contract freely with each other, exchange with each other, build prosperity,
lift each other up. And if you are a progressive, you almost certainly really have to appreciate
the power of markets. But our markets are in great danger at the moment, in my opinion,
because they are being meddled with and they are returning results that indicate that only a tiny
fraction of us are worthy of reaping the true rewards of the markets, while many of us feel
that we're being left behind. If you look at the wealth structure of the silent generation,
boomer generation, generation X and the millennials or Gen Y, you see that the millennials have at
this age amassed far smaller percentages of the wealth than the boomers did at the same age.
And I don't think it's because they're lazy or they're not talented. So we have a very dangerous
situation shaping up where our younger generations are not fully bought in. In fact, in the last
year, I just bought my first house. I'm 54 years old, born in 1965. I bought one car and then had
to rebuy it when it got rear-ended. There's something very bizarre about that pattern for somebody who
is educated at an Ivy League undergraduate institution and has an advanced degree from
potentially our leading institution in the country. We've created a world in which it's simply too
hard for regular people to advance properly because the society is not growing. Now, rather than
complain about it, I'd rather do something about it. So partially what I hope to do is to show you
what's been going on with GDP and inflation by introducing a new theory that combines the two
greatest theories we have. So if you think about biology as being driven by the theory of natural
and sexual selection, and if you think about physics as being driven by geometric dynamics,
either coming from Riemann or Erasmannian geometry, then in fact, what would be the
meeting place of our two greatest theories? The only place that I'm aware of is that it takes
place in economics. And why is that? Because you have apes carrying on the theory of selection,
but by other means through markets. And what are markets? Markets are an attempt to create an
as-if physical system by uniformizing apples and oranges so that we have a basis for their
comparison by using mediums of exchange like money. So in so doing, economics is the logical
meeting place for the two greatest theories man has ever had. And this was explored in the early,
rather the mid-1990s, early to mid-1990s by P. Mellani, my wife and collaborator and myself,
in work that never got out of Harvard University. That's not quite true. There is a book called
The Physics of Wall Street by James Weatherall, which touches upon this. But this work died
because of something called the Harvard Job Market Committee. And my wife went into that
Job Market Committee meeting having her work presented there, thinking that she could apply
anywhere in the country and being told instead that she had almost nothing and that she'd be
lucky to escape with a PhD. Now, in these three cases, that is, a theory of death that comes out
of my brother's work at the University of Michigan, a theory of productivity and how our wealth is
inflated away coming out of my wife's work at Harvard, and another theory about what is this
place and how do these different geometries come together, which would be the subject of geometric
unity. All three of these ideas met a level of resistance that none of us had ever anticipated
or encountered. And I think it's been terrifying to me to think about the idea of going up against
the institutions. However, last year I made an interesting calculation. I decided to look
at the presidencies of all of our leading research institutions and to try to figure out
how many of them belonged to people who came after the baby boom.
In a previous world, let's say the world of the early 1980s, approximately half of the heads of
research institutions would be Gen X and Gen Y, that is, Xers and Millennials. However,
almost no research university, certainly almost no leading research university with, I think,
the exception of the University of California at Berkeley when I did this calculation last year,
was under anything other than the presidency of a baby boomer. Now, what had happened? Well,
we got rid of a mandatory retirement requirement that probably affected things fairly significantly,
and we began to concentrate all sorts of power in one generation's ideas. Now,
generations aren't magical things. What they are are, instead, cohorts that are exposed to some
set of circumstances that is peculiar to the time in which they are growing up. So, for example,
if your primary experience is that you work hard as a kid with a paper route and an internship,
you go to college, you work your way up a ladder, and everything works out fine, and pretty soon,
before you know it, you've got three kids in two homes, that's your idea of what a normal life is.
Now, this is sort of the basis of the meme, okay, boomer, because many of the rest of us who
followed this generation have no idea how you would accomplish that in these times.
I actually put the blame slightly more on the silent generation than most people do. I think
if you look at it, you realize that a lot of the problems that we're having now began through
intergenerational issues initiated by the silence rather than the boomers, but it's a pretty stark
division between the Xers Millennials and Gen Z and the silence and the boomers as the major
generations that are still extended. In this situation, it's terrifying to say what I'm about
to say next, but it is time to inflict ourselves on our own institutions. It is time to have
Gen X candidates for presidencies, not necessarily just of the political parties, because we've spent
what is it, 20 years on men born in the summer of 1946 so far. I mean, we're just at the beginning
of Baby Boom Presidencies and we've been doing it since 1992. That doesn't make a lot of sense.
On the other hand, I think that the presidencies of companies or CEO roles, I think that the
issue of university presidents, many of these things have been tilted far too much towards
these other generations. I think that Gen X has a very interesting story to tell. We were not highly
infantilized in terms of when we were growing up. In fact, we had the moniker of the latchkey kids
and we're also not large enough to get things just by chanting them. We have always had the
pressure of having to make some degree of sense because we're just too small as a generation.
In fact, what I'd like to do, I've said that I believe that string theory is effectively an
affirmative action program for mathematically talented baby boomers who do not wish to sully
themselves with the problem of working on the physical and real world as we have it.
What I'd like to do is to bring you these three theories over the course of the next year or
two. That is, a theory of death, a theory of markets and how the agents within those markets
and the measurement of those markets should be changed and understood, and a theory also about
who we are and what is this place in which we find ourselves called geometric unity.
The purpose of the portal, if you will, is to create a channel that has never existed.
Now, I could try to submit everything to Fizz review of letters. I could try to submit to
econometrica. I could try to go through all of the normal channels. I think what I've started to
realize is part of the problem of having screwed up all of this early stuff in our lives, of having
tried to do this the formal and right way, so to speak. The privilege of having been screwed over
so directly and so beautifully by this system is the right to raise the middle finger to the
institutions. How dare you expect that I'm going to use your quiet procedures? If you think about
what peer review is, it's the exact opposite of what peer review should mean. Peer review should
mean that you publish your article and then the peers in the community review it. But in fact,
what it is is peer suppression. You take your article and you mail it off to somebody who you
don't know. That person gets an early look at it. They might hold it up and review. They then
inflict any changes that they want or they reject it for reasons that make no sense and then it's
handed back to you. Now, why does it have such a positive spin? It's not long-standing in the
community. It doesn't seem to have a very long history, but it came out of an effort to quality
control new ideas. We wanted to know if new ideas were coming from reputable people. Were they using
reasonable methods? Were they reasonably familiar with their fields? In fact, that is the good
reason that we had this new technique of peer review. Previously, editors had been tasked with
being responsible for the field and figuring out whether or not something was up to snuff.
In this new situation, it was perfectly constructed for abuse. In fact, what you find is that it's
like what my brother refers to as the low-posted speed limit in a southern town. The key question
isn't peer review. It's how is it enforced for different people? That is, if you are a famous
professor who is well plugged into a journal where your friend is the editor, you're going to have an
entirely different experience with peer review than if you submit the exact same article coming
from some place that is not well known to that journal and in which there is a bias against
that group. For example, if I were to point out that every purebred dog in a kennel show is a
product of intelligent design, that is, that humans have commanded canines with whom and how they
can mate, that process has produced things like doxons and poodles. However, if I use words like
intelligent design, I guarantee you that even though it's clearly true that dogs are intelligently
designed, that that paper will be rejected because there is a belief that we should have a line which
says no paper on intelligent design has ever been accepted by a leading peer review journal.
Now, that political understanding of intelligent design has to do with both a reasonable idea
and an unreasonable idea. The reasonable idea is that you should not be able to smuggle Jesus
into evolutionary theory. You should not be able to do young earth creationism inside of a scientific
context. That is the previous reasonable version of peer review. It makes sense as quality control.
But what happens when you start talking about perception mediated selection? For example,
pseudo-copulation in orchids, which we've discussed before, or in the predatory system
with the muscle lampicillus, where the perception of the bass matters because it thinks that it's
consuming a baitfish, but in fact that's a fake baitfish filled with the young of the muscle.
In both of those cases, you have perception mediated selection, and you could make an argument
that that should be called intelligent design. But those magic words can't appear in that journal.
Why? For a political reason. So what we have is we've created a system based around quality control
that in fact is rife and open for abuse. In that system, we now have to realize that we need other
channels. We need an ability to route around. We need to be able to reinsert dissidents and people
who do not get along with institutions back inside of the institutions. If you look at Noam Chomsky
sitting at MIT, you will realize that it was once the case that such people were much more common.
You can look up a fellow, an old friend of mine named Serge Lang, and you could scarcely believe
that such a person could have existed at Yale, but that person very much did exist. You can look at
an old controversy about David Baltimore and a woman named Margot O'Toole and the courage of
Mark Ptashny and Walter Gilbert in fighting a Nobel laureate when Margot O'Toole accused a
colleague of the Nobel laureate of misconduct or at least irreproducibility of results.
We have a long and storied history that has gone wildly off the rails with the crisis in
current sense-making. The purpose of the portal was always to set up a channel by which we would
have enough people watching that we could attempt to keep people from being rolled in the alleys
when they contradicted the institutions. That is, in large measure, what we're here to do.
If you look at our episode with Timor Karan, we introduced you to a concept of preference
falsification. Right now, the danger of the Andrew Yang and the Jeffrey Epstein situations
is that they have conveniently communicated to many people, of course we're going to mess with
your sense-making. What is it you're prepared to do about it? This brings us to a final issue,
which I think is incredibly important, which has to do with why there are no living heroes.
In effect, we almost don't believe in heroism. As soon as somebody starts to make us excited
about the world and what is possible for the individual, we come to start feeling terrible
about that person unless they're trapped inside of a Marvel movie or something like that.
If you go back to the history of ticker tape parades, you will see that there were many
ticker tape parades given for individual aviators, individual explorers, ships captains who put their
ship at risk to rescue the crew of another. In fact, this pattern largely stopped.
My contention is that the difficult case of Charles Lindbergh may have marked
a turning point. In Lindbergh's case, he had flown solo to Europe from the United States and come
back a hero, I believe in the late 1920s. Lindbergh was a very difficult human being to deal with
because he was an authentic hero and he was also somebody who believed in America first and in
isolationism. Given the Nazi menace in Europe, I think that's almost an unforgivable position.
Nevertheless, the fact is that Lindbergh commanded tremendous popularity. That popularity
could have been used to keep the US out of a war. What I find is that since Lindbergh,
it has been very rare to elevate any individual to the point where they can oppose our institutions.
Pete Seegers and Albert Einstein's of the world who fought against McCarthyism were a huge danger
to the industry that was cropping up around anti-communism. When it came to the Vietnam
War, it was very dangerous to have popular entertainers like John Lennon who were against it.
We have been frightened about individuals coming to rival our institutions in terms of power. That's
what's so great about the New Revolution and long-form podcasting and all of these other forms
of social media. We have a great danger in that most of these platforms are mediated. We saw what
happened to Alex Jones. It's quite possible that if these powerful institutions come to believe
that a particular individual should be removed, they can always choose to enforce the rules in
a different way. We saw recently the advent of terms of service changes to include dead naming.
If I say that Walter Carlos composed the album Switched on Bach or performed the album Switched
on Bach, that is a true statement. But because Walter Carlos became Wendy Carlos, I have no idea
whether or not I can be accused of dead naming. Imagine that you have 100 such rules, rules that
are never spelled out, never clear, that can be enforced any which way to deny someone access to
the major platforms. This is the great danger with this moment. We have unprecedented access,
but we also have a gating function which can be turned on at any time if we fall out of line with
the institutions. I want to read you one tweet that has been on my mind for quite some time.
This tweet came from a contributor to The Washington Post who's a professor at the Fletcher
School. It said, good morning, Eric. I'm going to leave out the parentheses. I've read up on a few
of your notions and I have some thoughts, but my basic conclusion is simple. What's true isn't new
and what's new isn't true. I think it's fantastic. I was stung by it because at first I was under
the impression that we were still living in a world in which The Washington Post, New York Times,
Harvard, Stanford, what have you, control the major conversation. But coming off of a recent
date at the Ice House in Pasadena, which was a live gig with Peter Thiel, I've started to realize
how powerful this new movement is. We can reach anyone anywhere. What I now believe is that the
gated institutional narrative has been spoiling for a fight. We are quickly coming to the point
where we have a David and Goliath moment. We now need to try to reinflict the individuals who are
uncorrelated, who are not particularly good at taking orders, who don't like committee meetings,
who don't want to sign loyalty oaths, but who are passionately committed to the public good and to
some version of intellectual meta-honesty. We need these people to once again take up positions
inside of the institutions. And I would like to, in fact, inflict myself on my favorite institution,
Harvard University. The children of Harvard University have always been divided into white
sheep and black sheep. And there's no question that I represent black sheep Harvard. But I also
think that one of the features of the university that makes it great is that it has tolerated
both its white sheep and its black sheep. It is time to do battle with the oppressive structures
that have been used to silence new ideas. If in my family, I assert that there might be as many
as three revolutionary Nobel quality ideas in one clutch, how many ideas might there be suppressed
if that is actually true? How many people are sitting on top of intellectual gold that never
got its chance to see the light of day? What I'd like to do is to try to do battle with the disc,
to show you that it exists, to try to figure out how it works, and to try to show that the
tools that we currently have may be powerful enough to defeat it. This is the actual purpose
of the portal. And I think even if we lose some viewers and some listeners, even if people
start to see articles appearing that say how terrible the show is and how it's trying to
foment some kind of unrest, to hell with them. We are in an amazing position to try to do something
new and to stand up for a lot of people who may have given up on their own original ideas
and to try to spark a revolution. Because if I'm right, the disc has been sitting up
on top of some of our best and most hopeful ideas for a way out of our economic condendrums,
our military problems, ideas which have some chance of delivering us to a much more interesting
and brighter tomorrow. So I hope that this is going to be an unbelievable decade. Thank you guys
for sticking with it. I'm sorry if this was a little bit long, but it was a lot to say and it
was heartfelt and quite important to me to get it out. And we will return to trying to get you
high quality content either in the form of interviews which you've become used to on the portal,
or perhaps some new visual content that allows you to understand ideas that would be very difficult
to communicate, but for some novel means of presentation. We hope to approach the community
to try to coordinate people who are eager to contribute back into the program
and maybe get a little bit of a closer relationship to our content going forward,
maybe influence it a little bit. And we haven't figured out all of the bugs. So thanks for being
part of the initial experiment. Thanks for sticking with us and we're looking forward to being with
you in the coming year and decade ahead. So you've been through the portal for our first solo episode
of 2020 and be well everybody. Stay tuned.
