So there's a new movie called Air. It's about a Nike marketing executive, Sonny Vakara,
played by Matt Damon, and how he pushed Nike to create an entire line of shoes around Michael
Jordan, the Air Jordans, in 1984. This isn't a biopic of an entrepreneur or an athlete or a company.
It might be the first biopic of a brand. Biopic. Biopic. Okay. Brands are something that I've always
been interested in both as someone who just wants to understand the world better, but also as a
comedy writer, because brands are extremely funny to me. Like somewhere in the world right now,
a conference room full of marketing executives is trying to figure out how to project an identity
and values for a product called like dumpy diapers. But as ridiculous as they are, brands have
infiltrated our culture so deeply that the highest level of achievement in our society is to completely
fuse with capitalism and become a living, breathing brand. To be Rihanna slash Fenty,
or Dr. Dre slash Beats, or Jordan Peterson slash loneliness. And the original celebrity brand,
the first person that everyone wanted to be like, was Mike. Oh, Jordan. Michael Jordan.
And Air tells the story of how Michael Jordan became Air Jordan. But the real story of how
Nike created that brand and how they revolutionized the modern corporation is way more interesting
and less flattering to Nike and its CEO Phil Knight than the story this film tells. That story
was first told in a hugely influential book called No Logo. Through a combination of investigative
reporting and brilliant analysis, it explained exactly how Nike and other brands came to latch
onto our culture and consume it like a cool, refreshing Heineken. Open your world.
No Logo made its author Naomi Klein an intellectual rock star at the age of 29. One of the biggest
rock bands in the world at the time, Radiohead, actually considered naming one of their albums
No Logo. It's about the invasion of your ideas and your emotions and your feelings. They ended
up calling it Kid A instead, but it's hard to overstate how influential this book was to an
entire generation of people. That popularity was partly due to good timing. Just days before
the book was released on November 30th, 1999, a massive protest began at the World Trade Organization
Summit in Seattle called the Battle of Seattle. Tens of thousands of protesters were bombarded
with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, and the city declared a state of emergency.
Frazier and Niles Crane were utterly aghast. Today, this kind of protest would barely make
the news, but at the time, it blew people's minds. They were like, protest? Why would anyone
protest? It's the 90s. Everything is great. Have you heard the New Hoodie and the Blowfish album?
It's fine. Most young people in the 90s had never even seen a protest in real life, and nobody
had seen a protest like this. People were rejecting an economic order, which, up until that point,
had been widely accepted as much like Hoodie and the Blowfish. Fine. So suddenly, everyone
wanted to understand where all this outrage was coming from, and no logo provided the answer.
I didn't read this book for the first time until 2016, and I reread it recently. And while the parts
documenting the anti-corporate resistance movement were interesting, I want to focus on Klein's
analyses of multinational corporations and their brands. Because the company she used as her main
case study to help readers understand the marketing first workers last business model that took over
in the 90s, and that led to the Battle of Seattle was Nike. So using Naomi Klein as my intellectual
GPS and no logo as one giant citation for this whole video, I'm going to talk about how brands
became so powerful, how Nike helped pioneer this expanded role that brands would play in our economy
and our culture, and why Air is the perfect title for this movie for reasons that have
nothing to do with basketball. So brands, as we know them now, didn't really show up until the
late 19th century. Back then, if you wanted some sugar or flour, you'd go to the local general
store, tell the shopkeeper what you needed, and he would scoop it out of barrels, hopefully not
with his hands. But when mass production started in the 1880s, companies had a problem. Their products
were all really similar to each other. So if they wanted to sell more, they had to stand out.
And that's when companies discovered the first rule of advertising. The more similar products
are to each other, the more important it is for you to fool people into thinking they're actually
different. So along with manufacturing products, companies started manufacturing brands so people
could tell them apart. So you had Heinz Ketchup and Hellman's mayonnaise and Grandpa MacDougall's
soothing syrup, now with extra opium. These brands allowed companies to cut the shopkeepers out of
the equation and communicate directly with a customer. But in the mid 1980s, some companies took
this a step further. They realized that people weren't really buying their product as much as
they were buying their brand. So why not take the product out of the equation completely,
and just sell the brand? And the company that led the shift to this new type of corporation that
outsourced the making of its products and instead focused completely on marketing
was Nike. In the time period when air takes place in the mid 80s, Nike wasn't some scrappy startup.
Its CEO, Phil Knight, was already extremely rich. He started selling running shoes in the 60s and
cashed in on the jogging craze in the 70s. But by the mid 80s, everybody stopped jogging, probably
because their knees hurt, and the running shoe market dried up. Nike needed to reinvent itself.
So Phil Knight decided that instead of being a running shoe company,
Nike would become a brand factory where shoes were just the raw material for the real product,
the brand. He said, there's no value in making things anymore. The value is added by careful
research by innovation and by marketing. But how does that work? How do you create value from just
pure marketing? What is marketing worth in actual dollars? That was an open question until 1988.
That year, Philip Morris bought Kraft for $13 billion, six times more than the company was
worth on paper, which means the word Kraft was valued at over $10 billion. So just the synapses
firing in millions of people's brains, recognizing the word Kraft and having certain feelings about
that word was worth over $10 billion, which was proof that this marketing first model worked.
Ads were no longer just a way to sell more stuff. They could increase the value of your company.
The more you spent on ads, the more your brand was worth. So Nike and other multinational corporations
completely reoriented themselves towards marketing. And that process involved three steps that had an
enormous impact on our economy and our culture and our politics in ways that are still felt to this
day. The first step was to close the American factories and outsource manufacturing to contractors
and subcontractors in the global south, whose only job was to make stuff as cheaply as possible.
That meant a boom in sweatshops. And we all know this part of the story. People living in low-income
countries around the world are paid starvation wages in horrible conditions to make clothing for
people living in richer countries who try not to think about it. In the early 90s, most people
were still genuinely ignorant about sweatshops, but that all changed in 1996. After years of
activists trying to raise awareness of child labor being used by American corporations overseas,
Life magazine published a report that featured this photo of the Pakistani boys sewing Nike
soccer balls. And everyone freaked out. Anti-sweatshop protests swept across college campuses calling
out companies by name. The New York Times called it the biggest surge in campus activism in nearly
two decades. Phil Knight was suddenly a villain, and Michael Moore was showing up at his office
offering him a free trip to Indonesia. But at the end of the day, Phil's friends circled the wagons.
Bill Clinton made him part of a toothless White House task force on sweatshops, and academics
like Jeffrey Sachs, famous economist and Bono Ride or Die, argued that companies like Nike were
basically engaged in a giant poverty reduction program. He said,
My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops, but that there are too few.
Those are precisely the jobs that was stepping stones for Singapore and Hong Kong, and those
are the jobs that have to come to Africa to get them out of backbreaking rural poverty.
Yeah, it's not like companies want to abduct Africans and enslave them. They just want to
give Africans the opportunity to be slaves in the comfort of their own continent.
So Nike moved its operations from country to country, leaving a trail of sweat and union
crackdowns in its wake. While back in America, they moved on to step two of their new business model.
Once Nike and other multinationals laid off most of their workers,
they could put all that money they saved into perfecting their brands, which was a very different
business. These companies weren't making products anymore, they were making images,
and they had to infuse those images of cola or coffee or margarine with some kind of meaning that
their customers would feel an emotional connection to. This made the job of marketers way more
difficult. Before the late 80s, if you wanted to sell something, you just had to come up with a
catchy jingle, maybe a cute cartoon character. But now these poor marketing executives were
sent on a quest to find their corporate soul, to find a deep spiritual meaning in like snack
cakes. And every corporation started sounding like it just got back from a backpacking trip to
Nepal. Nike didn't sell shoes anymore, it sold the idea of transcendence through sports. IBM
didn't sell computers, it sold business solutions. And Gillette was no longer just a razor, it was
an experience of confidence and power that you could hold in your actual hand. But also just a
razor. Understandably, this process of trying to find meaning in meaninglessness broke the
brains of marketing executives. They lost touch with reality completely and got brand brain.
Here's a quote from brand brain sufferer and former head of marketing at Nike, Scott Bedbury.
A great brand raises a bar. It adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience. Whether it's
the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of
coffee you're drinking really matters. What does any of that mean? The cup of coffee you're drinking
will never, ever matter. Unless you're defusing a bomb and somehow the adrenaline just isn't
enough to keep you awake and you need that extra pick me up to keep going. Maybe then. Maybe. You
see other tragic examples of brand brain all the time. Like that room full of staples executives
who stood and applauded for the big reveal of their company's new logo, which was a staple. Or that
Bank of America marketer who wrote and performed an earnest ode to a new credit card to the tune of
U2's one. I'll read some lyrics since the music might infringe on YouTube's copyright and I'm
already dangerously heavy on Bono in this video. And it's one bank, one card, one name that's known
all over the world, one spirit. We get to share it, leading us to higher standards. Ooh. So one
step two was complete and the company created a brand so powerful that just slapping it onto
something would infuse it with meaning. It was time to slap it on everything they could.
Remember from the craft example, ads aren't just about increasing sales anymore. They're an
investment. The more you advertise, the more your company is worth. So in the 90s, brands started
showing up in places that they never were before, like music festivals and stadiums. Banana stickers
were advertising movies. Colleges signed contracts with soda companies to put sponsored vending machines
on campus. And campus athletics departments all over the US signed sponsorship deals with Nike.
But it went way further and deeper. Brands became culture vampires, sucking the soul out of everything
that was good and cool to add value to themselves. They co-opted fashion, music and nostalgia. They
co-opted whole identities like feminist. And brands didn't just co-opt culture, they co-opted
counterculture. Sprite's obey your thirst slogan was a riff on anti-corporate graffiti. More recently,
we've seen brands trying to co-opt social justice movements, like when Kendall Jenner solved police
violence with high-fructose corn syrup. Now, there was a huge backlash to that Kendall Jenner ad,
but the vast, vast majority of branding happens with little to no pushback. Why is that? No logo
suggested that it's partly due to the fact that corporate brands are filling a social vacuum that
they themselves helped create. Throughout the 80s and 90s, the pro-free market political consensus
hollowed out the public sphere. Jobs moved overseas, inequality widened, and public schools
deteriorated. So with fewer public funds for, say, after-school sports programs, Nike could step in
and sponsor its own programs and plaster its logo all over them. And with a smaller tax base for,
say, basic municipal services, KFC could literally fill in potholes and label them refreshed by KFC.
That actually happened, and the most offensive part to me
is the use of the word refreshed. KFC does not refresh. At best, it engorges. At worst,
E. Colise. But we haven't just lost public services over the last several decades. We've
also lost public spaces. And brands have tried to exploit our nostalgia and longing for those
lost spaces. Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose name on screen here was spelled
by a Starbucks barista, said his company's customers are there for more than just the coffee.
It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in
Starbucks stores. Now it's true that people do have a genuine hunger for warmth and community,
but corporations like Starbucks are terrible at providing them. Because actual warm welcoming
community spaces don't charge you $10 to drink a small burnt coffee next to a tinny speaker
blasting Ed Sheeran. That Howard Schultz quote about recreating a feeling of community
reminded me of a mall in Los Angeles called the Americana at Brand. The whole place is a replica
of an old fashioned town square. Everything is spotless. There's even a chandelier for some
reason. And an old timey streetcar where a tour guide points out local mom and pop establishments
like the Samsung Galaxy Papa. Obviously, it's not a real town square. It's not a public space.
It's private property. And that's a crucial distinction because in a public space, you can
say or do anything within the confines of the law. But on private property, you can only say or do
what's permitted by its owner. You can't hold a climate change protest at Americana at Brand.
You can't hold a union rally inside of a Starbucks. You can't actually participate
in culture in these places. You can't talk back. It's a one way conversation. And now, of course,
our community spaces are online and so suffocated by brands that they can cut us out of the conversation
completely and just talk directly to each other. Like when Sunny D implied that it wanted to unalive
itself and other brands reached out to help. Just for your reference, I asked chat GBT what you
should do if a brand you love becomes suicidal. It suggested encouraging the brand to seek help,
being a supportive listener. And most importantly, remembering that while you may feel a strong
connection to a brand, ultimately their well being is not your responsibility. So simply
dominating all cultural and public and online spaces was never enough for brands. Remember,
they're selling meaning. And what's the main competition if you're selling meaning? Religion.
And this is where Nike's boldest innovation happened because they decided to compete directly
with religion by creating a God. And they did it by following a very classic paint by numbers
mythical formula, a man who could fly. Early Air Jordan ads explicitly tried to create this
illusion that he could defy gravity. Air Jordans weren't just shoes. They were a portal to a
higher plane of existence. Nike's flagship store in midtown Manhattan is right across the street
from a cathedral, which seems appropriate because it feels like a religious pilgrimage site. It's
full of inspirational quotes and glass cases with hunks of polyurethane encased inside like
they're the bones of saints. And what's interesting is that this store and probably all of the big
brand flagship stores in midtown Manhattan lose money. This is some of the most expensive store
front real estate on the planet. And these stores don't move nearly enough merchandise to pay for
it. But the point of these stores isn't direct sales. They're meant to increase the value of
the brand by making a statement about how big and important it is. They imprint an experience on
the people that visit and inspire a devotion to the brand. Unfortunately for Nike, turning itself
into a religion with Michael Jordan as its god had a downside because this god had agents who
negotiated non exclusivity. So when Michael Jordan's fame and power outgrew Nike, it lost control of him.
And if there was a distinct moment that signaled this loss of control, it was the 1996 release of
the movie Space Jam, which was essentially a feature length ad for a super brand called Michael
Jordan. The director of Space Jam and part time Norwegian grave digger Joe Pidka has been very open
about this. There's nothing more than a long commercial. They paid for the movie three times
with the licensing fees before that we rolled an inch of film. Over 200 companies licensed Space Jam
merch, which annoyed Nike because they thought it would water down the Air Jordan brand. Nike
didn't want to share the spotlight. It wanted to be the star. And the amazing thing is brands seem
to have learned from that experience. And today they've co-opted the whole concept of movie stardom.
The biggest movie star in the world right now isn't an actor. It's a brand, Marvel. Remember ads
increase the value of a brand and Marvel movies are advertisements for the Marvel brand. So even
if a Marvel movie breaks even if the exposure it gets increases the value of the Marvel brand,
it's still profitable to the company that owns Marvel, Disney. And similarly, even though the
film Air wasn't created by Nike, it will add value to the Nike brand because they perfected
this magic trick of conjuring value out of nothing. Nike makes most of its money out of air. I personally
don't think the transformation of Michael Jordan into a brand deserves to be celebrated as some
great act of ingenuity. And the whole idea of fetishizing a basic commodity is, to me, dumb.
But as Naomi Klein made clear at the end of no logo, the criticisms of corporations like Nike
were never really about the brands. Brands are a symbol of the injustices of the global economy.
That's what anti-corporate protests were and continue to be about. The brands were only the
music. The truth was in the lyrics.
