Tonight, I'd like to tell you about one of the big questions in science.
It's a question that goes back at least two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks,
and it's a question that has been discussed in this room many, many times over the past
200 years, but it's an important question, and I think it's important that we revisit it.
The question is simply this, what are we made of? What are the fundamental building blocks of
nature that you and me and everything else in the universe are constructed for? That's the story
I'd like to tell you. What I'd like to do is try and give you an overview of our current
understanding. I'd also like to try and give you an overview of where we hope to go in the future,
of what progress we can hope to make in the next few years and few decades, and we're going to cover
quite a lot of ground in this talk. I should warn you now, not least because I'm going to discuss
every single thing in the universe quite literally. We're going to talk, amongst other things, about
what's happening at the world's most powerful particle collider. This is a machine that's
called the Large Hadron Collider, or the LHC for short. It'll come up a lot in this talk,
and it's a machine which is based underground in a place called CERN, which is just outside Geneva.
We'll also talk about experiments in the last few years that look backwards in time
towards the Big Bang that give us some understanding about what was happening in the first few
fractions of a second after time itself started to exist. On top of all this, I also want to give
you some idea about the theoretical abstract ideas and even a little bit idea about the mathematics
that underlies our current understanding of the universe, because I'm a theoretical physicist. What
I do is study the equations, try to understand the equations that govern the world we live in,
and so I'd just like to give you a flavor of what that's about. At some point, I should warn you
now, at some point, I'm even going to show you an equation. You can get sent on training courses
for this kind of thing. There's a number one rule. The number one rule is never show the many
equations. If you show them equations, you'll just terrify them. At some point in this lecture,
you're all going to be terrified, so just prepare yourselves. There's a traditional way to start
talks like this. The traditional way is to be very cultured and talk about what democracies and
Lucretias said two and a half thousand years ago and the ideas that the ancient Greeks had about
atoms. I don't want to start like this. We've made a lot of progress in two and a half thousand years
and there's just better places to kick off a science talk. The first modern picture that we had
of what the universe is made of, everything we're made of, is this. I hope this is familiar to
most people here. This is the periodic table of elements. It's one of the most iconic images in
all of science. What we have here are 120-ish different elements. I should point out no less
than 10 of which were discovered in this very building and which constitute, or at least in the
1800s, were thought to constitute everything that existed in nature. It's certainly true that any
material you get, you can distill it down into its component parts and you'll find that all of those
component parts are made of one of these 120 elements. It's a great moment in science. It's
really one of the triumphs of science. It's also, I should add, the reason that I stopped doing
chemistry in school. Because if you're a chemist, this is basically as good as it gets. If we're
honest, it's kind of a mess. Everything in the universe is classified into things on the left
that go bang if you put them in water, things on the right which really, if we're honest,
don't do very much at all. You kind of organise everything into this stupid shape. It looks a
little bit like Australia. There's a big dip in the top and then there's these two strips of elements
that you have to put along the bottom because there's no room for them in the middle where they
belong. I don't know about you. If I was asked to come up with a fundamental classification of
everything in the universe, this isn't what I would have gone for. Are there any chemists in the
audience? I'm sorry for you. I'm not alone in this. It's not just me that thinks this is a silly way
to organise nature. Nature itself thinks this is a silly way to organise nature. Of course, we know
this isn't the fundamental, this isn't the end of the story. This isn't the fundamental building
blocks. The first person to realise there's something deeper than this was a Cambridge physicist
called JJ Thompson. At the end of the 1800s, JJ Thompson discovered a particle that was smaller
than an atom that we now call the electron. In 1897, he announced this in this room, in fact,
in this very lecture series, to a stunned audience, an audience that was so stunned that at least
half of them didn't believe what he was saying. There was one very distinguished scientist who
afterwards told JJ Thompson, he thought the whole thing was a hoax, that JJ Thompson had just been
pulling their leg. Of course, it's not a hoax. This isn't the fundamental elements of nature.
Within 15 years of JJ Thompson's discovery, his successor in Cambridge, a man called Ernest
Rutherford, had figured out exactly what these atoms are made of. This is the picture that
Rutherford came up with. We now know that each of these elements consists of a nucleus,
which is tiny. The metaphor that Rutherford himself used was it's like a fly in the centre of the
cathedral. Then, orbiting this nucleus in, I should add, fairly blurry orbits are the electrons,
which fill out very sparsely the rest of the space. That's our picture of these atoms.
Subsequently, we learned that the nucleus is not itself fundamental. The nucleus contains
smaller particles. They're particles that we call protons and neutrons. In the 1970s,
we learned that the protons and neutrons aren't fundamental either. In the 1970s,
we learned that inside each proton and neutron are three smaller particles that we call quarks.
There are two different kinds of quarks. By the 1970s, I'm guessing physicists didn't
have a classical Greek education, and they'd run out of classy names. We call these quarks
the up-quark and the down-quark, for no good reason. It's not like the up-quark is higher
than the down-quark. It's not like it points up. It's no good reason at all. The up-quark and the
down-quark. The proton consists of two up-quarks and a down-quark. The neutron consists of two
down-quarks and an up-quark. This, as far as we know, are the fundamental building blocks
of nature. We've never discovered anything smaller than the electron, and we've never
discovered anything smaller than the quarks. We have three particles of which everything we know
is made. It's worth stressing. That's kind of astonishing. We sort of take it for granted.
We learn this in school. We don't really think about it deeply. Everything we see in the world,
all the diversity in the natural world, you, me, everything around us, we're just the same
three particles with slightly different rearrangements repeated over and over and over again.
It's an amazing lesson to draw about how the world is put together.
So that's what we have. We have an electron and two quarks.
These aren't the fundamental building blocks that the Greeks had thought about, and they're
certainly not the fundamental building blocks that the Victorians had thought about, but the spirit
of the issue really hasn't changed. The spirit is exactly what Democrisus said 2,500 years ago.
There are like LEGO bricks from which everything in the world is constructed. These LEGO bricks
are particles, and the particles are the electron and two quarks. It's a very nice picture. It's
a very comforting picture. It's the picture we teach kids at school. It's the picture we even
teach our students in undergraduate university. And there's a problem with it. The problem is,
it's a lie. It's a white lie. It's a white lie that we tell our children because we don't want to
expose them to the difficult and horrible truth too early on. It makes it easier to learn if you
believe that these particles are the fundamental building blocks of the universe, but it's simply
not true. The best theories that we have of physics do not have underlying them the quark
particle and the electron particle and the two quark particles. In fact, the very best theories
we have of physics don't rely on particles at all. The best theories we have tell us that the
fundamental building blocks of nature are not particles, but something much more nebulous
and abstract. The fundamental building blocks of nature are fluid-like substances which are spread
throughout the entire universe and ripple in strange and interesting ways. That's the fundamental
reality in which we live. These fluid-like substances we have a name for. We call them fields.
So this is a picture of a field. This isn't the kind of field that physicists have in mind.
This is what you think a field is if you're a farmer or you're a normal person. If you're a
physicist you have a very different picture in your mind when you think about fields. I'll tell you
the general definition of a field and then we'll go through some examples so that you get familiar
with this. The physicist's definition of a field is the following. It's something that, as I said,
is spread everywhere throughout the universe. It's something that takes a particular value
at every point in space and what's more that value can change in time. The picture to having
your mind is a fluid which ripples and sways throughout the universe. Now it's not a new
idea. It's not an idea that we've just come up with. It's an idea which dates back almost 200
years and like so many other things in science it's an idea which originated in this very room.
As I'm sure many of you are aware this is the home of Michael Faraday. Michael Faraday
initiated this lecture series in 1825. He gave over a hundred of these Friday evening discourses
and the vast majority of these were on his own discoveries on the experiments he did
on electricity and magnetism. He did many, many things in electricity and magnetism over many
decades and in doing so he built up an intuition for how electric and magnetic phenomena work
and the intuition is what we now call the electric and magnetic field. What he envisaged
was that it's threaded everywhere throughout space with these invisible objects called the
electric and magnetic fields. Now we learn this in school. Again it's something that we sort of
take for granted because we learn at an early age and we don't appreciate just how big of a
radical step this idea of Faraday is. I want to stress it's one of the most revolutionary
abstract ideas in the history of science that these electric and magnetic fields exist.
Let me just, you're supposed to do demonstrations in this and I'm not just a theoretical physicist,
I'm a very theoretical physicist. It's very hard for me to do any kind of experiment that's going
to work but I'm just going to show you something that you've all seen. They're magnets and we all
played these games when we were kids or when we were in school. You take these magnets and you move
them together and as they get closer and closer there's this force that you can just feel building up
that pushes the pressure that pushes against these two magnets and it doesn't matter how often you
do it, it doesn't matter how many degrees you have in physics, it's just a little bit magical.
And you all know this, there's something just special about this weird feeling that you get
between magnets. And this was Faraday's genius. It was to appreciate that even though you can't
see anything in between, even though no matter how closely you look the space between these
magnets will seem to be empty, he said nonetheless there's something real there. There's something
real and physical which is invisible but is building up and that's what's responsible for the force.
He called them lines of force, we now call it the magnetic field. So this of course is a picture
of Michael Faraday. This is a picture of Michael Faraday lecturing behind this very table. Here is
a drawing from one of Michael Faraday's papers. It was pointed out to me earlier when you leave
there's a carpet just here. The carpet has this pattern, this picture just repeated on it over
and over and over again. On the bottom here is one of Michael Faraday's most famous demonstrations
that he did here. So I'll just walk you through what Faraday did. The thing on the right, there's
a small coil with a hand on it. This is a battery and the battery passes a current around this coil
and in doing so there's a magnetic field that's induced in this. It's what's called a solenoid
and then Faraday did the following thing. He simply moved this small coil A through this big coil B
like this and something miraculous happened. When you do that there's a moving magnetic field,
Faraday's great discovery was induction. It gives rise to a current in B which then over on this end
of the table makes a needle flicker like this. So extremely simple. You move a magnetic field
and it gives rise to a current which makes a needle flicker on the other side of the table.
This astounded audience is in the 1800s because you were doing something and affecting the needle
on the other end of the table yet you never touched the needle. It was amazing. You could
make something move without ever going near it, without ever touching it. We kind of jaded these
days. You can do the same experiment. You can pick out your cell phone, you can press a few
buttons, you can call somebody on the other end of the earth within seconds. But it's the same
principle but this was the first time it was demonstrated that the field is real. You can
communicate using the field. You can affect things far away using the field without ever touching it.
So this is Michael Faraday's legacy. It's that there's not just particles in the world. There's
other objects that are slightly more subtle, that are called fields, that are spread throughout
all of space. But by the way, if you ever want to really appreciate the genius of Michael Faraday,
he gave this lecture in 1846, he gave many lectures in 1846, but there was one in particular where
he finished 20 minutes early. He ran out of things to say. So he engaged in some idle speculation
for 20 minutes. Faraday suggested that these invisible electric and magnetic fields that
he'd postulated were quite literally the only thing we've ever seen. He suggested that it's
ripples of the electric and magnetic field, which is what we call light. So it took, of course,
50 years for people like Maxwell and Hertz to confirm that this is indeed what light is made of,
but it was Faraday's genius that appreciated this, that there are waves in the electric,
magnetic field and those waves are the light that we see around us. Okay, so this is Faraday's legacy,
but it turns out this idea of fields was much more important than Faraday had realized,
and it took over 150 years for us to appreciate the importance of these fields.
So what happened in these 150 years was that there was a small revolution in science.
In the 1920s, we realized that the world is very, very different from the common sense ideas that
Newton and Galileo had handed down to us centuries before. So in the 1920s, people like Heisenberg
and Schrodinger realized that on the smallest scales, on the microscopic scales, the world
is much more mysterious and counterintuitive than we ever really imagined it could be. This,
of course, is the theory that we now know as quantum mechanics. So there's a lot I could say
about quantum mechanics. Let me tell you one of the punchlines of quantum mechanics. One of the
punchlines is that energy isn't continuous. Energy in the world is always parceled up into
some little discrete lump. Okay, that's actually what the word quantum means. Quantum means discrete
or lumpy. So the real fun starts when you try and take the ideas of quantum mechanics, which say
that things should be discrete, and you try to combine them with Faraday's ideas of fields,
which are very much continuous smooth objects, which are waving and oscillating in space.
So the idea of trying to combine these two theories together is what we call quantum field theory.
And here's the implication of quantum field theory. The first implication is what happens
for the electric and magnetic field. So Faraday taught us and Maxwell later that waves of the
electromagnetic field are what we call light. But when you apply quantum mechanics to this,
you find that these light waves aren't quite as smooth and continuous as they appeared. So if
you look closely at light waves, you'll find that they're made of particles. They're little
particles of light, and these are particles that we call the photon. The magic of this idea is that
same principle applies to every single other particle in the universe. So there is spread
everywhere throughout this room something that we call the electron field. It's like a fluid
that fills this room and in fact fills the entire universe. And the ripples of this electron fluid,
the ripples of the waves of this fluid get tied into little bundles of energy by the rules of
quantum mechanics. And those bundles of energy are what we call the particle, the electron.
All the electrons that are in your body are not fundamental. All the electrons that exist in
your body are waves of the same underlying field. We're all connected to each other. It's like
the waves on the ocean all belong to the same underlying ocean. The electrons in your body
are the ripples of the same field as the electrons in my body. There's more than this. There's also
in this room two quark fields, and the ripples of these two quark fields give rise to what we call
the up quark and the down quark. And the same is true for every other kind of particle in the
universe. There are fields that underlie everything, and what we think of as particles
aren't really particles at all. They're waves of these fields tied up into little bundles of energy.
So this is the legacy of Faraday. This is where Faraday's vision of
fields has taken us. There are no particles in the world. The basic fundamental building blocks
of our universe are these fluid-like substances that we call fields.
All right.
Okay. So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you where that vision takes us.
I want to tell you about what it means that we're not made of particles. We're made of fields.
And I want to tell you what we can do with that and how we can best understand the universe around
us. Okay. So here's the first thing. Take a box and take every single thing that exists out of that
box. Take all the particles out the box, all the atoms out the box. What you're left with is a pure
vacuum. And this is what the vacuum looks like. So what you're looking at here is a computer
simulation using our best theory of physics. It's something called the Standard Model, which I'll
introduce later. But it's a computer simulation of absolutely nothing. This is empty space,
literally empty space with nothing in it. This is the simplest thing you could possibly imagine
in the universe. And you can see it's an interesting place to be, empty space. It's not dull and
boring. What you're looking at here is that even when the particles are taken out, the field still
exists. The field is there. But what's more, the field is governed by the rules of quantum mechanics.
And there's a principle in quantum mechanics, which is called the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, which says you're not allowed to sit still. And the field has to obey this. So even
when there's nothing else there, the field is constantly bubbling and fluctuating in what's
quite honestly a very complicated way. These are things that we call quantum vacuum fluctuations.
But this is what nothingness looks like from the perspective of our current theories of physics.
Okay, it's worth saying that this is a computer simulation. It looks a little bit like a cartoon,
but it's actually quite a powerful computer simulation that took a long time to do. But
these aren't just theoretical. These quantum fluctuations that are there in the pure vacuum
are things that we can measure. There's something called the Casimir force. The Casimir force is
a force between two metal plates that get pushed together basically because there's more of this
stuff on the outside than on the inside. And you know, these are real. These are things that we
can measure and they behave just as we would predict they would from our theories. So this
is nothing. And this brings me to the more mathematical side of the talk because there's
a challenge in this. This is the simplest thing we can imagine in the entire universe. And it's
complicated. Okay, it's astonishingly complicated. And it doesn't get easier than this. You know,
if you want to now understand not nothing but a single particle, well, that's much more complicated
than this. And if you want to understand 10 to the 23 particles all doing something interesting,
that's really, really much more complicated than this. So there's a problem in my problem,
not yours, in addressing this fundamental description of the universe, which is that it's
just hard. Okay, the mathematics that we use to describe quantum fields, to describe everything
that we're made of in terms of quantum fields is substantially more difficult than the maths that
arises in any other area of physics or science. Okay, it's genuinely difficult. I can put this in
some perspective. There's a list of six open problems in mathematics. They're considered
to be the six hardest problems in mathematics. There used to be seven, but some crazy Russian
guys solved one of them. So there's six left. You win a million bucks if you can solve any one
of these problems. If you know a little bit of mathematics, they're things like the Riemann
hypothesis or P versus NP, and they're sort of famously difficult problems. This is one of those
six problems. You win a million dollars if you can understand this. So what does it mean? It doesn't
mean can you build a big computer and just demonstrate that these are there. It means can you understand
from first principles by solving the equations the patterns that emerge within these quantum
fluctuations. It's an extraordinarily difficult problem. It's right in the kind of thing I do.
I don't know a single person in the world who's actually working on this problem. That's how
hard it is. We don't really even know how to begin to start understanding these kind of ideas in
quantum field theory. This theme about the mathematics being challenging is something
which is going to come back later in the talk. So I'd like just to take a little bit of a
diversion for a few minutes and give you a sense about what we can do mathematically and what we
can't do mathematically. Just sort of tell you what the state of play is in terms of understanding
these theories called quantum field theories which underlie our universe. So there are times
where we understand extremely well what's going on with quantum fields and that happens
basically when these fluctuations are very calm and tame, when they're not wild and strong. These
ones are big but when they're much more calmer, when the vacuum is much more like a mill pond than
it is like a raging storm. In those cases we really think we understand what we're doing
and to illustrate this I just want to give you this example. So this number G is a particular
property of the electron particle and I'll quickly explain what it is. The electron is a particle
and it turns out the electron spins. It orbits rather like the earth orbits and it has an axis
of spin and you can change the axis of that spin and the way you change it is you take a magnetic
field like this and in the presence of a magnetic field the electron will spin, the electron will
stay in one place but spin and then the axis of spin will slowly rotate like this. It's what's
called procession and the speed at which the axis of that spin processes is dictated by this number
here. So it's not the most important thing in the big picture however historically this has
been extremely important in the history of physics because it turns out this is a number you
can measure very very accurately doing experiments and so this number has sort of acted as a testing
ground for us to see how well we understand the theories that underlie nature and in particular
quantum field theory. So let me tell you what you're looking at here. The first number is
the result of many many decades of painstaking experiments measuring very very precisely
this feature of the electron. It's called the magnetic moment.
And the second number is the result of many many decades of very tortuous calculations sitting down
with a pen and paper and trying to predict from first principles from quantum field theory
what the magnetic moment of the electron should be. And you can see it's it's simply spectacular
and that there's nothing like this anywhere else in science with an agreement between
the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurements. It's sort of I think it's 12 or 13
significant figures. It's really astonishing. Any other area of science you'll be jumping up and
down for joy if you get the first two numbers right. Economics not even that you know just
but but this is where we're at in particle physics on a good day when we really understand
what we're doing with it's substantially better than than than any other area of science. 12
significant figures. But this of course I've shown it because this is our best result. There are many
other results that are nowhere near as good and the difficulty comes when those quantum vacuum
fluctuations start getting wilder and stronger. So let me give you an example. It should be possible
for us to sit down and calculate from first principles the mass of the proton. Okay we
we have the equations you know everything should be there we just you know need to work hard and
figure out what the mass of the proton is just by doing calculations. We've been trying to do this
for about 40 years now. We can get it to within an accuracy of something like three percent okay
which which isn't bad you know we're three percent there but but we should be much much better you
know we should be sort of pushing these levels of of accuracy. And the reason is very simple you
know we've got the right equation we're pretty sure we you know we're solving the right equation
it's simply that we're not smart enough to solve it okay 40 years the world's most powerful computers
lots and lots of smart people but but just you know we haven't managed to to figure this out yet.
Okay there are other situations that I won't tell you about where we don't even get off the ground
there are some situations where for fairly subtle reasons we're unable to use computers to help us
and we simply have no idea what we're doing. So it's a slightly strange situation we have this
theories of physics that the best theories we've ever developed as you can see by this
but at the same time they're also the theories that we understand the least and it's to make progress
we sort of have this strange balancing act between you know increasing our theoretical
understanding and figuring out how to apply that to the experiments that that we're doing and again
it's a theme I'll come back to at the end of the end of this lecture. All right so so far I've
been talking in a little bit of generality about you know what we're made of and this this is the
punchline for the halfway point of the talk you're all made of quantum fields and I don't understand
at least I don't understand them as well as I I think I should. So what I want to do now is
is go into a little bit more specifics I want to tell you exactly what quantum fields you're all
made of in fact I'll tell you exactly what quantum fields exist in the universe and the good news
is there's not many of them so I'll simply tell you all of them. So we started with the periodic
table this is the new periodic table and it's much simpler you know it's much nicer there are the
three particles that we're all made of there's the electron and the two quarks the up quark and the
down quark and as I've stressed the particles aren't fundamental what's really fundamental is the field
that underlies them and then it turns out there's a fourth particle that I've not discussed so far
it's called the neutrino it's not important in what we're made of but it does play another important
role in elsewhere in the universe these neutrinos are everywhere you've never noticed them but since
I began this talk something like 10 to the 14 of them have streamed through the body of each and
every one of you as many coming from above from outer space as actually coming from below because
they stream all the way through the earth and then keep going they're not very sociable they don't
interact so this is what everything is made of these are the four particles that form the bedrock
of our universe except then something rather strange happened for a reason that we do not
understand at all nature has chosen to take these four particles and reproduce them twice over
so this is actually the list of all the fields that make up particles in our universe so what are
we looking at here this is the electron it turns out there are two other particles which behave in
every way exactly the same as the electron except they're heavier we call them the muon which has
a mass of something like 200 times the electron and the tau particle which is 3000 times heavier
than the electron okay why are they there we have no idea at all it's one of the mysteries of the
universe there's also two more neutrinos so there are three neutrinos in total and the two quarks
that we first knew about are now joined by four others that we call the strange quark and the
charmed quark and then by the time we got here we really ran out of any kind of inspiration for
naming and we call them the bottom quark and the top quark okay so I should stress we understand
things very very well going this way we understand why they come in a group of four we understand
why they have the properties that they do we don't understand it at all going this way we don't know
why there's three of these rather than two of them or seventeen of them or that that's that's a
mystery but this is everything this is everything in the universe everything you're made of is
is these three at the top there and it's only when you go to more exotic situations like
particle colliders that we need the others on the bottom but every single thing we've ever seen
can be made out of these 12 particles 12 fields these 12 fields interact with each other and they
interact through four different forces two of these are extremely familiar the force of gravity
and the force of electromagnetism but there's also two other forces which operate only on small
scales of a nucleus so there's something called the strong nuclear force which holds the quarks
together inside protons and neutrons and there's something called the weak nuclear force which
is responsible for radioactive decay and among other things for making the sunshine okay again
each of these forces is associated to a field so faraday taught us about the electromagnetic
field but there's a field associated to this which is called the glue on field and a field
associated to this which is called the w and z bows on field there's also a field associated to
gravity and this was really einstein's great insight into the world the field associated to gravity
turns out to be space and time itself so if you've never heard that before that was the world's
shortest introduction to general relativity and i'm not going to say anything else about it i'll
just let you figure that one out for yourself okay so so this is this is the universe we live in
there are 12 fields that give matter i'll call them matter fields and four other fields that are the
forces and the world we live in is these combination of the 16 fields all interacting
together in in interesting ways so this is what you should think of the universe as like it's
filled with these fields fluid like substances 12 matter four forces one of the matter fields
starts to oscillate and ripple say the electron field starts to to wave up and down because
there's electrons there that will kick off one of the other fields it'll kick off say the electromagnetic
field which in turn will also oscillate and ripple there'll be light which is emitted so that'll
oscillate ripple at some point it'll start interacting with the quark field which in turn
will oscillate and ripple and the picture we end up with is this harmonious dance between
all these fields interlocking each other swaying moving this way and that way that's the picture
that we have of the fundamental laws of physics we have a theory which underlies all this it is
to put it simply the pinnacle of science it's the greatest theory we've ever come up with we've
given it the most astonishingly rubbish name you've ever heard of we call it the standard model
okay when you hear the name the standard model it sounds tedious and monday it should really be
replaced for the greatest theory in the history of human civilization okay that that's that that's
what we're looking at okay so um this is everything except it's not quite uh i've
i've actually just missed out one field there's one extra thing we know about um which uh became
quite famous in in in recent years it was a field that was first suggested in the 1960s
by a Scottish physicist called Peter Higgs and it was by the 1970s it had become an integral part
of the way we thought about the universe but for the longest time we didn't have direct
experimental evidence that this existed where direct experimental evidence means we make this
Higgs field ripple so we see a particle that's associated to it and this changed this changed
famously uh four years ago uh at the LHC uh these are the two experiments at the LHC that
discovered it that they're sort of the size of cathedrals and just packed full of electronics
they're astonishing things this is called atlas this is called CMS um the the Higgs particle
doesn't last for long the Higgs particle lasts about 10 to the minus 22 seconds so it's not like
you know you see it and you get to take a picture of it and put it on instagram um you it's a little
more subtle so this is the data and this little bump here is uh is how we know that this Higgs
particle existed this is a picture of Peter Higgs being found um so um this was the final
building block you know it was important it was a really big deal and it was important for for two
reasons um the first is that this is what's responsible for what we call mass in the universe
so the properties of all the particles things like electric charge and mass
are really a statement about how their fields interact with other fields so the property that
we call electric charge of an electron is a statement about how the electron field interacts
with the electromagnetic field and the property of its mass is the statement about how it interacts
with the Higgs field so understanding this was really the uh was needed so that we understand
the meaning of mass in the universe so it it was a big deal the other reason that it was a big deal
is this was the final piece of our jigsaw we had this theory that we called the standard model we've
had it since the 1970s this was the final thing that we needed to discover to be sure that this
theory is is correct and the astonishing thing is this particle was predicted in the 1960s
50 years we've been waiting we finally created it in CERN it behaves in exactly the way that
we thought it would absolutely perfectly behaves as we predicted using these theories
okay um this is going to be the scary part of the talk um you know I've been telling you about
this theory and I've been I've been waving my hands pretending that I'm a field um let me tell you
what the theory really is let me just show you what we do uh this is uh the equation uh for the
standard model of physics I don't expect you to understand it uh not least because there are
parts of this equation that no one on the planet understands um but nonetheless I want to show it
to you for the following reason uh this equation correctly predicts the result of every single
experiment we've ever done in science everything is contained in in this equation this is really
the the pinnacle of the reductionist approach to science it's it's all in here so you know I'll
admit it's not the simplest equation in the world but it's not the most complicated either you can
put it on a t-shirt if you want to in fact if you go to CERN you can buy a t-shirt with with
this equation on it um let me just give you a sense of what we're looking at um the first term here
was written down by Albert Einstein and describes gravity what that means is that if you could solve
this tiny little part of the equation just this excuse me uh just this r you can for example predict
how fast an apple falls from a tree or the fact that the orbits of the planet around the sun
form ellipses or you can predict what happens when two enormous black holes collide into each
other and form a new black hole sending out gravitational waves across the universe or in
fact you can predict how the entire universe itself expands all of this comes from solving
this little part of the equation the the next term in the equation was written down by James
Clarke Maxwell and it tells you everything about electromagnetism so all the experiment
experiments that Faraday spent a lifetime doing in this this building in fact all the
experiments over many centuries from Coulomb to Faraday to Hertz to modern developments of lasers
everything in this tiny little part of of the equation so there's some power in in these equations
this is the equation that governs the strong nuclear force the weak nuclear force uh this is
an equation that was first written down by a british physicist called Paul Dirac uh it um it
describes the matter describes those 12 particles that that make up the matter astonishingly each
of them obeys exactly the same equation uh these are the equations of Peter Higgs and this is an
equation that tells you how the matter interacts with with the Higgs particle so everything is
is in here it's really an astonishing achievement this is our current limit of knowledge we've never
done an experiment that cannot be explained by this equation and we've never found a way in which
this equation stops working so this is the best thing that that we currently have okay it's the
best thing that we currently have however we want to do better because we know for sure that there's
stuff out there that is not explained by this and the reason we know is that although this explains
every single experiment we've ever done here on earth if we look out into the sky there's extra
stuff which is still a mystery so uh if we look out into space there are for example invisible
particles out there in fact there's many more invisible particles than there are visible particles
we call them dark matter we can't see them obviously because they're invisible uh but we
can see their effects we can see their effects on the way galaxies rotate or the way they bend
light around galaxies they're out there we don't know what they are um there's even more mysterious
things there's something called dark energy which is spread throughout all of space it's also some
kind of field although not one we understand that's causing everything in the universe to repel everything
else uh other things we know that uh early in the uh first few seconds earlier than that the first
few fractions of a second after the big bang the universe underwent a very rapid phase of expansion
that we call inflation we know it happened but it's not explained by that equation that i
i just showed you so these are the kind of things that we're going to have to understand
if we're going to move forward uh and decide what the next laws of physics are that go beyond
the standard model um i could tell you i could spend hours talking about either of the any of
these i'm going to focus just on the last one i'm going to tell you a little bit about um about
inflation um so uh the universe is 13.8 billion years old and uh we understand fairly well well
we don't understand at all how it started we don't understand what kicked it all off at time t equals
zero but we understand fairly well what happened after it started and we know in particular that
for the first um uh the first three hundred and eighty thousand years of the universe it was filled
with a fireball and we know this for sure because we've seen the fireball in fact we've seen it and
we've taken a photograph of it uh this um is called the cosmic microwave background radiation
but a much better name for it is the fireball that filled the universe uh when it was much younger
okay the fireball uh cooled down uh its light has been streaming through the universe for 13.8
billion years uh but we can see it we can take this photograph of it and um uh we can sort of
understand very well what was happening in these these first few moments of of the universe and
you can see it it looks literally like a fireball there there's red bits that are hotter there's
blue bits that are colder and by studying this flickering that you can see in this picture
we get a lot of information about what was going on back 13.8 billion years ago when the universe
was a baby one of the main questions we want to ask is what caused the flickering in the fireball
and um we have an answer to this we we have an answer which which i think is one of the most
astonishing things in in all of science um it turns out that although the universe last sorry
although the fireball lasted for three hundred and eighty thousand years uh whatever caused this
flickering could not have taken place during the vast majority of that time whatever caused the
flickering in this fireball actually took place in the first few very fractions of a second after
the big bang and what it was was the following so when the universe was very very young there was this
uh uh when the universe was very very young soon after the big bang there were no particles
but there were quantum fields because the quantum fields were everywhere and there were these quantum
vacuum fluctuations and what happened was the universe expanded very very quickly and it caught
these quantum fluctuations in the act so the quantum fluctuations were stretched across the
entire sky where they became frozen and it's these vacuum fluctuations here which are the ripples
that you see in the fireball so it's an astonishing story that the quantum vacuum fluctuations were
taking place 10 to the minus 30 seconds after the big bang they were absolutely microscopic
and now we see them stretched across the entire universe stretched 20 billion light years across
the sky that's what you're seeing here and yet you do the calculations for this and it batches
perfectly what you see here so this is another of the great triumphs of of quantum field theory
but it leaves lots of questions the most important one is which field are we seeing here
which field is this that's imprinted on on the the background radiation and the answer is we don't
know the only one of the standard model fields it has a hope of being is the Higgs but most of
us think it's not the Higgs but probably something new but what we'd like to do moving forward into
the future is get a much better picture of this fireball in particular get the polarization of
the light and by getting a picture of this we can understand much better the properties of this field
that was fluctuating in in the early universe okay this looking forward is one of the best
hopes that we have for going beyond the standard model and understanding new physics in the last
ten minutes though i'd like to bring you back down to earth sort of we've got lots of experiments
here on earth where we're also trying to do better where we're also trying to go beyond the standard
model of physics beyond that equation to understand what's what's new and there's many of them but the
most prominent is the one i've already mentioned it's it's the LHC so what happened was the LHC
discovered the Higgs boson in 2012 and soon afterwards it closed down for two years it had an upgrade
and last year in 2015 the LHC turned on again with twice the energy that it had when it discovered
the Higgs and the goal was two-fold the goal was firstly to understand the Higgs better
which is done fantastically and secondly to discover new physics that lies beyond the Higgs new
physics beyond the standard model so before i tell you what what it's seen uh let me tell you some
of the ideas we had some of our expectations and hopes for what would happen moving forward
so that this is our favorite equation again um the the idea has always been the following
you know if you're a Victorian scientist and you go back and you look at the periodic table of
elements then it's true that there's patterns in there that give a hint of the structure that lies
underneath okay there's numbers that that repeat themselves where if you're very smart you might
start to realize that you know yes there is something deeper than than than just these elements so our
hope as theorists is to look at this equation and see if maybe we can just find patterns in this
equation that suggests there might be something deeper that that lies underneath and they're there
so let me give you an example this is the equation uh that describes the force of electricity and
magnetism and it's almost the same as the equations which describe the forces for the strong force
and the weak nuclear force okay in fact you can see i've just changed letters okay i it's a little
more complicated than that but it's not it's not much more complicated than that the three forces
really look similar so you might wonder well maybe there's not three forces in the universe maybe
those three forces are actually just one force and when we think there's three forces it's because
we're looking at that one force just from slightly different perspectives maybe here's something else
which is amazing these are the equations uh for the 12 matter fields in the universe the
neutrinos the electrons and and the quarks each of them obeys exactly the same equation each of
them obeys the dirac equation so again you might wonder that well maybe there aren't 12 different
fields maybe they're all uh uh the same field and the same particle and the fact they look
differences again maybe just because we're looking at them from slightly different perspectives
maybe so uh these ideas that i've been suggesting go by the name of unification
the idea that the three forces are actually combined into one is what's called grand unification
and it's very easy it's very easy to write down a mathematical theory in which all of these are
just one force which which appears to be three from our our perspective okay there are other
possibilities here you might say well this is the matter and these are the forces and the equations
are different but they're not that different because ultimately they're both just fields
so you might wonder if maybe there's some way in which the matter and the forces are related
to each other well uh we have a theory for that as well it's a theory that's called supersymmetry
and uh it's a beautiful theory it's very deep conceptually um and it sort of you know smells
like it might be right finally you might be really really bold you might say uh well can I just
combine the lot can i just get rid of all of these terms and just write down one single term from
which everything else emerges gravity the forces the particles the higgs everything well i've got
something for you if you want that as well it's called string theory so we have a possibility
for a theory which contains all of this in one simple concept and the question going forward of
course is are these right you know it's very easy for us uh theorists to have have these ideas
and i should say these ideas of what's driven theoretical physics for 30 years
but we want to know are they right and uh we've got a way of telling them right we do experiments
so i i should say if you want to know if string theory is right uh we don't have any way to test
it at the moment but if you want to know if some of these other ideas are right then that's what the
lhc should be doing the reason that we built the lhc was firstly to find the higgs okay it worked
and secondly to test these kind of ideas that we've been having to see what lies beyond so the lhc
has been running it's been running for two years it's been running like an absolute dream it's just
it's a perfect machine uh two years uh this is what it's seen absolutely nothing okay all of these
fantastic beautiful ideas that we've had none of them are showing up at all and the question
going forward is you know what are we going to do about it uh you know how are we going to make
progress in understanding the next layer of physics when the lhc isn't seeing anything and our ideas
just just don't appear to be uh the way that nature works okay i should tell you off and i don't
have a good answer to this um it's uh i said my impression is that most of my community is a little
bit shell shocked by by what happened um there's certainly no consensus in the community to
move forward but i think there's three responses that that sort of various people have had that i'd
like to share with you i think all three of these responses are reasonable up to a point um the first
response to the lhc not seeing anything is is the following it's um well you know you you you young
kids you're you're so pessimistic it's all doom and gloom with you you just you need a little bit
more patience you know it didn't see anything last year and it didn't see anything this year but but
next year it's going to see something and if not next year it's the year after that that it's going
to see something okay it's it's usually my my very illustrious senior colleagues that that have this
this response and you know what they could easily be right it could easily be that next year the lhc
discovers something astonishing and it sets us on the path to understanding the next layer of
layer of reality um but it's also true that these same people were predicting that it would have
seen something by now and it's also true that um this can't keep going for much longer if the lhc
doesn't see something within say a two-year timescale it seems very very unlikely that it's going to
see something moving forward it's possible it just seems unlikely so uh you know we'll know i i hope
with all my heart that the lhc discovers something next year or the year after um but i think we have
to prepare for for the worst that that maybe it won't okay response number two uh response number
two which which is sort of also by by similar people um uh well all our theories are so beautiful
they absolutely have to be correct and what we really need is a bigger machine okay uh ten times
bigger we'll we'll we'll do it okay again they they they might be right i don't have a good argument
against it uh the obvious rebuttal however is that a new machine costs ten billion dollars
and there's not too many governments in the world that have ten billion dollars
to spare for us to uh us us to explore these ideas there's one uh the one is china and so if this
machine is going to be built at all it's going to be built by the chinese government i think the
chinese government would would see it as extremely attractive if the whole community of uh particle
physicists and engineers that are currently based in cern and geneva uh move to a town that's slightly
north of beijing i think i think they'd uh view that as a political and economic gain and there's
you know a real chance that they may decide to build this machine if they do it's about 20 years
for it to be built so uh we're waiting slightly longer uh there's a third response um and i should
say the third response is is kind of the camp i'm in um i should mention upfront it's speculative
and it's probably not endorsed by most of most of my peers so this is really just my personal
opinion at at this point um this is my take on on this um this is you know uh this is the equation
that uh uh we know is right this is sort of the bedrock of our our understanding but although we
know it's right there's an awful lot in this equation that we haven't understood there's an
awful lot to me that's still mysterious in this equation so although this equation looked like
there were suggestions of unification maybe they're just red herrings and maybe if we just
work harder and trying to understand this equation more we'll find that uh there are other patterns
that emerge so my response is i think that maybe we should just go back to the drawing board and
start to challenge some of the assumptions and paradigms that that we've been holding for
the past 30 years so i i should admit i i feel quite energized actually by the lack of results
for the LHC you know i i sort of it feels good to me that everyone was was wrong you know it's
when we're wrong that we start to make make progress uh so i i sort of feel quite happy by this about
this um and think that um you know there's a very real chance that we we could just you know start
thinking about different ideas i should say that you know there are hints in here there are hints to
me about you know mathematical patterns that we haven't explored that there's hints in this about
connections to other areas of science things like condensed metaphysics which is the science of how
materials work or quantum information science which is uh the attempt to build a quantum computer
all of these fantastic subjects have have new ideas which sort of feed in to the kind of questions
that that we're asking here so i'm quite optimistic that moving forward uh we can make progress maybe
not the progress that we thought we'd make a few years ago but just uh just something new um
so that's the punchline of my talk the punchline is that uh this is the single greatest equation
that we've ever written down uh but i hope that someday uh we can give you something better thank
you for your attention there's nothing discreet about the Schrodinger equation the Schrodinger
equation is is something you know to do with a smoother field like like wave function uh the
discreteness is something which emerges when you solve the Schrodinger equation so it's not built
into the heart of nature
