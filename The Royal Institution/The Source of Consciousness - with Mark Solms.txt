Thank you very much Lisa and thank you all for being here. I was going to say this evening
but I realise it's not necessarily evening for all of you. So as you just heard I'm
publishing a book. In fact it's released today in the United Kingdom in a couple of weeks in
the United States with the same title as my talk, The Hidden Spring, A Journey to the Source of
Consciousness. Hopefully when I've finished in an hour's time what I'm going to present to you
you will understand why the book has this title. The book is of course about consciousness
and I'm quoting here what the physicist Paul Davies recently wrote about consciousness
but I could have found a hundred scientists saying basically the same thing.
Davies says, among life's many baffling properties the phenomenon of consciousness
sleeps out as especially striking. Its origin is arguably the hardest problem facing science today
and the only one that remains almost impenetrable even after two and a half millennia of deliberation.
Consciousness is the number one problem of science of existence even. So our topic tonight
is not a small one it is widely regarded as the number one problem of science today.
So my book is about this problem but this is a lecture and of course I can't begin to cover all
the complexities that require a book length treatment. So what I'm going to say tonight is a
sort of extracting things down to their essence. I'm going to simplify and I'm going to simplify
by focusing on just one strand although it is a sort of a red thread running through the book.
One strand of the argument and I'll state that argument upfront. It is that we have made so little
progress in terms of solving the problem that Paul Davies identifies here because we've been
looking in the wrong place. We've been looking for the explanation of how and why consciousness
arises in the cerebral cortex, the long-standing assumed seat of consciousness and I'm going to
argue that we should be looking elsewhere. We should be looking in a far more primitive structure,
the brainstem in particular the reticular activating system at the core of the brainstem
and not at these higher cognitive functions that are performed by the cortex and in particular
by the human cortex but rather at far more basic functions of the kind that are performed in the
brainstem, specifically raw feelings. I'm going to argue that raw feelings are the fundamental
form of consciousness in all sorts of ways and that if we've shifted our attention from higher
cognition to lower as it were feelings the hard problem becomes less hard. In order to escape
the risk of overly abstract ideas I thought I would tell my story via a series of cases,
some clinical case histories. I've lined up six for you and I hope I get through all six of them
because as I say I have only an hour so let's hope I get through them all but at least it'll
give you some flavor of the lived experience of patients with disorders of consciousness
who have been so helpful to me over the years in terms of my efforts to unravel this problem.
But let's start in the obvious place. I'm going to read you now the formulation of the hard problem
by David Chalmers in a paper in 1995 he coined that term and this is what he wrote.
It is undeniable that some organisms are subject of experience but the question of how it is that
these systems or subjects of experience is perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive
systems engage in visual and auditory information processing we have visual or auditory experience,
the quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C. How can we explain there is something it's
like to an image or experience an emotion? It's widely agreed that experience arises from a
physical basis but we have no good explanation of how and why it so arises. Now this is the way
that Chalmers formulated the hard problem but of course this is not a new problem as David said
it's something we've been pondering for millennia but in particular I've emphasized this phrase
something it is like in order to make a link back to another philosopher Tom Nagel who wrote in 1974
an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be
that organism something it's like for the organism and later in the paper that same paper he wrote
if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of
experience we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about
how this could be done. So my aim this evening in this brief talk is to give you a clue about
how this could be done. I told you I'm going to well let me first of all sorry I see what I have
on the screen here is I've wanted to state as succinctly as problem as possible what this problem
is that that I'm addressing and you can think as as I go along whether or not I am answering this
question this is the hard problem why and how is there something it's like to be an organism
something it's like for the organism now what I started to say is I told you I'm going to address
this via a series of cases in order to to not get too lost in abstractions here's our first case
this is the this is the case he is in fact my brother this photograph was taken
when he was two and a half or two short of three years old and I as you can see was a baby
we were born in a small village and for all sorts of reasons we were rather isolated
so we were best of friends and we got on famously one day four and a bit years after this photograph
was taken my parents were yachting and my brother climbed up onto the onto the clubhouse roof
while I was wading in the in the waters of the of the lake below and he tripped and he fell
three stories and landed on his head on the paving stones below fractured his skull
and sustained an intracerapal bleed and he was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Cape Town
called Khrutaskir to the neurosurgery department where amazingly but not entirely coincidentally
where I work today that sort of hemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency but fortunately in
my brother's case the bleeding stopped and the hemorrhage the hematoma reabsorbed and
he survived and a few weeks later he was flown back home he looked exactly the same as he had
before apart from the fact that he had to wear a helmet to protect his fractured skull but despite
the appearance being the same he was not the same as a person he was utterly different
and you can imagine to me as a four and a half year old how how uncanny this this this is Lee
he looks like Lee but he isn't Lee it was of course a terrible tragedy for him and for my family
Lee for me personally it was extremely disturbing especially for the in the way that I've just
described I couldn't get my head around the the fact that he was so changed and so in this way
I was confronted I think a little earlier than most of us are with this fact that we ourselves
are subjective beings our personalities our minds are somehow also just a bodily organ
and if that organ is damaged then we're we're we're changed and by implication what's happened to
my brother could have happened to me could have happened to any one of us if our brains were
damaged in the way that his was the hematoma reabsorbed but it leaves damage and also there's
these things called external shearing from the kind of injury that he had if this were to happen
to any one of us we would not be ourselves we would be somebody else and by further implication
you know when our brains die we literally disappear so this is the gravity of the problem that we
that we're talking about it wasn't obviously at the age of four I didn't decide okay
in order to solve this problem I better become a neuroscientist but I have no doubt that those
early childhood experiences are what drove me to study neuroscience and in particular to be
interested in that branch of neuroscience that we call neuro psychology in other words how
mental functions relate to brain functions when I went to university which was in the
to study this which was in the early 1980s I was however quickly
disabused of the idea that studying neuro psychology would would provide the answers I
was looking for as to how hard does it happen this thing that Davis was talking about the
charmers was talking about how does it happen that out of how can it possibly be that a physical
organ is me how am I produced by these by these physiological processes in in in these anatomical
structures but the this is not what I was taught what I was taught rather was how the cortex and
I emphasize here cortex because in the 1980s neuro psychology basically was the study of higher
cortical functions and neurologists study the brain stem functions those have to do with the body
neuro psychologists study cortical functions they have to do with the mind and I was taught how
visual information is processed in this part of the cortex and some matter sensory processes here
and auditory processes there but when I asked my lecturers where does all of this information you
know where am I in in the processing of all this information where's the subject that receives
the visual and auditory and some matter sensory and what not information and I was kindly advised by
my professors not to ask questions like that those are not proper scientific questions and
they're bad for your career but I wasn't studying this because I was interested in
building a career I really needed to understand how this works and so when I was taught as I'm
showing in the slide on the screen at the moment how the how visual information processing occurs
in the visual cortex you know and and and how incredibly elaborate all these different component
processes are how we go from you know the the the initial image in v1 to these various processing
streams whereby in one of them you know you recognize color and movement and and faces
and another if you're a human being you're able to recognize letters and words and read you know
all of these things and how ultimately all of these this visual information is encoded into
the hippocampus you know into into long-term memory all of these functional mechanisms were
incredibly interesting but the question the problem for me was you know visual information
processing of this kind can be done by your mobile phone and in fact what I have on the screen for you
now is is not that different from a circuit diagram you know which which describes the sorts of
information processing that your mobile phone does performs your mobile phone can recognize faces
as you might have noticed when you when you're taking a photograph and the way that it sifts through
the stored images it classifies them these are faces these are places etc exactly the same
sort of thing as as I was being taught about how our brains work but the sentient subject
who receives this information the the what it is like to see was not a respectable question it wasn't
addressed at all around that time I read this book by Oliver Sacks called a leg to stand on
it was before he became so famous with his book the man who mistook his wife for a hat in this book
a leg to stand on in 1984 he wrote neuropsychology like classical neurology aims to be entirely
objective and its great power its advances come from just this but a living creature and especially
a human being is first and last active a subject not an object it's precisely the subject the living
eye which is being excluded neuropsychology is admirable but it excludes the psyche it excludes
the experiencing active living eye so that sentence neuropsychology is admirable but it excludes the
psyche captured exactly my dismay and frustration with my field such was how things stood in the
1980s and I think that this has a great deal to do with why David Chalmers formulated the hard
problem in the way that he did and I'm now going to read you a further passage from his book in
which he clarifies that this hard problem pivots on the question of function on the function of
visual experience for example let me read it to you the easy problems are easy precisely because
they concern the explanation of cognitive abilities and functions to explain a cognitive function
we need only specify a mechanism that can perform the function the methods of cognitive science are
well suited for this sort of explanation and so are well suited to the easy problems of consciousness
by contrast the hard problem is hard precisely because it is not a problem about the performance
of functions the problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is
explained what makes the hard problem hard and almost unique is that it goes beyond problems
about the performance of functions to see this note that even when we've explained the performance
of all the cognitive and behavioral functions in the vicinity of experience they may still remain
a further unanswered question why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience
a simple explanation of the functions leaves this question open why doesn't all this information
processing go on in the dark free of any inner feel just to make clear the gravity of the problem
that traumas is identifying here i want to tell you briefly about what another philosopher said
on this point this was frank jackson in his in his celebrated knowledge argument
the the the story revolves around a visual neuroscientist named mary and i'm going to tell
the story in a simplified form in the interests of time mary knows everything that there is to know
about the functional mechanisms of vision but she's blind so although she knows exactly how
light waves are transduced by the photosensitive rods and cones of the retina and and transmitted
to the lateral geniculate body and from there to the visual cortex and how all those processing
streams that i showed you in the earlier slide further specialized modules process that information
exactly what those neurons do exactly what the functional mechanisms of the different processing
streams are despite all of that she she knows nothing about what it is like to see and then
thank god one day the gift of sight is bestowed upon her and for the first time in her life she
actually experiences that deep blue that charmers spoke of the the actual quality of of visual
experience redness blueness movement form contour and so on and jackson's point is at that moment
she learned something utterly new about vision something which was not predicted not explained
at all by her functional her understanding of the physical mechanisms whereby visual
information is processed and the point is that because those mechanisms can be absolutely
understood without there being any not only any need to understand what visual experience is like
but also no bridge there's no there's no doesn't predict that they will have to be visual experience
and so this new thing this new qualitative experiential thing that mary becomes acquainted with
is not at all contained within the knowledge that's why it's called the knowledge argument
that she had of the functional mechanisms of vision and the alarming conclusion that people
like jackson and nagle and charmers come to in consequence is that conscious experience the
actual something it is likeness of seeing exists in some sort of parallel universe some other
dimension some someplace other than the physical universe in which causal mechanisms explain
how how one thing produces another so this is what charmers is talking about when he says
why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience why doesn't all this
information processing go on in the dark free of any inner field the information processing accounts
the mechanistic functionalist accounts of visual processing in the cortex and i'm using vision as
my model example because that's what we do in cognitive neuroscience when it comes to trying
to understand the mechanisms of consciousness that's where we've been looking on the assumption
that if we can if we can isolate the mechanism of visual consciousness then we can generalize from
there to other forms of consciousness and explain consciousness as a whole charmers this point is
that mary who knew everything there was to know about the functional mechanisms of visual
information processing knew nothing at all about what it is like to see this seems to be an entirely
different order of things so how how are we to make sense of this by the 1990s john kilstrom was
able to write an article with this title it's a review of the literature on unconscious visual
and other perceptual and other cognitive cortical mechanisms the title says it all
perception without awareness of what is perceived learning without awareness of what is learned
the literature the research literature reviewed in this paper shows in a nutshell that you can
perceive visually and in other ways you can process this sort of information without knowing
that you're doing so you don't seem to have to know that you're doing so the cortex and the brain
as a whole can process visual and other perceptual stimuli and and act upon those stimuli without any
awareness that they've done so the same applies to learning you can learn things and remember
things and they will influence what you do in the future without having any knowledge
that you've learned those things and that you're remembering things all of this can go on automatically
to paraphrase charmers in the dark just to give you some sense of the kinds of evidence
that kilstrom drew upon in writing this review article and coming to the conclusions which
are sort of alluded to in in the title in one study research participants are shown
in a in the via a paradigm called an instrument called the tachistoscope which flashes visual
information so briefly for so few milliseconds that you don't even know you've seen anything at all
let alone what you've seen in this experiment the participants were shown two faces face a
under which was written the word rapist and face b under which was written the word philanthropist
now remember they didn't know they'd seen anything at all let alone that they'd seen a face and read
a word after the tachistoscopic phase of the experiment they're then shown superluminally
those same two photographs and asked which of the two faces they prefer which of the two people
they prefer and the the with a very high degree of statistical significance the the research
participants choose face b when asked why are you choosing this face over the other they say i don't
know because of course they don't know consciously why they're doing so they say it's just no intuition
or my gut feeling i i just prefer this chap we know why they did it they did it because of the
words that were associated with those faces and that's precisely the point that this kind of
cognitive process this higher visual cortical because let me be clear that recognizing faces is a
uniquely cortical function and indeed reading with comprehension is a uniquely human
cortical function so these sorts of functions can go on perfectly well without awareness
and this is the essence in a manner of speaking of what charmers is saying he's saying you know these
these things can go on in the dark and that begs the question that charmers asks why doesn't
to do so why do we have to be aware of these things at all and the provisional conclusion that i
now want to state is that it's because they don't visual cortical processes and all
cortical processes and cognitive processes are not intrinsically conscious as kilstrom's review
shows therefore it's no surprise that if we have focused our research efforts on trying to understand
the brain basis of consciousness the physical mechanisms of consciousness by looking in at
functions which are not inherently intrinsically conscious which can work just as well without
consciousness then we're looking in the wrong place if you remember my introductory remarks
this is the red thread that's going to run through what i what i'm going to say to you tonight
uh so let's move on to my next case um i told you that when i was a student
and i was taught about how these different streams of information coming from our sensory organs
and projected onto our cortex produce visual consciousness auditory consciousness etc and
i asked my professors but where am i you know where is the subject who receives all this information
by the 1990s 10 years after i asked that silly question which was considered silly it's a naive
question but many of the most naive questions are the most important questions by the 1990s
neuro psychology was asking those questions itself and the answers that it came to was that you know
visual and auditory and somatosensory information the sort of raw phenomenal consciousness
is not the main thing about subjectivity it's where it all comes together that question that i'd
asked where does it all come together and one of the main answers was it all comes together here
in the prefrontal lobes so for example bernard bars and stanislav kahan were saying that there's a
global workspace a sort of integrating of all of these different information streams here and this
is where the subject of the mind is that the remember consciousness the global workspace
in the sense of not just information processing streams coming from our sensory end organs but
rather the subject of the mind that receives them so i'm going to remember i'm just giving you an
impressionistic account in this brief lecture i'm going to ask you as scientists or people who
understand science if there's a theoretical claim that this is this part of the brain is where
consciousness is generated in the sense of a subjective sentient being of the mind then if
this part of the brain is damaged then that function should be lost so somebody who has no
prefrontal cortex should have no subjectivity in the sense that we are talking about here no
no person who receives all this information and knows this is my vision i am a sentient being the
sort of agent or i the active me that oliva sacks was talking about damage to this part of the brain
and complete damage to this part of the brain should should completely remove the thing that
we are looking for so i will now briefly describe to you a patient of mine who i'm calling patient
w who due to a complex pathology basically a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the anterior
communicating artery which needed to be operated on and the operation didn't go that well and then
there was sepsis and then it wasn't recognized early enough etc etc basically after a series of
operations he ended up like this with absolutely no prefrontal nerves so there's the prefrontal
nerves he doesn't have any here you see it again but fortunately he has a little sliver of cortex
here language cortex which enables him to describe his experience so i explained to patient w
that according to my colleagues he should lack a self he should lack this overarching sense of
sentient being receiving this perceptual information uh and knowing it's me who's seeing these things
that me should be missing i asked him is missing he said no not at all so i said well then bend
with me i'm gonna ask you a series of questions whereby i can illustrate demonstrate to my colleagues
that they're wrong i said to him are you consciously aware of your thoughts he said yes
of course i am i said in order to confirm that i'm going to ask you to solve a problem that
will require you to consciously picture a situation in your mind he says okay i say imagine that you
have two dogs and one chicken he says okay i said do you see them in your mind's eye he says yes
so i say now tell me how many legs do you see in total you get the point that if he's there
looking at this visual information that he's conjured up in his mind's eye he should be able
to count two dogs four plus four one chicken two turtles ten and that would show that there's somebody
there looking at the visual information so i you can imagine my disappointment when i say to him now
tell me how many legs do you see in total and he said eight and i said eight and then he said yes
the dogs at the chicken now that's not the best joke in the world but it shows that there's somebody
at home there's mr w was there thinking looking at this information and and and even been able to
take this additional humorous step of imagining that the dogs had at the chicken so the idea
that as the sentient being of the mind resides in the prefrontal cortex i don't believe it and of
course it's not based only on this case i'm using that to illustrate a point the other major theory
in cognitive neuroscience as to where the subject of the mind exists in the cortex is associated
with the name of bud craig and he identifies the insular as the critical part of the cortex
the insular is not like the prefrontal cortex where all the different information processing
streams converge from your various senses leading to your capacity to make decisions about what are
you going to do about it but rather it's where the visceral internal information from the from the
the vegetative body is transmitted to the cortex and integrated with this extraceptive information
so very very mainstream theory that this is where the self resides in the cortex so let's see what
happens if this part of the cortex is damaged as it was in this patient patient be a patient of
demasias like i did with my patient w demasia interviews his patient and asks him if he has a
self because the prediction arising from craig's theory is that he should lack such a thing demasias
this is a dialogue a conversation which hasn't been published but an article on this case has
been published do you have a sense of self says demasio patient says yes i do what if i told you
that you weren't here right now patient says i'd say you've gone blind and deaf demasias says do
you think that other people can control your thoughts he says no so why do you think that's
not possible he says you control your own mind hopefully demasias so what if i were to tell you
that your mind was the mind of somebody else patient says when was the transplant i mean the
brain transplant demasio what if i were to tell you that i know you better than you know yourself
patient says i would think you're wrong demasias says what if i were to tell you
that you're aware that i'm aware he says i would say you're right demasia you're aware that i'm
aware patient i'm aware that you're aware that i'm aware please note all these references to i
this is the very thing that's supposed to be missing in such patients so clearly the sentient
being of the mind is neither in the prefrontal cortex nor in the insular cortex but these patients
have some cortex left what about a patient who has absolutely no cortex what if the cortex as a
whole were to be removed surely this would remove the the the the the sentient subjectivity that
we are seeking to explain with our cortical theory of consciousness well here's a patient
three years old this one with absolutely no cortex this is a condition called hydra and
encephaly where the patient is born with a brain stem and a cerebellum which hangs off the back of
the brain stem but no forebrain at all is she conscious yes she is here she is she's awake
she goes to sleep at night she wakes up in the morning clearly she's conscious but much more
importantly look at this this is her reaction to her baby brother being placed on her lap
she responds emotionally to this experience so it's not only that she's awake it's not
some sort of blank wakefulness but a reactive mind with feelings and content it's not it cannot
possibly be representational cognition of the kind that the cortex performs because she doesn't
have any cortex she has only a brain stem and yet she's conscious and her consciousness has a
particular quality and it doesn't have anything to do with what's streaming in from the outside
consciously because remember the brain stem only processes sensory information unconsciously
this has got to do with her subjective response to that information even though she has no
cognitive clue what that information is is actually about it's a pure raw feeling and it's
not just her most of these kids are like that here's another patient tell me this patient isn't
conscious and that there's nobody home uh beyond merca wrote a review article about these patients
who he studied a great many of them and i'm not going to read you this long quotation but you
can see the words that i've that i've emphasized in yellow they have a wide range of emotions
and most importantly of all those emotional responses are situationally appropriate in other
words the patient shows laughter or irritability or fear in response to stimuli which which which
would evoke those same sort of feelings in you and me so this is a weighty piece of evidence that
the cortical theory is wrong the parts of the cortex that are supposed to be the the centers
for consciousness the integrative centers where a sentient self comes about even just this the
little smatterings of evidence that i've given you this evening show that this is that this is not
the case and even in patients in whom there is absolutely no cortex there's evidence that there
is consciousness consciousness not of the cognitive kind that we've been focusing on in our attempts
to solve the heart problem but rather consciousness of a far more rudimentary kind basic raw feelings
of the type that you saw these two little girls uh and and other children like them with the same
condition um able to express but of course you know how do we know um how do we know that that
what what it's like to be such a is there anything it's like to be such a child these are just
behaviors we can't be sure what what what they're experiencing but let's just let's just slow down
although i'm anxious about the time i keep on looking to my left which is where my clock is
and i see that i that i'm that i must speed up but but let's let's just make sure that i'm
conveying this really essential point you can remove the cortex the supposed seat of consciousness
in its entirety and i say remove of course in these children uh it's not removed experimentally in
experimental animals it is removed and we find exactly the same thing they are conscious they
they're awake and they display a full range of of emotional and situationally appropriate
appropriate emotional responses by contrast with that lesion evidence now we look at the brain stem
if there's damage in these structures these these tiny structures in the primitive brain stem called
the reticular activating system then the lights go out so the lights do not go out uh if there's
no cortex but if if if there's tiny lesions in the reticular activating system of the brain stem
as small as two cubic millimeters fissure and colleagues recently published a article in which
they studied numerous patients with brain stem strokes and showed that a two cubic millimeter
lesion in the parabrecl region is all that's required to totally obliterate consciousness
so what that shows is that cortical consciousness is dependent upon brain stem consciousness what
what's generated here in the reticular activating system is a prerequisite for cortical consciousness
and what is more remember that cortical consciousness is not always present in other words
the cortex is able to process information without consciousness so what makes it conscious is
activation by this reticular activating system now that's not controversial what i've just said to you
we're i'm making the argument we're looking in the wrong place you know this is not intrinsically
conscious this is the foundation of consciousness why don't we look there
and i've showed you in those hydranine cephalic girls that the people who only have a brain stem
have consciousness of a particular type and that is affective consciousness so is this not
that this intrinsic prerequisite for all of the other forms of consciousness there is this not
the place that we should be looking if we're trying to find out what the functional mechanism
of consciousness is so let me now go to my case five and the reason i'm doing this is because
i'm very much aware that in the case of these kids with no cortex you can't be sure that they
have consciousness because they can't speak the one function which certainly is cortical is language
and my patient w was able to describe his mental states because he had this sliver of
frontal cortex which which enables us to produce language those children didn't so we don't know
they can't tell us what they're experiencing just like our pet dogs and cats can't tell us what
they're experiencing we sense that they're conscious they respond emotionally we have
relationships with them but we can't know for sure so in science in such a situation what we
have to do is rely upon multiple lines of converging evidence we have to make predictions
on the hypothesis that the brainstem produces consciousness on the lesion studies suggest
that that's where the consciousness comes from and i'm saying it is a consciousness of a particular
type it's feeling it's affective consciousness then using another method for example deep brain
stimulation if we stimulate those structures those deep brainstem structures in patients who do
have intact cortex and can tell us what they experience we might predict that they would
experience intense effects and that's exactly what happens if you stimulate the substantia nigra
which is which is a midbrain part of the reticular activating system this is what happens in a patient
65 year old patient with Parkinson's disease that's why the stimulator was put into her brain
but the patient who'd never had any psychiatric pathology in her life within five seconds of the
stimulator being switched on it had actually gone deeper than the intended site the intended site was
not in the brainstem it went a few millimeters too deep into the reticular activating nucleus that
i mentioned and she within five seconds she falls into a depression i'm falling down in my head
i no longer wish to live to see anything hear anything feel anything when asked if she's in
pain she says no i'm fed up with life i've had enough i don't want to live anymore i'm disgusted
with life everything is useless always feeling worthless i'm scared in this world please notice
i don't want to live anymore a suicidal depression when asked why she's so sad she says i'm tired
i want to hide in a corner i'm crying over myself of course i'm hopeless why am i bothering you
after the stimulation within 90 seconds the depression disappears the patient very
bravely or generously agreed to do a double-blind trial after that where Blomsted stimulated either
in the higher structure that he had aimed for or in the reticulate structure that he had struck
accidentally without the patient knowing where he was stimulating and every time that he stimulated
in the in the reticulate nucleus she fell into this deep despair so this is a second line of
evidence you can actually stimulate intense emotions by stimulating those deep brainstem
structures here's a third line of evidence functional imaging petty imaging in this case
these are normal subjects with intense emotional states they are feeling intensely sad
angry happy or fearful the the pet imaging shows where in the brain the the the activity is
that's generating this mental state and in all of these cases it's in the brainstem
sadness anger happiness fear look at what's going on in the cortex next to nothing
so it's absolutely clear by this method too that the effects are generated in the brainstem
one last line of evidence is psychopharmacology psychiatrists tinker with the neuromodulatory
chemicals that are sourced in these very same brainstem nuclei so antidepressants increase
serotonin which is sourced in the rave nuclei of the reticular activating system anti-psychotics
blocked dopamine which is sourced in the ventral tegmental area of the reticular activating system
some anti-anxiety drugs block noradrenaline which is sourced in the locus ceruleus complex
of the reticular activating system if all that this system did was woke you up or
sort of produced a sort of background level of consciousness which is the standard view of what
this part of the brain is doing this is why when you lesionate you go into a coma
then anesthetists might be interested in these brain structures and these and these brain chemicals
but no psychiatrists are psychiatrists doctors for feelings treating emotional disorders
the clearly these these these these neuromodulator modulator sourced in the reticular activating
system have have something fundamental to do with feeling so let me just sum up i'm going to tell
you about another one of these neuromodulators in a few minutes if i if i get that far but let me
just sum up what i'm saying i'm saying that it's that the evidence is very strong that the source
of consciousness remember the subtitle of my book is this hidden spring deep in in the reticular
brainstem or structures which are prerequisite for consciousness to occur think of the the the
forebrain or the cortex as a sort of a television set and think of this as the power supply and the
standard view is well of course you know consciousness happens in the cortex like
television program transmission happens in the television set it has to have a power supply
it has to be plugged in at the wall but that doesn't mean that the source of television is the power
supply but as you've just seen if you tinker with this power supply you change the program you change
the actual television content it's not just a power supply it is literally the the the font of
consciousness and because it's prerequisite for these cortical forms of consciousness you the
the cortex isn't conscious unless it's aroused by the brainstem and because i've as i've showed you
the brainstem is generating not some power supply but rather consciousness with a particular content
and quality a particular feel a particular something that it is likeness that means the
foundational elemental basic form of consciousness is feeling and feeling is prerequisite for all
other forms of consciousness sigman freud the discoverer of the unconscious even freud who
was the person it taught us that the bulk of our cognition is unconscious what we rediscovered
100 years later in cognitive science that the bulk of our cognition is unconscious even he said
it's surely of the essence of an emotion that we should be aware of it that it should become known
to consciousness thus the possibility of the attribute of unconsciousness would be completely
excluded as far as emotions feelings and effects are concerned now i've emphasized the word
feelings because the words affect an emotion mean different things to different people
some people claim you can have unconscious emotions they don't agree with freud so i want to be clear
that i'm talking about this thing feeling you cannot have a feeling that you do not feel and
this is not just a linguistic point you know as i've just showed you the brainstem mechanisms
that generate raw feeling they generate consciousness itself but i say again this
this thing that i'm calling feeling cannot be other than felt if you don't feel it it isn't a
feeling and what i'm saying therefore is that unlike cortex the processes of which the information
processing of which is not intrinsically conscious shouldn't we be looking to the brainstem
the processes of which are intrinsically conscious in fact are the source of all
consciousness if you want to understand the function of consciousness then surely we need
to understand the function of feeling david charmers one more time says this is not to say
that experience has no function perhaps it'll turn out to play an important cognitive role etc
and he ends up saying there's no cognitive function such that we can say in advance that
explanation of that function will automatically explain experience this is you can see a
reiteration of what i said to you earlier but please note it's the word cognitive if you
change the word cognitive to affect it does it does his i mean would he even even have said this
there is no affective function such that we can say in advance that explanation of that function
will automatically explain experience i'm saying in advance that an explanation of the
function of feeling will automatically explain why it feels like something because that is the
function of feeling i hope you can see why this is an important red thread in the argument of my
book if we're wanting to understand consciousness we should be focusing on its most basic form
the form which is intrinsically conscious that is to say feeling because feeling has to be felt
unlike vision unlike hearing unlike memory unlike all forms of cognition for the most part they're
unconscious but feelings are always conscious and they are prerequisite for the higher forms of
consciousness so if we understand the function of feeling then we understand the function of
consciousness that's where we should be looking i say again there is every possibility that if
if you can explain the function of feeling then you'll know why you feel it so what is the function
of feeling well it's an extended form of homeostasis homeostasis as many of you might know is the
basic mechanism that keeps us alive living organisms unlike unlike inorganic matter
don't they don't dissipate they don't just you know if if the ambient temperature is is 10 degrees
then we just sort of become 10 degrees ourselves if we did we would die so we can't dissipate we
can't equalize with our environments we can't allow ourselves to obey the second law of thermodynamics
which states that in any natural process entropy will always increase homeostasis resists entropy
we say no i i can't equalize i have to maintain a particular temperature range i have to stay
between 36 and a half and 37 and a half degrees Celsius and if i deviate from that it's a problem
it's a demand for work and i have to perform work to get myself back into the temperature range
that is viable for for life and i speak here of temperature range this applies across a wide
range of physiological parameters so you have you know blood glucose levels blood oxygen levels
hydration levels sodium levels etc that you have to remain within otherwise you'd die
and you note the word prediction here there are algorithms built into our brains which say you
know if you're getting too hot that's a problem so you ought to do something and what must you do
the algorithm says well sweat that'll cool you down a pant that'll cool you down that's the
work that you have to do to get yourself back into your viable range so that's how homeostasis
works and i said feeling is an extended form of homeostasis and that extended form is that
when you deviate from your expected states from your viable states it feels bad the value system
that underpins all life is that it is bad to die and good to survive so if you're moving in
the direction of death of a physiological state which is which is incompatible with life it feels
bad that is the function of unpleasant it's it that is the meaning of unpleasant feelings it means
this is bad for me and conversely performing the work that gets you back into your viable state
feels pleasurable and this is how you know that you're heading in the right direction why is this
important i told you that you have to have predictions here algorithms built into the system
that tell the system what to do you know demand for work i know what i've got to do got a pant
got a perspire that's the work gets me back to my required temperature range but the enormous
adaptive advantage provided by feeling is that if you are in a situation for which you do not have a
predetermined prediction for which there is not a phenotypic algorithm built into your brain then
the feeling tells you here and now whether you're heading in the right direction or wrong let me
take let me give you an example you're you're in a you're in a respiratory control is an automatic
process you don't need to be aware of of of of your need for oxygen in order to breathe it just
happens automatically but if you're in a building that's on fire and carbon dioxide is filling the
air then suddenly respiratory control becomes conscious and you feel this demand for work
in the form of an acutely unpleasant state of mind called air hunger or suffocation alone
now you're in a situation you've never been in before you can't possibly predict you've never
been in the burning building let alone this particular one and you can't possibly predict
what to do so that's a state of uncertainty with with with no predetermined predictions
and the way in which you solve that problem is to feel your way through it so if I go this way
and my air hunger gets worse that's bad it feels bad that means it's bad if I go the other way
and my air hunger reduces that's good that means I must go that way so the oxygenation in the air
is felt without there being any pre-ordained solution to this particular problem you feel
your way through it so feeling tells you how you're doing within this basic biological frame of
values scalar values which is that it's it's good to survive and bad to die and you feel what is
increasing and decreasing your chances your probabilistic chances of surviving by feeling
the feelings so that enables you to make choices and this too I cannot emphasize enough choices
have to be grounded in a value system something has to be better and something has to be worse
otherwise you have no basis for making a choice and feelings provide the value system which enables
choice in unpredicted novel situations so you decide which way to go on the basis of what
feels good and what feels bad without any cognitive knowledge as to you know what that drives the
cognition and and and you feel your way into your cognition so that what you're perceiving and what
you're thinking flavored colored driven by the feeling determines which which choices you make
that is the function of feeling that is what feeling adds to basic
automatized hominostasis now I've just identified one of the two most essential properties of
applet that is valence it feels good or it feels bad but I must add that it also has a categorical
quality each affect feels so so air hunger feels different from sleepiness feels different from
the need to urinate feels different from fear feels different from separation distress
feels different from thirst each of these has a flavor a categorical quality of their own
because you need to know what need is not is is being met or not being met so the color coding
or flavoring the qualification of these different affective needs is is why consciousness has quality
so consciousness in its basic form is inherently evaluative and it's inherently qualitative
and it does something what does it do it enables you to survive in unpredicted situations
which is an enormous adaptive advantage over creatures you do not have this capacity so
we're coming I notice I really have to end earlier than I would have liked but we're
coming to the crux of the matter which is that this is the function of feeling so remember
the question I was I was asking why and how is there something it's like to be an organism
something it's like for an organism well affect feeling explains why it's something
why it has to feel like something the feeling the quality of it and the category of it
is its very essence it's what it does is to bring to the awareness of the organism for the organism
how it's doing in terms of its literal potential to exist to continue existing its most basic
design principle the design principle that homeostasis embodies and this extended form
of homeostasis bringing to the level of awareness by the organism of its state as it's navigating
uncertain environments is the function of consciousness in its most basic form and going
back to charmes's claim that if you explain the function it doesn't explain why it feels like
something I'm saying that doesn't apply in the case of affect and affect is generated in the
brainstem which is the source of all consciousness all consciousness is contingent or dependent upon
brainstem consciousness now I'm going to end here so that this time for questions I just want to
let you know that in my book I then go on based on work I did with Carl Friston to explain
how that mechanism works mechanistically homeostasis is not complicated it can be reduced to laws and
if affect feeling is an extended form of homeostasis it too can be reduced to laws
and these laws are are explicated in the book and it explains how feeling governs
how voluntary action and learning from experience works in the brain I was going to tell you
this one last case but I don't have time so I'll just flick through and tell you read my book
please it's this is a complicated topic I can't begin to do it justice in a short talk like this
so why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience why doesn't all this
information processing go on in the dark free of any inner feel I hope you can see why I believe
that when it comes to feelings that they can't go on in the dark they can't go on without any inner
feel their very function their very causal contribution within the physical economy bodily
economy of the living organism is to feel and and and the feeling is what has the the the functional
causal consequences that charmers felt was so badly missing when it comes to perception and
cognition although he didn't realize that his argument applied only to perception and cognition
I am sorry I've had to rush at the end and I want to remind you in for that reason that I said
at the beginning only that I was going to give you a clue please read my book The Hidden Spring
Out Today in Britain and in a couple of weeks in America thank you very much I look forward to your
questions
you
