I'm sorry to tell you, it's not 42, it's not 41 or 43 either, it's that and it is quite
complicated isn't it. The one thing I think we could probably all agree about that is that
metabolism is scary and this is a metabolic map of our own metabolism and all the little dots,
the circles are molecules, different types of molecules and the lines that connect them up
are enzyme catalyzed reactions and so these are the metabolic pathways and flux is passing
through all of these things, this is what makes us alive and it's enormously complicated.
So how on earth can we begin to deconstruct it and make it simple so that I can understand it?
This is why I write books, I try to understand these things myself and if I can manage to
make it plain to myself then I think you can all understand it very easily as well.
So one thing to notice about this which is what all biochemists immediately notice on these
kind of charts is right in the middle of it there you'll notice there's a blue circle that kind
of stands out and says I'm different, that is the Krebs cycle and you have to say what on earth
is it doing there, why is it like that? If you look really carefully you'll see across to the right
hand side there's a in yellow there's another cycle there which is almost concealed that was
actually discovered by Krebs as well that's the urea cycle but that's kind of less central to all
of metabolism. So biochemists as a rule do not like asking why, they perceive it as a speculation,
rank speculation until relatively recently you were not allowed to ask why, you would never get a
job if you were to ask how, how does that work mechanistically what's going on and evolutionary
biologists they ask why and I'm a biochemist who loves evolutionary biology and and I look at that
and I say why oh why oh why, why is it so so complicated how can we deconstruct it? Well you
start by looking at the bits and this is the Krebs cycle as it's normally presented in textbooks
and it really doesn't get any better does it? I mean you look at the molecules themselves and these
seem to be fiddling rearrangements of bits of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and then there's all
these details of the different types of enzymes that do these different jobs and you look at it and
you think well I'm not going to become a biochemist so I'll go and do something else. Krebs himself
is of course famous, this is a painting of Sir Hans Krebs which was done for the Krebs Fest in
Sheffield in 2015 so this would have been 80 years after he went to Sheffield and he discovered
the Krebs cycle in 1937 when he was in in Sheffield and that's his his blackboard drawing
of the cycle he discovered back then. It's very difficult to convey how little we knew and how
difficult it is to you know you look at a cell down a microscope and you can see squidgy stuff
really and now we can see proteins right down to atomic levels of structure it's extraordinary
what we can see now but we still cannot see metabolism as it's happening we still cannot
see these molecules as they're going through a cell they're really just too small to see
in that way and so we have to imagine it and that's a really difficult thing again about
about biochemistry is you never really see anything you have to try and reconstruct it.
It's a little bit like detective work so what do these look like these molecules well I've pinned
a few out here they look a bit like a beetle collection and you know I think it was JBS
Haldane who who was asked what has all this study of biology taught him about about God and he said
well God had an inordinate love of beetles I think that God had an even more inordinate love of
carboxylic acids these are everywhere in cells this is basically if you if you think that life is
carbon based this phrase carbon based that these are the carbon skeletons that life is made from
these are really central to it I didn't bring my glasses and in any case you probably don't
really want to know there are slight differences between these molecules these are molecules in
the Krebs cycle and it says plus or minus 2h there's two hydrogen atoms have been pulled out or
added in between those molecules and you may think why on earth would you want to do that well I'll
come to that this though is what most people come to the conclusion medical students biochemistry
students this is basically all they can remember about the Krebs cycle and all they want to know
about the Krebs cycle and so we we tend to point poke gentle fun at it and sometimes at
professor Krebs himself who did occasionally set himself up as a target this is what it's all
about I'm going to spend a minute or two on this because we're going to see this kind of thing a
few times in this talk this is my attempt to simplify it down everybody should know this and
it is taught in schools what you're seeing here down at the bottom it says glucose it doesn't have
to be glucose it can be food of any description and it's broken down into smaller bits and I've
just marked up one bit there which is which is pyruvate and pyruvate broken down a little bit
more and it goes into the Krebs cycle I'm not going to try and attempt to explain what's happening
in the Krebs cycle step by step I do do it in the book and I try to make it as engaging as I can
but essentially you spin around the Krebs cycle and what's coming out carbon dioxide is coming out
and hydrogen is coming out it's not coming out as hydrogen gas is not bubbling out of there I've
written 2H and that 2H is stuck to another molecule called NAD, NADH nicotinamide adenus in there
nicotinamide adenine dinutliotide this is another problem with biochemistry all these difficult
names but actually all it's doing is passing on two hydrogen atoms where's it passing them to
is passing them into the membrane surrounding that you can think of this as a mitochondrion or as
a bacterial cell or as not one of your cells because the mitochondria are inside your cells but
that's 2H being split up I'll show you what happens in the moment but they're eventually
reacting with oxygen and that's what's generating all our energy in the form of ATP so that energy
this reaction between hydrogen and oxygen you can think of it as rocket fuel really this is
what's powering us this is what's making us alive in this slide is what makes us different to a corpse
you know there's no difference in information between a living person or someone who died a moment ago
the information content is exactly the same the difference is the flow of energy and the flow
of matter continuously going through and this is the core of all of that the Krebs cycle is spinning
continuously in all our cells notice there's a kind of a purple thing around that
around the membrane itself and I've got lots of little h plus signs there these are the protons
these are the charged nucleus of hydrogen atoms and what's happening the energy released from
this reaction between hydrogen and oxygen is used to pump protons across a membrane so don't worry
if you're a little bit scared of terms like protons but basically you've got a charge now on
that membrane I noticed there was a there was an email sent around by the RI yesterday and it started
out about Frankenstein and said you know we all think life is about electricity and actually no it's
not Nick Lane's going to come and tell you all it's all about chemistry well no I'm not I mean it is
actually it is about electricity not quite like Frankenstein but this this cycle the Krebs cycle
is linked to powering up a membrane so you have an electrical charge on the membrane and that
electrical charge on the membrane it's it's tiny it's 150 millivolts across the membrane so it's
not very much but if you were to shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule so that you were
the size of let's say a carbon dioxide molecule or something the the electrical force that you would
feel feel there is about 30 million volts per meter that's the field strength so that's equivalent
to a bolt of lightning fully enough which is what brought Frankenstein to life so we have this
and from Frankenstein's monster we have this going on in all our mitochondria in all ourselves
all the time now I've just drawn this circle to keep things simple this is what mitochondria
actually looked like and you can see they've got these very thin membranes these are called the
christian membranes and this is where all this proton pumping is going on so if you were to
iron out all of these membranes from from one of your from your own body
it would be about four football pitchers worth of membrane which is charged like a bolt of
lightning that's what makes us alive and that charge will flicker and die if it's not if we're
not keeping on turning the Krebs cycle so that's why the Krebs cycle is so central to what's going
on with life now what I'm just showing down at the bottom there is a kind of cartoon of this process
so that the two H the two hydrogen atoms are split into the component parts into electrons
and protons the electrons are passed in a kind of a wire inside the membrane so we have a current
of electricity inside the membrane flowing to oxygen that current of electricity powers the
extrusion of protons across the membrane so we have this electrical charge on the membrane
then they flow back through through through a turbine in effect the ATP synthase which is at the
right hand side so it's basically like a hydroelectric dam where the membrane is equivalent
to the dam the proton reservoir if you like is equivalent to the reservoir and the ATP synthase
well it's a it's a rotating motor it's an extraordinary protein this is another reason
why biochemists don't like to ask why how on earth does something with that you know majesty
evolve it's plainly a product of genes and natural selection and so on but when I think
about these questions I'm wondering about how did it arise in the first place it's a strange
fact but basically all life on earth works this way this way of generating electricity
is as universally conserved as the genetic code itself this is how cells work bacteria work this
way archaea work this way plants animals everything works this way so there's something profoundly
important about how it works and yet it's it's very difficult to wrestle with in terms of how
does it happen these are two of the most important discoveries in my opinion in the 20th century
of science one of them the the mitochondria themselves and the bacteria work in the same way
are basically electrical fuel cells was discovered by Peter Mitchell and I want to say
and Jennifer Moyle because Jennifer Moyle did all the experiments Mitchell was a genius
who who thought things that nobody else had really ever thought before but but a lot of people
thought he was a madman insane and really would practically leave the room if he came in he really
infuriated people it was Jennifer Moyle's experiments that that made other people take
Mitchell seriously and it's the sorry state of the world that Mitchell himself got the Nobel Prize
in 1978 but Jennifer Moyle was overlooked which I think would not happen today let's let's put it
that way the other person on there is Lynn Margolis she really nailed the idea that mitochondria
were once bacteria so mitochondria the power packs in our own cells once were free living bacteria
and were acquired two billion years ago probably in the course of the evolution of complex cells
and so these power packs that we have were once free living bacteria these are two of the most
important discoveries that again I think everybody should know but it suddenly gets a bit more messy
and the crept cycle is not only about stripping hydrogen out of food and burning it in oxygen
it's also used for making the precursors for everything else it provides the carbon
skeletons for growth it provides the carbon skeletons to make amino acids and to make
fatty acids and to make sugars and from those to make nucleotides the building blocks of DNA
and so on so it's it's really central to biosynthesis as well as to energy which is always
recognised in the textbooks but it's a little bit messy and uncomfortable and it's put into a
different chapter and we prefer not to talk too much about it um but there's a problem here
because if you have a problem with respiration it's not only affecting ATP synthesis the the energy
currency um it affects the the the electrical charge on the membrane if we can't if we can't have
the flow of electrons going to oxygen then you don't have the electrical charge on the membrane
then the crept cycle can't spin and then you can't make anything either so if you've got a problem
with respiration you've got a problem not only with energy but with really everything with growth
and development now luckily this doesn't really happen very much and I'll come later in the talk
as to why that is but the clue to what's going on actually came from cancer from studies on cancer
about in the last 10 to 15 years or so now it turns out what you're seeing here is that you can
I'm going to point to this um this is showing one of the complexes it's gone into reverse and we're
taking the 2h instead of taking them from the mitochondria we're taking them from over there
from the cytoplasm of the cell from outside the mitochondria we're feeding them into somewhere
else and that allows us to keep this electrical charge but notice what else is happening the crept cycle
is going backwards it's flipped and it's now taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen from around
it and converting it into um into the precursors for biosynthesis cancer cells love this cancer
cells want to make copies of themselves that's what they do they need to make it to grow and to divide
you need to have all of these you need to have more fatty acids for the membranes you need more
nucleotides for the DNA you need more amino acids for the protein so cancer cells do this
and it's become increasingly clear that this happens quite a lot so it becomes really very messy
this idea goes back to warburg auto warburg a great german biochemist really in the 1920s he began
talking about problems with mitochondria he wasn't bang on and actually this picture of him
he does look a little bit like dr frankenstein doesn't he but um he was a very polarizing
character a brilliant biochemist but extremely haughty and and um he was in fact crebs's mentor
as well um so so these ideas that are now very popular in cancer known as the warburg shift the
idea that mitochondria are effectively become biosynthetic rather than producing energy go back
80 years 90 years to to warburg and suddenly they're in vogue again and and and he wasn't
quite right about everything but he was right about a lot and i'll come back to that
what i'm trying to say is it's not a cycle it's more like a roundabout a magic roundabout with
things coming and going from pretty much every junction this is the magic roundabout in swindon
i've noticed when you try and find pictures of the magic roundabout in swindon you always find the
same picture um and it's quite an old picture look at some of the cars on there and you see
those are quite old cars so we're still reusing the same picture of the magic roundabout probably
because it's the only one where everyone was driving correctly around it i suspect i was there
once and it is a terrifying place um it really is difficult to organize that kind of flow so that
it actually works why on earth would life organize a system where you're using the same cycle
to generate energy and to make all the precursors for growth it seems a mad kind of thing to do
and if something goes wrong at any part of this because everything works in series then the whole
system goes wrong there's you know this seems like a mad way of doing now when things go wrong
a little bit it changes the activity of the genes there's an epigenetic switch so literally thousands
of genes are switched on or switched off when things go wrong with the crebs cycle and this is
something which is again being discovered over the last 10 years or so that if the concentration
of intermediates goes up or down then it switches genes on or off so it's you know far from just
the power packs of cells this is really the the the beating heart of what's going on with life
so why then do we use the same cycle for creating and destroying not even a phoenix
can do both at the same time well this is not the answer I put this slide in because today was
the last day of a postdoc in my lab glar in one one and he is going to take up a lectureship in
Thailand he is Thai leaving this weekend and so this is in Thailand I've got no idea where it
actually is but my god it looks nice I think this probably is the correct answer to pretty much
every other question it's as close to 42 as we're going to get but why do I say it's not the
correct answer because plants have misledders because plants the way that they do photosynthesis
they're basically making sugars that way and a lot of the chemistry it took a long time to
discover it and it was it's kind of focused in the way that textbooks teach and the way that we
are all taught biochemistry it's really you know I was I was helping my my my younger son who's got
his GCSEs coming up and it says in his textbooks that photosynthesis makes glucose well no not really
it actually took the people who were trying to work out the pathway they couldn't understand why
there was no glucose being made whatsoever it took them 10 years to figure out what was going on
well now we know and and so we've got this idea that that photosynthesis makes sugars
and respiration burns sugars and it all works as simply as that this is the correct answer
and it's not quite as nice really is it it's definitely less than 42 this is
this is in Yellowstone and these are green sulfur bacteria and they grow in a complete
they're photosynthetic as well but they grow in a completely different way and they grow in a way
which is far more ancient this is probably at least one to two billion years before the origin
of photosynthesis as we know it and here's what they do and this is the this is the key to everything
really what you see in there is the Krebs cycle again it's a slightly extended version of the
Krebs cycle and what's happening it's going backwards as it happens in cancer cells and it's
taking hydrogen it's taking it in fact from hydrogen sulfide in this case and it's taking
CO2 and it's joining them up to make organic molecules so one spin of the cycle takes up four
carbon dioxide molecules this is about four times more effective than the more familiar
Calvin Benson cycle which you see in most plants or all plants it was discovered in in 1966
and the first author on that paper was Mike Evans and there he is in 1964
with his car and that car really dates it though when I checked up I realized that the car was
actually already a vintage at the time it's a 1950 model so it kind of gives a slightly skewed
version but this is the reverse Krebs cycle first discovered in 1966 and it took literally 25 years
before the field began to believe it Krebs himself never referred to it Krebs died in 1981
he wrote a paper in 1981 about the evolution of metabolic pathways and he didn't once mention
the reverse Krebs cycle I have no idea why not but this really explains a great deal here was
the original figure showing how it works from that paper in 1966 at the left hand side and you'll
see there it says reduced ferrodoxin ferrodoxin it's the red protein and you can see just at the top
these are x-ray crystallographs showing the the electron density these are really beautiful
these figures you don't see them done like this very much anymore this is how they used to do them
this was a 1972 paper and you can see the structure that they came to from from the electron density
now can you just make out there's some square bits and you can see those the little kind of cuboid
lattices in there those are iron sulfur clusters so there's four iron atoms or irons and there are
four sulfur irons in there and it's a little cube structure like a mineral in effect and that
is the bit in this molecule that does the work there's two places in the Krebs cycle where it's
really difficult to make this chemistry happen and it's the ferrodoxin which is driving it and so
the entire cycle can go backwards and it's not involved in energy really it's involved in growth
in making things in making all the precursors that you need for life now this also 1966 was another
paper and this is perhaps one of the most important papers that i've ever read and probably Margaret
Dayhoff has anyone can we have a show of hands who knows Margaret Dayhoff's name Margaret Oakley Dayhoff
anyone in here John Allen does but i know he does but that's a real shame because because she is
really she was described as the father and the mother of bioinformatics and this was a paper
she founded this entire field which we now all comparing gene sequences letter by letter to say
well this from this bacteria compares with this from that bacteria and so on and we can reconstruct
an entire tree of life it all goes back to Margaret Dayhoff and this is an absolutely gobsmacking
paper i don't know if you can quite read the abstract but what she's saying there i can't read
the abstract because i forgot my glasses but but what she's saying there is that ferrodoxin this
molecule that makes the crebs cycle go backwards has a structure which is composed of smaller
repeating units in the end it goes down to four amino acids which are kind of repeated and repeated
and repeated and it became more complex and and these are some of the most ancient amino acids and
she says in there the bit that i've highlighted in in red says that perhaps this goes back to a time
at the origin of life before there was even a genetic code or before the genetic code was fully
formed which is one of the most thrilling lines that i've ever read in a scientific paper
and what she's what she's done there is is a kind of piece of detective work of looking at the modern
sequences deconstructing what makes them up realizing the the whole context for it and and pushing it
right back to the very origin of life it's a thrilling thing is it one of the great things
about science and and and and that's a challenge then so how could that work at the origin of life
she had also pointed to some of the most ancient bacteria clostridia and things like that
which grow from carbon dioxide and hydrogen in pretty much the same way as they don't actually
use the the reverse crebs cycle but they they use something very similar and so the reverse
crebs cycle is using hydrogen and co2 it's using ferrodox in this this this iron protein
and they also need to have the electrical charge on the membrane they can't grow
without this electrical charge so it's really simple chemistry that they're doing
and and this is um this is a tree of life built by you might say but bill would probably describe
himself bill martin here would probably describe himself as a disciple of of of margaret dayhoff
um and he has a very similar view that he's bringing in real biochemistry and and combining
it with with genetics and this tree of life that he's got here goes right back you can see down at
the bottom we have the bacteria in the archaea seeming to emerge independently from a hydrothermal vent
down at the bottom there now this was a radical radical view when he put that forward in 1999
that's this paper um and remarkably it's become i won't say mainstream but it's become far more
accepted now probably than than it certainly was when he when he put it out
the bacteria in the archaea that are down there at the bottom are growing from carbon dioxide
and hydrogen and the vents were discovered the year after that paper the kind of vent that he was
talking about by debora kelly who was captain of the alvin submersible the alvin submersible
had discovered black smokers in in 1978 so this was now moved forward to the year 2000 and she
discovered a completely new type of vent system known as alkaline hydrothermal vents and they're
not they're not like black smokers with with with smoke bellowing out of a chimney these are in
fact active vents but there's you don't see very much happening they're more like a kind of gothic
cathedral or something they're really beautiful things and they're really rich in hydrogen gas
hydrogen gas is bubbling out of the of these vents and they were predicted to exist 10 years before
their discovery by a guy called mike russell who's a geologist um and and he had found something
on land a kind of a fossil version and worked out what what should be happening in the oceans
and linked it to the origin of life so amazingly lateral thinking and the the key to how mike russell
was thinking about this is he was saying these these these vents have a a kind of mineralised
sponge texture to them it's it's it's a kind of a labyrinth of interconnected micropores and
the the walls between them today in the ocean at lost city discovered by deb kelly uh today
it's it's calcium carbonate aragonite but four billion years ago when there wasn't any oxygen
in the atmosphere they were probably made of other things the ocean chemistry was very different
and there were probably a lot of iron sulfur minerals in there with a structure which is very
similar to the iron sulfur clusters that uh margaret oakley was was talking about and and
involved in the reverse Krebs cycle they bubble hydrogen out of the ground the early oceans were
rich in co2 we've got these iron sulfur clusters and because the alkaline vents going into an
acidic early ocean we also have ph gradients so we have charges effectively electrical charge
on these barriers so we have really i think the you know the the the perfect set of circumstances
it's almost too perfect to be believable uh and the scientists we have to be skeptical and say
well am i seeing faces in clouds or something like that this is what gets me excited about it this
is on the on the left you're seeing a poor a kind of schematic of a poor in one of these
vents it's alkaline inside it's acidic outside there's a barrier around it it's quite a thick
barrier compared to a cell membrane and it's got these iron sulfur minerals in it and on the right
hand side we have a bacterial cell uh it's acidic outside it's alkaline inside we've got a membrane
and it's got a protein in it which is pumping protons out so topologically it's really very
similar and this is how i imagine it at least so and what i'm doing here is drawing it exactly
as i've drawn the other things just to show you how the topology works so on the left hand side
you're seeing the the poor with the iron sulfur barrier surrounding it it's driving hydrogen to
react with co2 in something amounting to the reverse krebs cycle it may not be a complete
cycle but it's basically driving this reaction and coming from it are the amino acids and the fatty
acids those are the easiest things to make the fatty acids will form together to make a membrane
and on the right hand side you're seeing that this membrane has formed around and now
everything's enclosed the concentrations are a bit higher the driving forces are the same
and so we can go further through metabolism and make more things make even perhaps nucleotides
that might seem like a bit of a farfetched claim to make uh it's far less of a farfetched claim though
than you might think this is probably the most complex slide that i'm going to show you this
evening and i'm not going to go through it in detail but all i really want you to take out
home from this is in i can't see it properly but in in in green if i remember rightly it says
h2 and in brown it says co2 maybe it's in maybe it's co2 in green right okay um these are the
steps starting with carbon dioxide and working through into metabolism as we know it into into
the krebs cycle as we know it and it's hydrogen hydrogen hydrogen carbon dioxide carbon dioxide
hydrogen it's just one after another it's exactly the same thing repeating chemistry
and you think well why is it doing this chemistry again i'm going to skip likely over this it's doing
this chemistry because it can't really do anything else when you think about what's happening with co2
binding close to a surface to a mineral surface or to a cell membrane perhaps or to a
metal cluster or something electrons are being transferred from the hydrogen where do they go
well i'm not going to go through step by step but what i would like you to take home from this is all
i'm doing is transferring electrons in the presence of protons and i'm going from carbon dioxide
in each step through to uh by the end of this slide i've got as far as a methanol so we're
transferring transferring an electrons onto it and then picks up a proton and we end up with one
hydrogen more electrons transferring on this is the electron pair is moving on to the oxygen
binds to a proton binds to a proton we end up with methanol and we can go on it's the same
chemistry if you would like to know more well i explain it more in the book but we've just taken
it through here in a few simple steps whoops to pyruvate itself which i showed you at the beginning
is the lead into the Krebs cycle in our own Krebs cycle but these are these are all the
intermediates this is the the building blocks of life and it's almost inevitable chemistry and it's
now being done in the lab pretty much everything i've just shown you over the last five years five
to seven years has now been done in the lab uh and it really works so i've been i've been talking
about these ideas for a long time for more than you know 10 to 15 years or so now and for a long
time it's a bit embarrassing because i would say well in theory all of this should happen uh and
but it's very difficult to make it work in the lab uh and and now not just in my lab but in other
labs around the world as well people are doing this chemistry it really does work it is fantastic
it's a very exciting time so um this is possible it's not proved but it's possible i'm gonna just
say one more thing before i move on from the origin of life which is that well to to to get
beyond there this is an entirely chemical system driven by the environment itself to get beyond
there well you need genes you need to be a proper cell this is not a proper cell this is a kind
of a proto cell with a with a non-coded metabolism where do the genes come from well there are known
interactions and i don't know quite how these work and i've just drawn some things for fun here
really but there are known interactions between between the the bases the nucleotides in in RNA
so the letters if you like of RNA and amino acids it's mostly about the hydrophobicity so if
the hydrophobic amino acid will interact with the hydrophobic base so water hating amino acids and
water hating bases and the size matters as well and what this means is that if we have these
interactions if we have a high enough concentration inside the proto cells then we can have we can
introduce a random sequence of RNA just any old letters you want meaningless no information
content whatsoever but if if if that will template in some way a non-random sequence of
amino acids to form a peptide and it's non-random because the biophysical interactions say whenever
you get this kind of hydrophobic base you'll get this kind of hydrophobic amino acid then you've
produced a non-random peptide which can have function because it can either make the proto
cell grow faster or grow slower and and if it's effectively it is coded by that sequence and
that sequence when it's copied can be passed on so I'm not going to say any more about that we can
ask questions later on if you want but in effect there is no problem with the origin of information
in biology if we think that metabolism comes first and that these kind of proto cells come first
everybody has to produce the building blocks but if you have just a pure RNA world where RNA
invents everything it's really difficult to work out where does all this information come from
there's no problem in this setting so uh let's skip forward they've left these cells have got
genes now and they've left and it's interesting that they they have retained cells have retained a
structure which is topologically similar to the planet itself um so the inside of the planet
the the the core and the mantle of iron rich and iron is effectively saturated with electrons you
might say it wants to be rid of those electrons and become oxidized um and the outside is relatively
oxidized lots of carbon dioxide and water and so on and the carbon dioxide will pick up
the electrons from the iron and the the the these things that I'm showing in the membrane there
is a membrane these these are hydrothermal vents really in the crust these are the connection
between the mantle and the the oceans and the atmosphere and the cells are basically exactly
the same relatively negatively charged inside relatively positively charged outside and they're
maintaining they're maintaining that difference it's important because for for these cells to grow
they need to get their hydrogen they always need hydrogen and they need to get it from
hydrothermal systems and they can't get it from anywhere else really at this stage they can
get it as hydrogen gas or they can get it as hydrogen sulfide coming out of these systems
or even ferris iron so so charged iron with with with two plus that can that can be oxidized
to ferricine it can rust in effect and the and the electrons and protons can produce hydrogen so it
works in all kinds of interesting ways but life is limited by the availability of the two h that I've
been talking about until photosynthesis and what photosynthesis does these are cyanobacteria what
photosynthesis does is take the two h from water it uses the power of the sun to strip out from
h2o it strips out the two h and it puts them into making organic molecules and oxygen is the waste
product and if you think about the earth as a battery as a giant battery then we're super
charging that battery the the outside the atmosphere and so on is now becoming even more
oxidized even more positively charged relative to the inside it really wants to draw electrons
out and those electrons are now coming from water instead that led to a kind of catastrophic change
in the history of the earth at the time of what's known as the great oxidation event 2.2
billion years ago um and this is just a beautiful picture of a banded iron formation I love these
things they're not actually diagnostic of the great oxidation event but they're beautiful to
look at the point is that oxygen appeared in the atmosphere around that time not very much I mean
limited amounts of it and a lot of the oceans remained really very low oxygen if it's probably
zero oxygen for another billion years or so after that but the thing is that when oxygen levels rise
we go well think about what the Krebs cycle is doing for two billion years all these bacteria
are just growing by taking two h out of the environment and so on and making the Krebs cycle
go backwards and that's how they grow and then there's oxygen in the atmosphere and everything
goes backwards forwards which way does it go I mean it flips direction and goes the other way you
you kind of think how can you avoid a crash when something like that is happening well the answer
the answer seems to come from the first animals in part so these are from around 560 million years
ago and these are the first trace fossils that have been found so this is before the Cambrian explosion
and and these are little worm like things that that crawls through the mud and the mud we know was
full of sulphide it was sewer gas really conditions and somehow they managed to they needed oxygen
to do this but they managed to deal with these sewer gas type conditions and it was a time when
oxygen levels were were rising and falling and quite unstable and it so how did they actually do that
well it seems that they didn't use a Krebs cycle as we know it necessarily they actually have a
two pronged kind of Krebs cycle and a lot of bacteria do this as well so rather than running
it as a cycle in either direction they kind of split it and they keep a balance there so I won't
go through the details of that but it's it's it's basically a way of keeping if you produce too
much to two h then then you become kind of saturated in it and you can't work and if you don't have
enough you'd be you're unable to burn anything and so this is a way of keeping a balance so you
have just the right amount now the interesting thing about these early animals is probably the way
that they succeed in doing it it took me a long time to see this blinding me obvious really but
it took me a long time to see it bacteria if you change the conditions have to keep changing their
state because you know if there's lots of sulphide around you have to deal with the sulphide you
switch these genes on and you switch those genes off you run your Krebs cycle this way and you're
okay and now it changes now there's some oxygen so you switch those genes off you switch these genes
on you switch the Krebs cycle and you do that what animals can do with different tissues is have
this tissue doing one job that tissue doing a different job this tissue supporting that one
and so on so we have different patterns of flux going different ways of making the Krebs cycle
operate I think this was probably one of the things that really made the cambrian explosion
possible this differentiation of tissues we think about them as doing different jobs but
all of those jobs are supported by the way that the Krebs cycle is working so this is a picture
I've always liked showing the Ediacaran fauna at the left hand side so these we don't really know
what they were their seasile filter feeders stuck to the bottom of the ocean in the often 200 meters
down so too deep for them to be photosynthetic they look a lot like plants but they they're too
deep it's pitch black 200 meters down so they're not plants and they all died out the reason we
don't know much about them is that they fell extinct right before the cambrian explosion and they
probably fell extinct because we know that there was a time where the sulfide levels rose around
then and they probably just suffocated and those first animals that I showed you crawling through
the mud dealing with sulfide were effectively pre adapted to those conditions they got different
tissues that were doing different jobs and they were able to survive those changing conditions
and oxygen levels rose around the time of the cambrian explosion and so suddenly
what we're seeing there is predators and prey we're seeing armor plated animals and they're
scuttling around and eating each other and you can't do that without oxygen and the simple reason
for that is you can't really have multiple trophic levels in the absence of oxygen because of the
efficiency so aerobic respiration is about 40% efficient and what that means is that you extract
about 40% of the energy from the lunch that you eat and the rest is waste and then another trophic
level will extract 40% of the energy from that so an aerobic ecosystem can support five or six
trophic levels whereas an aerobic one where it's more driven by fermentation is about 10%
efficient in comparison so you can only have two at most three trophic levels and that means
predation really just doesn't pay you never have large enough population sizes so the cambrian
explosion we know from geological evidence and we know from the types of behavior that these cambrian
animals were predators and would have had a crebs cycle just like our own and would have had the
same problems that we have with it you can be fairly certain that they would have shown signs of
aging and things like that so I'm showing you here again the the full crebs cycle that I showed
you before there's the full system where we have where eating food glucose whatever it is with
spinning the cycle in an oxygenated atmosphere where charging the membrane we have an electrical
charge on the membrane the trouble is you can't do that forever you are going to end up with damage
just the turnover the pace of life you will get damaged protein you can replace the damaged
proteins fine you can fix everything if you want to but this is this is the obsession
of evolutionary biologists you will never see an evolutionary biologist who is not obsessed with
sex so how much effort do we want to put in to sex and what you can see behind is pacific salmon
they put all their effort into sex and then undergo what's known as catastrophics in essence
they drop dead right afterwards in piles they put everything into it for the sake of their offspring
in effect now we all do the same thing to some extent not catastrophically but we have to make
some kind of evolutionary decision how much repair do we want to do because the more repair we do
then the fewer offspring we're going to have because we've devoted more resources to that rather than
this you have to take the pick to some extent and so different animals make that decision in
different ways some put much more resources into extending their lifespan and others put much
more resources into sex immediately if you like um the problem is this is again you've seen this
before this is just showing if we if we're accumulating damage if we've if we've made a
decision well we're going to put most of our effort into sex and some into surviving a little
bit longer you're going to get damage and that damage some of it's going to be in respiration
and when you get the damage and respiration then you're going to have a problem with the
entire system because it's all linked in series and I showed you this before as well with Warburg
now it turns out that this is not just specific to cancer cells this is more or less what's
happening in a lot of our cells as we get older and the reason is the damage so again you can see
um am I painting it I should have painted that one blue um but anyway if we have damage here and
we have some flux of protons back we're putting the Krebs cycle into reverse again I'd like to
call this a wiring diagram for being old because what you're seeing here is is less energy because
we're we're cutting out the first so instead of pumping 10 protons we're pumping six protons so
for for for every 2h that we have we get less ATP out so we're we're losing energy in comparison
and we're spinning the Krebs cycle backwards so we are beginning to put on weight we're fixing
co2 as if we were plants or something we're putting on weight and and and getting slower and
that is the the essence of aging now also it makes us more vulnerable to cancer and the diseases
of old age so rather than having a forwards operating Krebs cycle we're getting something
much more sluggish like that it's not necessarily pumping it out that way it's much more subtle
than that and this can last for decades this kind of state so there are though some cells which
can't do that so these are pancreatic beta cells and this is this is amazing to me they they need
they detect glucose and they when when glucose levels rise in the bloodstream they put out insulin
and that uh that that that lowers the the glucose levels again how do they detect glucose well
they detect glucose by effectively having a flux capacitor system so they allow glucose to flow in freely
and they allow the Krebs cycle to to to spin freely and that generates a membrane potential so it
charges up the electrical membrane and if you have a highly charged membrane that's the signal
to put out insulin now if you have damage to respiration and you cannot highly charge your
membrane you know that there's glucose signal coming in and you can't be spinning the Krebs cycle
in that way so you you can't do it so you don't put out the insulin so you end up with hypoglycemia
and you end up with diabetes now it's not just those cells it's also neurons neurons love
glucose they can get by on ketones and things as well but they were really reluctant to burn
amino acids or fatty acids or other things like that why well they have the same regardless
of what the reason why is i'll come to that in a moment they have the same problem as they get
older then you you're going to be losing power if you're not careful now if you if you face that
situation if you stick with glucose and you can't burn the glucose because you don't have a full
Krebs cycle well you won't be able to think um so what are you going to do well this is an idea
coming from um from uh from Eric Shown uh and Estella Ariagomez which is a very neat idea I
don't it's not a very popular idea in the field I have to say but I I think they they're on to
something what they're saying is that you ramp up the calcium because the calcium you can you can
ramp up the rates of respiration and the charge on the membrane so pump some more calcium if you
don't have enough glucose pump some more calcium in and you can charge up your membrane a little bit
more and it works except that calcium can be damaging and it's especially damaging
to the place where the calcium sources which are the membranes right next to the mitochondria
called the mams the mitochondria associated membranes now this is part of another membrane
system called the endoplasmic reticulum and this is making proteins and processing proteins and a
lot of the proteins that you'll be familiar with in Alzheimer's disease so uh you know you you'll
see plaques and tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease the plaques are made
from an amyloid protein and the amyloid protein is made is is a small part from a processed
precursor protein the amyloid precursor protein all of that chopping up proteins and and sorting
them out is happening in the mams in these membranes right next to the mitochondria and are
damaged by the calcium because the mitochondria themselves are not working correctly is he right
is she right I don't know um but it makes a lot of sense to me but the other reason I like this
and this is the last few minutes now the other reason I like this is it says it's really
important to have a high membrane potential when glucose floods into a brain area so you can see
on the on pet scans and things the parts of the the brain lighting up when glucose comes in so
it's gated the capillar is open the flow glucose comes in this part of the brain lights up we're
getting a big electrical charge on the mitochondrial membranes um and we seem to really need that
charge is it connected with things perhaps even more important than just thinking or just the
mechanics of thinking is it connected with consciousness itself this is a really beautiful
idea from lucaturin now lucaturin is a biophysicist and he's he's had all kinds of
interesting ideas I'm not going to talk about most of them but he came and visited me at UCL
a few years ago now and wanted to talk about general anaesthetics and I knew nothing about
general anaesthetics but what he told me is that well nobody knows anything about general
anaesthetics we don't know how they work they all have different shapes and they all have you
know different charges and none none of them interact in a meaningful way with the kind of
the hand and glove type receptor mechanism and that was what interested him even xenon he said
an inert gas which is basically a sphere of electron density it doesn't really have a shape
it doesn't really have any chemistry but it does have physics he said and this physics involves
somehow I don't really know how it does it is able to transfer electrons and what he had shown
using EPR and techniques like that so electron paramagnetic resonance is that oxygen is involved
the transfer of electrons to oxygen xenon speeds it up and that is associated with why it can put
you under general anaesthesia it short circuits respiration it can only do it in a very mild way
because if it did it in a big way it would kill you straight away so it must be a very subtle
effect but you know if you get an overdose of a general anaesthetic it will kill you so it's
there's some subtlety probably these things are actually quite bad at doing it and therefore
are less likely to kill you but they do it somewhat anyway now we don't know either many things
where it really profoundly ignorant about we don't know what the electroencephalogram is we know that
it's we can interpret it really well but we don't know what structures in the brain are producing
the electrical fields that are giving the EEG we know it's neurons and we know it's not just
single neurons it's networks of neurons because the signals are sufficiently high that they must
come from networks but the assumption in the field is that it's coming from the from the
axonal membranes from the from the plasma membranes themselves which are depolarizing as a as a
neuron is firing but inside the neurons are mitochondria and there's a lot more mitochondria
and the charges at least double the charge on the plasma membrane and we have these beautiful i
showed you earlier on these beautiful um christi membranes they're often parallel to each other
and we have an oscillating current in them they do generate electromagnetic fields it's really
difficult to measure them i am trying to think of ways of doing it other people are trying to think
of ways of doing it but it's quite likely it seems to me that the electromagnetic fields generated
that we're detecting with the EEG are generated by the mitochondria inside cells rather than
the membranes themselves and that they're interacting with the fields on the on the plasma membrane
and and and this is going on so why mitochondria and why electromagnetic fields and this is the
final slide that i'm going to leave you with and this is the first slide that i showed you pretty
much as well this system now think of it as a bacterium and it's got the Krebs cycle it's generating
the amino acids and everything it needs all the precursors and it's burning things in oxygen
and it's taking up glucose or whatever from the environment and it's charging up the membrane
and this system is working in series so everything is connected in time and as time goes by as oxygen
levels fall then respiration will slow the membrane potential will fall and so moment by moment in the
life of a bacterial cell and i'm showing you a bacterial cell here the stream of consciousness
is in effect the the a real time report on the status of the cell in relation to its environment
i'm not saying anything about the human consciousness i'm just saying what from the point of view of
biophysics is a feeling if we feel in love or if we feel pain or if we feel hungry or whatever
it may be what is what what is a feeling we don't know there is no there is no answer to that and
there are really two types of explanation for it one of them is it's some kind of concoction
it's an emergent property of a sufficiently complex central nervous system but it still
doesn't say what it is and actually what that says is there's some deceit going on that it's not real
it's uh is just a concoction to trickers into thinking that we're conscious i don't find that very
appealing as an idea the alternative idea is that well it's a property of matter that there's
an unknown law of physics and the sun is conscious in some way or another and so is everything else
and i don't find that really very believable either consciousness strikes me to be widespread
across at least the animal kingdom it seems to me anybody who has a pet will recognize that it has
um feelings um and why where do we stop then what is natural selection acting on to embellish
consciousness going from simpler animals to in the end the majesty of the human consciousness
what is the simplest possible form of consciousness that we can imagine what is
if you like a quantum of solace what is the the the simplest possible form i think
is the electrical charges on the membranes generated by the spinning of the krebs cycle
in relation to the environment as a real time report on the status of cells in relation
to their environment i'm going to stop there i have to say thank you to my group because
they are doing amazing work i haven't presented any data this evening um i normally give kind of
quite data heavy talks i have to say these days they are brave they're working on some of the
most amazing questions in science but they're not easy questions and it can take a long time to
make much progress um and and and that can kill a career and that's why i say you have to be brave
if you do a phd and you don't know papers and every result you get over three or four years is
negative uh well that's not great you know you may be forced to leave science so it requires some
bravery to to do that and i'm really grateful to them for for coming for this adventure and making
this adventure for me so much more thrilling because we are making progress and i think we're
beginning to understand things and i'm going to leave just with the painting of the reverse
krebs cycle by Audran Oelle as an oryboros i hope i've done that in time yes 80 o'clock fantastic
