So tonight I'm going to take you through some of the highlights of my new book, this is
the lovely front cover, the spike and epic journey through the brain in 2.1 seconds.
So if you're all sitting comfortably, then without further ado, start with the brain
itself. So behold, your brain. So you can tell which end is the front because that's
where the eyes are located. And as you probably know, your brain is made up of neurons. In
fact, your brain is made up of many, many neurons. Our best estimate is that your brain
is made up of about 87 billion neurons. So you'll forgive me that I couldn't quite get
all 87 billion on this slide. And it is these 87 billion neurons talking to each other,
sending messages to each other that underpin everything that you do. They underpin everything
you perceive, everything you think and everything that you do to act. So it's these neurons
talking to each other that have underpinned the literary outpourings of the Bronte sisters,
of Shakespeare, of Dickens, and of course the incomparable literary genius that is Dan
Brown. These neurons talking to each other have underpinned all the greatest creative
acts of our best painters, of our greatest mathematicians. And of course, these neurons
talking to each other have underpinned all the greatest physical prowess, including, of course,
some of the greatest foot bling minds that we have. And of course, these neurons talking to
each other and the messages they pass each other have underpinned all the deepest insights of
all the deepest thinkers throughout history. So everything our brain does is carried out by
these 87 billion neurons talking to each other. In the one language, the brain understands the
passing of these electrical impulses, these spikes of my title will come to in a minute.
So if we want to understand the brain, we need to understand that language.
So I'm going to tell you tonight about the language of the brain, about who's doing the
talking and what it means when they do. So let's begin by reminding ourselves of the thing that's
doing the talking, so the neuron. So the neuron is made up of three major parts that you need to
know about in order to understand what's going on here. So at the top of the neuron are the dendrites.
The dendrites are these big tree-like protrusions that stretch out away from the neuron, sending
these protrusions out into the rest of the brain to collect the inputs from other neurons in the
brain. But those neurons connect to those dendrites. And those dendrites send all that input down
into the neuron's body. That body is where all these inputs meet. It's where these inputs added
up, integrated, summed together. And should that neuron want to send its own signal out to
bring up its own inputs to another neuron, it sends that signal down its axon, this long cable
that stretches away from the neuron to connect to neurons both near and far, and send its own
signal onwards. So those signals are these things I've been calling spikes. So in neuroscientists,
call them spikes. And partly because they just look spiky. They're a rapid jump and fall in
voltage that look very much like this when you see them on a oscilloscope. They last about two
milliseconds. And they are the thing that sweeps down the axon of the neuron to go and connect,
send messages to other neurons. And the creation of a spike is quite simple. So two are neuron.
A whole bunch of neurons will send their spikes. Those spikes will arrive at the end of their axon
and connect to the dendrites of that neuron. But they won't jump onto the other neuron. There's
a little gap between the axon and the dendrites. So the spike arrives, causes a little chemical
cascade across this little gap. And on the other side, on our main neuron that we're looking at,
there'll be a tiny flicker of its voltage. And then if there are enough flickers of its voltage
upwards to a certain point, to a certain threshold, then that neuron will in itself create its own
spike that will be sent down its axon. So that means really we need two things to make a spike.
We need lots of spikes arriving at that neuron coming from lots of neurons. So a spike then
being sent by one neuron is really measured saying, I have received lots of input just now,
roughly at the same time, and this needs to be communicated to the rest of the brain.
So spikes are how neurons talk to each other. Neurons talking to each other then are, as we said,
how you do anything. So sending receiving spikes underlies this thinking, the planning, the feeling,
the sleeping, the eating, moving, breathing, your heart rate, everything that you do and your body
does for it. So which means that you live a life in spikes. So your cortex, that sheet of neurons
that lives around the outside of your cerebrum, contains in humans about 17 billion neurons.
And we estimate that on average, each of those neurons is sent about one of these spikes every
second. So as you'll see later, actually, a number send rather, rather more than that,
a number send rather less than that. But on average, it is one spike every second.
Now the UN tells us that the average lifespan of a human on this planet right now is roughly
70 years. So that means that during the average human lifespan, in cortex alone,
one lifetime means about 34 billion, billion spikes. And it means, of course, many, many
billion more in all the neurons that are not in cortex, all the neurons blow in the rest of the
brain. So this is a truly staggering biography. It's a biography of everything that you do is
lived in through these 34 billion billion spikes in your cortex and billions below.
And those 34 billion billion spikes in cortex are such a huge number, they are in fact bigger
than the number of words ever printed and published in English since the invention
of the printing press. And all is a magnitude bigger. So they are quite the extraordinary
biography of your life. So in my book, round right there, the entire biography of 34 billion,
billion neurons sent over 70 years, concentrated on just two seconds. And in those two seconds,
there are still then these 34 billion spikes being passed through your cortex. So even that
was quite an undertaking. So tonight I'm going to tell you about three of the arguments I raised
in this book. The first one is that knowing spikes is messages passed between neurons is
essential to understand the brain. So I'm going to, if I'm not convincing you that already, I'm
going to shortly take you on a tour of cortex to look at three different ways in which understanding
spikes has been essential to understanding how bits of the brain work. And if we accept the premise
that knowing spikes is essential to how the brain works, then it follows that to always
understand how the brain works, we need to solve many of the mysteries of spiking,
of how spikes are created and what happens to them and what they mean. I'm going to draw on a
couple of those later on. And if we accept the premise that knowing spikes is essential to
understanding the brain, then it follows then that there are some fundamental limits on how
well we can understand your brain, the human brain. And at the end, I'll explain what I mean by that.
Right. So let's begin. We're talking about why spikes, knowing spikes is essential to understand
the brain. I'm going to do that by talking about what a spike means in three things that you do
every day. So seeing and deciding and remembering. Okay, the case of remembering
short-term memory things, we just holding them in mind for a brief period of time.
So to do that, I'm going to take you for a little tour of cortex. So here again,
is your cortex. Now divide it up into five of the sections that we typically use to describe
bits of your cortex. And we're going to start with seeing. And seeing involves a bit of the cortex
that sits right at the back of your cortex here in the visual cortex. Now, instead of a scenario
where your eye falls upon something that you really, really want. So for example, that it falls
upon a really delicious looking cookie right ahead of you. So photons are going to bounce off this
cookie, come into your eye, crash into the retina at the back of your eye. And the job of the retina
is to turn those photons into spikes. So it turns them into spikes and those spikes are
bent out of the retina into the rest of cortex. Now in your cortex,
there are going to be neurons in your first bit of your visual cortex that are looking at
every kind of little pixel of that image. So here I've drawn a tiny little white square
on the image, which is just the top of one of these chocolate chunks.
Indeed, those are the horizontal line, the top of one of the chocolate chunks in that cookie.
And correspondingly, there will be neurons in the first bit of visual cortex that can see just
that pixel of the image. So if we then go and record neurons in that through the brain
and see what spikes they send, then we'll see something like this. So as we show them
lines of different angles, so if we show them a line that is vertical and then which slowly
rotates around to the horizontal before rotating back around to the vertical again,
it will send a different amount of spikes according to the angle of the line we're showing it.
So if we show it a purely vertical line, it sends almost no spikes whatsoever.
And slowly as we rotate that line back to the horizontal, it will send more and more spikes.
And as we rotate it past again, it will send fewer and fewer. So what this means is that this neuron
will send its most spikes when it sees a horizontal line in the tiny pixel of space that it gets to
look at. So in this case, it's looking at a tiny pixel of space where there is this horizontal line
or this time chocolate chip. So we expect there to be in that the neurons looking at a bit of
space, a whole bunch of them who really like these horizontal lines will be sending a lot of spikes.
So the very first neurons in visual cortex, what their spikes mean, is that there is an edge
of the type they like, in this case horizontal line, in the part of space that they happen to be
looking at. Of course, all parts of the image you can see will have their own sets of neurons
looking at them. So here I've drawn just nine of these pixels. You have to imagine, of course,
the whole image that you can see in front of you will be tiles. There will be lots of pixels
close to where your phobia is looking, really concentrated on, and fewer further away.
And each of those bits of space will have neurons in them that are responding to
energies of different types. So the first set of neurons respond to an edge in that part of space,
what are the next neurons responding to? So imagine that
we have two pixels of space, those two squares drawn on the left hand side here,
and we have just in a moment two neurons looking at them. So we have the neuron at the top,
you can see the top pixel of space, the neuron at the bottom, you can see the bottom pixel of space.
Neuron at the top, he really likes edges like this. So kind of edges that lean a bit to the left,
the bottom left hand corner of his pixel, and it will send lots of spikes when it sees that kind
of edge. Neuron at the bottom, it really likes edges which are back here in its pixel of space,
so slightly to the right, kind of in the middle of the pixel.
So now we imagine those two neurons, they converge on another neuron further along
in the visual system, so perhaps in the second region of visual cortex, which we commonly call V2.
So imagine now that those two neurons are sending spikes to this neuron that they
both converge on. If that neuron itself then sends a spike downstream, what does that spike now mean?
Well, it means that that neuron at the top saw the edge that it liked, and that neuron at the
bottom saw the edge that it liked. So by this converging set of spikes on this neuron, that neuron
now means there's a corner. And this reinforces this idea that meaning is really spikes from many,
many neurons. The meaning here of a corner is a collision of spikes from across a whole range of
neurons, looking at different pixels, which are sending lots of spikes about the fact that they
can see the edges they like in those pixels, and they converge on a neuron which puts that
information together to say it's a corner. And then you can imagine that extrapolates then
out to more and more neurons further than further into the visual system. So if we put together
little edges into corners, into longer lines, into curves, and then those neurons that are
sending spikes saying there's a corner or a small edge or a long edge or a curve,
and those are combined together, then we can start getting the outlines of objects.
And if we have lots of edges or lines at the same angle across an image, that's a texture.
And then if we can also respond to the fact there is different colors, so here green,
then that's color. You put together edges and textures and color, and you have objects.
You can see then that spikes from neurons ascending parts of the visual system,
going from meaning simply an edge to meaning corner to meaning objects, is how the visual
system seems to carry information in the spikes from its neurons. So that was a very brief example
of how the visual cortex, neurons in the visual cortex, can carry meaning in their spikes.
Let's hop up now to this region called the parietal cortex. And here we're going to look at neurons
which seem to be involved in making a decision. Now there's lots of different neurons in parietal
cortex respond to loss from things in the world, so we're going to concentrate on the ones that
seem to be involved in making a decision. Okay. And particularly the kind of decisions
which involve some kind of accumulation of evidence, some kind of
situation where you are adding up the evidence for or against something in which you need to
make a decision about it. So in the lab what we typically do to help you measure making a decision
is we have humans and animals look at something which has got a random motion of dots on it.
So a little circle in which lots of dots are moving around. So in this schematic what I'm
showing you is that in this case more or less half the dots are moving to the right. So if the dots
are at the start of the white circle they move to where the black circle is. And all the human or
the animal looking at this moving dots has to do is decide whether the movement of the dots is
mostly to the right or to the left. So when we ask that question of humans that's very simple
they just have to press a button that's on the right or press a button that's on the left
to make their decision. When we give this task to animals we have to ask them to look
to the right or look to the left. Once they have watched this long enough accumulated enough
evidence in order to make a decision of whether it's going to the left or to the right.
One reason why we use this random dot motion task is because it's really easy to change whether
it's an easy task or a hard task. So I'm going to show you two examples of what this stimulus looks
like. So this is what it looks like when it's easy. So hopefully what you can see in this slightly
flickery gif, apologies the flickers, is that if you look at it your brain can quickly see that a
little bunch of the dots moving are moving rightward. So this is really easy. It's really easy because
these dots are really coherent. So in this case I think about 50% of the dots are moving to the
right. So it becomes very easy for our visual systems to work out under prior to cortex to
work out. So it's moving to the right. However we can make it a lot harder. I'm going to show you
another one and I'm going to see what you think whether it's moving to the left or the right.
So watch this for a while. It's got a loop again in the moment. There we go.
So left or right.
The answer of course is neither. This is as hard as it gets. So here none of the dots are
coherently moving either to the left or the right. They're moving more completely randomly.
I would like to throw in these cheat ones for animals and humans because when we throw this in
and we force them to make a decision anyway, force them to make a decision about whether we're
going right or left, then whatever is happening in the brain in this process will ease the decision
of going right or left because there is no actual physical perceptual evidence of it going to left
or right. So we'll be able to see what's happening in the brain just making the decision. Okay.
So that's how we, one of the many ways, the most popular way I'd say, of how we examine a decision,
simple decision, in the lab. So what happens then if we record from the neurons in prior to cortex
when we're doing this? Right. So we're going to record from a bunch of neurons looking at these
moving dot displays. So imagine the moving dot display is showing dots mostly moving to the right.
Okay. And we're recording from a neuron that really likes things moving to the right.
Then what we'll see when we record from it, record from it a lot, record from lots of these
neurons and then we average over them, is we'll see something like this. So on the
bottom axis, it says time until decision. So that zero is the time at which
the decision was made on every viewing of the video by the animal. Okay.
And then we're plotting the activity, the spike sent by that neuron up to that decision time.
So what you can see, that y-axis is rate of spikes, the number of spikes is sent
per second, is that the number of spikes these neurons send on average
consistently goes up until a decision is reached. As soon as the decision is reached,
the eye moves to the right or the left, then in this case, we'll move to the right because
this is a neuron that likes the right, then it will drop, the activity will drop almost a zero.
Okay. So it looks like all these neurons, spikes are standing for, are standing for
the accumulation of evidence. As it's saying, watching this dot motion picture, it says though
it's counting up, the number of dots you can see moving to the right and going,
yes, I think they're moving to the right. I think they're moving to the right. Yes,
yes, yes. I'm definitely sure they're moving to the right.
What would happen though if we recall from a neuron that didn't like rightward ones,
what happened if we recall from a neuron that liked things moving to the left instead?
Well, in that case, what we see is something like this.
We see that number of spikes it sends slowly, slowly, slowly falls and then suddenly falls
on average, averaged over many neurons, averaged over many, many views of this, this stimulus.
And that looks all the world as though it's a neuron that's
looking at the evidence against its hypothesis, against the fact that it's moving left.
So we now have examples of two neurons. One that looks like accumulating evidence for a
hypothesis, the hypothesis being, is moving to the right and neurons accumulate evidence
against hypothesis, hypothesis that is moving left.
Another way we can check that this is actually something like accumulation of evidence is,
of course, as I showed you earlier, we can make this harder or easier.
And in fact, what you're looking at there for this rightward looking neuron, the stuff in
gray, the one that's accumulating up, is actually what it looks like when we give it
the hardest decision to make. When the dots are not actually moving in any direction,
that's where it looks like when it makes the decision to go right anyway.
And then the more the current will make the dots, the easier we make the task,
the faster the activity will go up like this. So in blue, at the dark blue at the top there was
the increasing activity I already showed you. So it goes up and up and up and up and up,
number of spikes being sent, increases and increases and increases up to the top.
And then the colors going down and down to the yellow
correspond to the making easier and easier. So more and more dots are moving in the same
direction. And so the easiest one in yellow there is when it's 50%, the easiest thing I showed
you at the start, one that's really obvious. As you can see, what happens is,
is that extremely easy, the number of spikes per second goes up extremely fast and makes the
research that sort of seems to be a threshold for the decision almost immediately. And the harder
you make it, the slower the evidence is accumulated, which is exactly what we
hope to see if we really thought that these neurons were accumulating evidence.
Because of course, there should be accumulating faster, the easier it is to do the task.
So we believe then that neurons in parietal cortex, some of the neurons in parietal cortex,
their spikes mean accumulated evidence for a decision.
Okay, that's the second stop on our tour. That's spikes that
mean things about our decision. The final stop now tour a little tour of cortex.
It's going to be in the mysterious zone in front here called the prefrontal cortex.
And here, we're going to be talking about keeping things in mind. Okay, so the kind of
short term memory kind of where you're holding things in mind, things like where you put your
keys just now, did I lock the door or what number someone just said to me was, what the phone number
someone just said to me was. So in prefrontal cortex, we can find neurons whose spikes seem
to stand for these kinds of short term memory. And I'm going to show you an example of that now
from some work that we did in my lab. So this work was done by my postdoc,
Ciovi Mangi, who may well be in the call tonight, in collaboration with our great friend,
Adrian Peresh, who did the experiments about the show you, which we then analyzed.
So in Adrian's experiments, he had a rat learning to get reward on a Y maze.
So I know it doesn't look much like a maze. So neuroscientists call anything with walls
on a corridor a maze. But this is what we call a Y maze. So in this Y maze,
the rat's task is really simple. So he has to
wander up to this point here, decide whether to go right or to go left.
Once he's made his decision, get to the end, he makes the correct decision, he gets a reward.
And what the correct decision is, that's what he's going to find out.
So the first time these rats enter the maze, the correct decision is to go to the left.
So they run up and down the maze many, many times, and this goes to the left.
Do they ever something go to the left, they get the reward. In this case,
it's not actually cheese, it's chocolate milk, because rats adore chocolate milk.
Once they've learned, go to the left, what they then have to learn is a new rule. So
unbeknownst to them, the rule is changed. So they then have to go instead to the arm,
left or right arm, where the light is switched on. So the lights are on a random order, left or
right. So has to go to where the light is on. So no matter what his choice was, though,
what is his edit reward, what it's got to do, it's got to turn around
and trudge all the way back to the start again, in order to be allowed another chance
to make his choice. So every time it runs up, goes to the left or goes to the right,
he has to turn around and trudge all the way back in order to make his choice.
So we took advantage of a slight flaw in the rats behavior here
to ask this question. So what was he thinking about on the way back? So while the rats were
doing this, Adrian had been recording the whole time neurons in their prefrontal cortex,
something between 12 to 55 neurons at the same time in prefrontal cortex, the spikes coming
out. And as we already know from various experiments, the prefrontal cortex should
be the bit where we hold things in mind, because, for example, we can remove dopamine
temporarily from that part of prefrontal cortex, and animals doing taskful short-term memory
unable to do them for a while. Then we could ask, okay, those neurons were recorded from
in prefrontal cortex, can we look at their spikes they're sending and work out what he was thinking
about on the way back, if anything? What's really nice here is that although the rats
ran up really, really quickly when they went up to go left or right, took about four seconds,
on the way back, they took over a minute typically. So we had over a minute's worth of
spikes being sent by these neurons to have a good look at and see all that time.
What was he thinking about on the way back? So, for example, what's he thinking about,
whether he'd got reward or not? So he might be trudging back really, really happy,
having just made the correct choice and got some reward, just drunk his chocolate milk,
trudging back, thinking, excellent. What was he trudging back thinking, oh, I got nothing,
and having to walk all the way back again? So, what we wanted to do then was what we wanted to
look at, the spikes being sent by these groups of neurons that had been recorded in prefrontal cortex.
So here I'm showing you three neurons for illustration. Of course, as I said, we record
it somewhere between 12 and 55, well, Adrian recorded between 12 and 55. So, what we wanted
to ask was, could we find if there was a way of reading out what he was thinking about? For example,
could it be that as it was trudging back after it had just got a reward, these three neurons here
were sending a pattern of spikes like this? So the first neuron was sending lots of spikes,
and the other two neurons were sending a few spikes while I was trudging back after it had
got a reward. And then after it had not got a reward, oops one way, after it had not got a reward,
were those same three neurons sending different pattern of spikes. So now with the first neuron
sending only a one or two, and the other two are sending considerably more than they did
after it got a reward. So what we wanted to ask was, can we look across the spikes and
put all of these neurons and work out whether or not it had just got a reward as it was trudging
back to the start. So I'm going to show you what we found. So to do that, for testing for a memory
of reward, we divided the maze up into five chunks so we could look at how that memory changed as
you walk back. So actually this graph I'm going to show you is the maze on its side. So we need to
turn the maze on its side like this. So the reward, the bit where it gets its reward is that position
one, the bit where it made its choice is at round position three, and the bit where it gets back to
the start again, position five. So just to show you that again, which reward, position one,
the choice point three, gets back to the start, position five. So walking back,
as walking back, it goes one, two, three, four, five. Okay. Right. You shove that underneath,
you can look at it for reference. So what we're going to ask in each of these five locations,
we're going to ask, how would we do? If we take across these groups of neurons, so say one of
the recordings where they had 32 neurons in it, we looked at the spikes for each of those 32 neurons,
could we tell whether the animal had just got reward or not just by looking at the pattern
of spikes sent? Maybe in terms of the details, we use a thing called logistic regression to do this,
we use it like classifier, which predicted whether or not it had got reward or not from the patterns
of spikes across those neurons. The first thing we had to establish then, of course, is how well
would we do if we just guessed? If we just guessed whether it had got reward or not, we do pretty
well just guessing because obviously there's only two options, reward or not. So we can run some
simulations with the data to work out what's the absolute best we could do if we guessed,
and that is what we could do if we guessed. It's slightly above 50%.
So that's guessing. So how would we actually do, we actually try to take the activity,
the spikes sent by these groups and neurons and work out whether or not it just got reward.
So in that first maze position, we could do phenomenally well. So this blue dot is the average
over all the rats, all the times they went on the maze. It was still up close to about 85% of the
time we could decode whether it had just got reward or not as it trudged back to the start.
Of course, in many of the individual recordings that we had from individual days of running on the
maze, we could perfectly tell you whether it had just got a reward or not just from looking at the
spikes sent by these groups and neurons in its prefrontal cortex. As it trudged back to the
start again, going from maze one, position one, always maze position five, the ability for us
to decode that fell quite dramatically. And it went no better than guessing by time it got back
to the start again. So that meant that yes, we could decode this, but we could also see
that the memory of it fading away, the memory of the reward faded away by the time we got to the
start again. Of course, reward wasn't the only thing that was interesting here.
So that's what happens when we got reward or not. Other things around it that were really useful
for understanding and holding in mind in order to solve the problem of understanding what the
rule was, it had to learn, included whether it had just gone left or right. So if you remember,
the first rule it had to learn was just go to the left, no matter what other things it was
interesting, just go to the left. So it stands to reason then that a useful thing for it to remember
is not only how did it just got a reward or not, to remember whether that was a good choice or not,
but what the choice was then it made. Did I go left or did I go right? So we could do the same
trick, taking those same neurons and the spikes that they sent as it trudged back to the start.
We could ask, can we, from the spikes that they have sent, tell the difference between
whether they had just gone to the left or whether they had just gone to the right? Was it thinking
about the choice it had just made? The answer was yes, absolutely. So again, far above guessing,
the lining gray, at every position in the maze, I said when we got back to the start,
we could tell you whether the animal had, the rat had just gone left or gone right
from the spikes sent by neurons and prefrontal cortex as it was trudging back to the start.
And of course, there was another really silent feature in that maze, which was whether the light
was on or off the arm, because come the second rule it had to learn, it then had to learn
whether to go to the arm where the light was on. So it had to then realize that the light was a
really relevant bit of information. So we asked again, from that same set of neurons in prefrontal
cortex, from the spikes sent by this group of neurons, could we tell whether the light was
on or off at the end of the arm? As in, did the rat even notice, could we tell from the rat's
memory, had he even noticed whether the light was on or off? And what we found then,
do the same tricks, was yes, but only, really, for brief while, just as it turned around and
started walking back again. And then that memory seemed to fade pretty quickly.
So put all together. What we're looking at here then is pretty compelling evidence that
in the prefrontal cortex of these rats, the spikes from these neurons meant things held in
memory. In fact, meant multiple things held in memory for a brief period. It meant both
whether they got reward or not, whether they got their chocolate milk or not,
and they got to the end of the arm, whether they had chosen to go to the left or the right,
and whether the light was on or off at the end. But these memories lasted for different lengths
of time, even though they were sent by spikes from the exact same neurons.
Okay, before we move on, let me recap. So a little tour of cortex. What does a spike mean?
So I've just shown you that, let's start there, in visual cortex, the spikes from neurons in the
first parts of the visual cortex mean edges at a particular position, a particular place
in the world around you. Okay, there are edges in each and in each tiny pixel of the world that
your eyes can see. Up in bryotal cortex, I've just shown you there are neurons whose spikes seem to
stand for the evidence for a decision, in this case, the evidence for a decision of whether
these dots are moving to the left or moving to the right. And then in prefrontal cortex,
we've just shown you that a whole group of neurons sending spike at the same time seem to
stand for multiple different times of memory, multiple memories of multiple things that have
just happened to the animal. And what's good here to notice is that all these neurons are
sending spikes, indeed, there's all same types of neurons in the brain, there's all these
pramble cells in cortex. So these spikes are the common language of the brain, but what they mean
depends on where they are sent and who's sending them. Okay, so that's something of what we know
about spikes in a visual stop tour to convince you that knowing spikes is key to understanding how
the brain does what it does. But there are many, many mysteries of spikes that I promised you,
many things that we don't know about spikes. So in the book, I talk about many of these
key mysteries, which I'll run through now. Right. First, these mysteries is a simple existential
one. It's why do we have spikes at all? Why do neurons send these little blips of voltage to
each other, rather than talking any other way? After all, when these little blips of voltage,
these spikes, at least the end of an axon, they get turned into chemistry, they get turned into
molecules floating across, which get turned into little blips of voltage rather than these
big pulses that get sent to each other. So why do we have spikes at all?
A second mystery then is how many spikes does it take to make a neuron? We know it takes a lot,
but exactly how many depends a huge amount on the details of the neuron that is receiving
the spikes. It's like in the state where it's dendrites, for example.
What is the brain not explode with spikes? So if neurons are sending spikes to each
other constantly, and you have many spikes make one new spike, and that spike gets sent
out to other neurons that were sending it spikes, and the brain is full of feedback loops,
why is it that spikes do not forget more spikes, we get more spikes, we get more spikes,
the whole brain just explodes with spikes? So why do my spikes fail? It passed my
favorite mystery book, other than the one I'm about to tell you about,
that most spikes, despite all this process of sentiment, despite the fact they seem to be
essential for how the brain works, most of them fail to do anything. So there are
papers that show that in the cortex and hippocampus, if you recall from an individual
connection between two neurons, and the neuron that's sending spikes on average 75% of its spikes
will not get to the other side or cause nothing to happen. So only 25% of its spikes will cause
anything to happen at that connection, which is supremely weird. Other mysteries include
how do spikes gain information about time? How do spikes gain information about the order of
events in the world? And then another favorite mystery, how does a brain make its own spikes?
How do spikes appear in the brain if you have some input from the outside world?
But the one I'm going to tell you about in depth tonight, but all the ones that come in the book,
is this one of my favorites called the dark neuron.
So to tell you about the dark neuron problem, I'm going to show you
what it looks like from one of those recordings I was talking about in a prefrontal cortex.
So what I'm going to show you then is a whole bunch of neurons in prefrontal cortex
that are sending their spikes at the same time. So I think a picture about 52 of them
sending at the same time. So what you're going to see is you're going to see lines of vertical
dashes. Each vertical dash is a spike, and the lines you learn be ultimately gray and black.
So each gray line is a neuron sending spikes, each black line is a neuron sending spikes.
Okay, so you can differentiate them by eye. So this is about four seconds of recording
in prefrontal cortex. This is what they look like. Here we go.
There we go. So as you can see, each vertical dash, little tiny dash, is a line, is a spike.
Each line of dashes going across there is the spike sent by one neuron. Okay, let me show you
that again. Four seconds. There we go. Off they go and spike. The reason I'm showing you this
is that if you look at the top, you'll see that there are a handful of neurons that seem to
be sending so many spikes, you can't even see the vertical dashes. They're like solid blocks of
color in this one second. But as you look further and further down, you see that the spikes are
getting more and more infrequent. Indeed, I've ordered it by the average rate of them sending
spikes in this recording. So you get to the bottom, and there are actually neurons there.
You can only see lines. There are no vertical dashes. There are neurons that send no spikes at
all in this window of time we're looking at here. So to illustrate this dark neuron problem to you,
I'm going to build you a little histogram of how active the brain is. So I'm going to start by
doing that by just giving an example of this prefrontal cortex recording here, these 52 neurons.
So what we're going to do, we're going to take each neuron in turn, count how active it is,
and put it on a little histogram. So this neuron here is sending just a few spikes in a very long
period of time. Indeed, if we count the number of spikes it sends per second over a whole half
an hour of recording, it's actually sending less than half a spike per second, as in it sends one
spike every two seconds also. So we put a little dash, let's grab here, put a little cross here,
half a spike per second, and then doing a histogram here. So the y-axis is the count
of the number of neurons that send this many spikes per second. So we're going to put a little
bar there. We've counted one neuron so far that sends less than half a spike per second.
So let's take a second neuron. This neuron, from the same recording prefrontal cortex,
is a lot more active. It sends a lot more spikes in the period of time we're looking at.
So in fact, the number of spikes per second it sends is actually about,
it's actually about two and a half spikes per second. So we're going to make a count then of,
we found now one neuron that makes sense it's spikes about two and a half
times per second. And then let's take another neuron, a far more active neuron, this time,
in fact, so active that its activity is right out here. It sends about 19 spikes every second.
So now we found one neuron that's 19 spikes every second. We're going to add a count of one there.
So so far we've seen three neurons, one that sends half a spike per second,
one that sends it two and a half spikes per second, one sends about 19 spikes per second.
And we're going to then do that same trick for all 52 neurons. We're going to
look at them, each of them, find out how many spikes per second they send and add them as a
count onto here. When we do that, what we end up with looks like this. So what you can see is that
at the far right hand side, we have just a handful of neurons, indeed five that are sending more
than 15 spikes per second, and most of them are sending much less. Indeed, the majority of them
are sending less than one and a half spikes per second or even one the spikes per second.
So this extreme imbalance actually means that 10% of the neurons, these just five up here,
are sending three quarters of all the spikes sent by this entire group of neurons.
Now, to show you that this is common, what I'm going to do is going to show you lots of these
histograms. To do that, I need to do a little trick. So I'm going to turn it on its side
like this, okay? I realize it's already fuzzy. I just want to look at the shape. So on its side,
you can see at the bottom that big, big set of zeros down here, and then go up and see those
little, there's few neurons that are sending lots of spikes. And we're going to plot that same
histogram here. So this is prefrontal cortex population. And on the y-axis here, the y-axis,
we have the number of spikes per second that you have in the histogram. So if I,
and this is that same histogram, but just shown as a symmetrically around the center here. So this
is all those spikes there in that bin. That's this one here. That's all those neurons that are
sending almost nothing at all. Those five neurons there, that's those here at that tail of the
histogram. So now I'm going to show you the same kind of histogram, same kind of distribution of
how active neurons are across a whole bunch of different regions in cortex. So these
not very revealing acronyms. So A1, that's the primary auditory cortex. The first bit of cortex
in your brain receives all the input from your ears. V2 is the second part of visual cortex.
So PFC, that's the prefrontal cortex. OFC is the orbital frontal cortex, the bit of cortex that
sits just behind your eyes. M1 is the primary motor cortex, the bit that seems to be most involved,
particularly our detrusive movement of our limbs and fingers and hands. And then the ones in color,
again, auditory cortex, orbital frontal cortex, and the second part of motor cortex, M2.
Those are going to be histograms of what happens when the animal's doing something. So we're
thinking black is when we're recording from those regions and it's not doing it very much,
it's just actually just sitting or waiting for something to happen. And in red, it's when
they're doing something. So the one in A1 is when it's being played a sound, one orbital
frontal cortex in blue is when it's making a decision, and the one in M2 is when it's moving an arm.
So for all these different brain regions, whether they're doing something or not,
we're going to build these histograms. And they look like this. They all look basically the same.
They all look as though there's only a very, very tiny handful of neurons,
this lot up here, who are sending lots of spikes every second. And most of neurons
are sending one spike per second or less. So most spikes sent by handful of neurons.
So in all these cases, that top 10% of neurons are sending at least three quarters of all the
spikes in those groups of neurons. Or in each of these brain areas, no matter whether they're
sitting quietly or doing something, about three quarters of the spikes are sent by just 10% of
the neurons. So this then is what I'm calling the dark neurons. These are the neurons that
make up the bulk of the population, but send less than a quarter of all the spikes. They're
really sending quite a few spikes. And indeed, it's actually worse than this.
So all these recordings are done by electrodes lowered into the brain.
When we lower electrodes into the brain, the only way we know that those electrodes are recording
from neurons is because those neurons are active. We can't see the neurons. We can just hear them
on the monitor in the lab or see them on the oscilloscope or on the amplifier.
We can see the spikes. We can hear the spikes. So the only way we can record
bosses, neurons that are in the brain using electrodes is because they are spiking. And
that means there's a really fearful bias because it means that we automatically see
active neurons when we record them using electrodes. But if we record them using other methods,
for example, if we call them using a method called patch clamping, which is where we lower
a tiny glass electrode deep into the brain, instead of just having electrodes sitting in
a big metal mesh, we have this tiny glass pipette come down and actually touch a neuron,
physically go to the outside of it and stick to it really strongly.
Then what we can see is much of the time when you connect to a neuron directly,
that neuron isn't sending any spikes at all. Indeed, there are some estimates that when you
do that to a neuron, about half the neurons you're going to attach to will be sending
less than one spike a minute. So in fact, there are probably in the brain, the dark
neurons are the vast majority. The ones that are sending one spike per second or
vastly less down the way to one spike per minute are going to be the bulk of the neurons in
in tickling your cortex. The big mystery here then is what are they for? What are these 90%
of neurons who are doing or more who are doing almost nothing? What are they for? Because after
all, brains are really unjustly expensive. We know that your brain uses up about 20% of your
energy, which means that for an adult human male, you need to eat two miles, miles, miles a day
just to drive your brain. In the book, I go into a number of reasons why
of why the dark neurons may exist. I'm going to talk to you briefly about one now using
what I call the parable of Jenny's teeth. To understand the parable of Jenny's teeth,
we're going to go back to thinking about the visual world again, about the visual system,
the visual cortex, the bit where we're looking at, neurons that like edges. Imagine that you're
a neuron and you like edges like this. This edge is defined by the combination of that black and
white smudge here. That edge is the bit lying between. The black and white is the contrast
that defines that that edge exists. You're a neuron that likes an edge about that thick in
that part of the bit of space you're looking at. Imagine you're surrounded by neurons also
looking at that little bit of space, the same little bit of space in the world, but those neurons,
they like different edges. These two neurons that sit next to you, one of them also likes
that thickness of edge, but it's slightly up and flipped over. The one on top there, this one up
here, what it likes, the ends of things. It doesn't like anything up here. It likes the ends of an
edge and it's in its worldview. Now let's extrapolate that. Imagine you're now surrounded by neurons
like any kind of edge that is, every kind of thickness of edge, every kind of angle of edge,
edges that end in that space, all kinds of rotations and widths. One would have something
looks like this. Around you in this bit of visual cortex is full of neurons like all these different
kinds of edges and they all send their spikes when you see that kind of edge in that pixel
space, in the same pixel space that you're looking at. That brings us neatly to Jenny.
So here is a lovely lady called Jenny. I don't know where this picture came from.
Now you mentioned that the pixel space that you are looking at as your neuron is that little red
square on Jenny's teeth there. Now teeth are quite interesting in terms of their shape. They have
some curves, some lines, interesting texture. A bit where they meet the gum is a little bit curved.
But even with that very interesting combination of features,
they're only a tiny subset of all possible edges are in that space. So only the little,
only the neurons that are showing up with their edge here will be sending any spikes
at all. So across that top row there, there's four neurons that will be sending spikes because
they can see their edge right now in that pixel space, which means that almost all the neurons,
the ones we just looked at, these ones here, almost all those neurons will be sending no
spikes at all because their edge isn't in the bit of space that they're looking at and indeed
won't be for a long time. So perhaps one of the reasons that we see so many dark neurons in the
brain is simply because we don't give them anything interesting to do in the lab, that the only
reason we're going to be able to find them is if we give both really rich tasks that more
reflect the real world to the animal and we're able to record neurons for a very long period of time
for days and weeks and months continuously to be able to pick up what it is that these neurons are
interested in. Right, so let's add the dark neuron problem to all those mysteries and then move on to
the final, the final part that I promised you. So I promised you, I talked a little bit about
why needs to understand spikes is placing a fundamental limit on how well we can understand
the human brain. And indeed, in many respects, the human brain, many aspects of the human brain
are something of a black hole in neuroscience. Because what we struggle to understand in many
aspects of what the human brain does is what the spikes mean in you. Everything I've showed you
so far in that 12 cortex, with animals doing simple tasks, in visual cortex looking at simple
pictures or maybe movies, in plurality cortex looking at dots moving on the screen, in prefrontal
cortex a decision whether to go left or right. And all those kind of simple tasks we can easily
give you. We do indeed give lots of humans images to look at in labs. We give them lots of dots
moving randomly on the screen to look at in labs. We ask humans to choose to go left and go right
or press left and right buttons in labs all the time. And we can be pretty confident that if we
get you to do those same tasks, then there'll be neurons in those same areas of cortex in your
cortex that will be sending the same kinds of spikes, meaning the same kinds of things. That's
because of course, the animals we do the experiments on are mammals. The mammalian brain is pretty
well conserved. These regions all exist in those brains. We would expect the neurons in your brain
to show this similar pattern spikes. But what about human things? So for example, what about language?
About the speech, the generation of this complex grammar that we used and on its feet, the
generation of it, of course, but the understanding of it when we are listening to it. What about
reading and indeed of writing itself? This miraculous process by which these tiny
scratched black marks on a page go here into letters that go here into words that go here
into sentences, here into meaning in our heads of all sorts of our shared concepts that we
transmitted to us simply by looking at scratched black marks on the page. What about maths and
all the other creative sciences? Indeed, maths here, you know, this kind of stereotypical
head-spinning Hollywood nightmare. How is that done by the human brain? What about all the creative
stuff that we do? All the arts, all the music, sculpture, painting, poetry, prose writing,
all of this. Pretty unique to the human brain. Actually, well, it would be complicated social
interactions. So obviously, while there are animals that have really complex social groups,
ours seem to be perhaps among the largest in the natural world. And of course,
what happens in our social interactions is culturally specific, right? We learn over our
lifetime about how the culturally appropriate ways of interacting with people and the various
levels of interaction, both strong or weak interactions that we have with people
over our entire lifetimes. And it's incredibly complicated cultural milieu in which we live.
And then there's the nuclear human stuff about our subjective experiences, about both our
complexity of our emotions and about our moons. And of course, then there's the ultimate sort of
thing there seems to be that it's potentially uniquely human, which is the depths of our
consciousness, okay, the ability not just to be aware, but of course, that we are aware, we are
aware, the sensations of things around us. So these are all these things which are
potentially or genuinely unique to humans. But our ability to understand how the brain generates them
is really limited. So the best way that we have of looking inside the healthy living human brain
is using neuroimaging. So this is an MRI machine with someone on this table about to be loaded into
the brain. And in fMRI, which is a scanning of the live activity in the human brain,
we often see as a result, pictures that look like this. So we see a picture where we have
in gray, a picture of the cortex here, the human cortex showing to the left,
here to the left, sorry, turn to the right rather, to the top and to the left. And we see
last sections of that cortex colored in to indicate where there has been
neural activity during some kind of task. Now, I've already told you that human cortex has in
its 17 billion neurons. That means that each of these colored patches contains hundreds of
millions or billions of neurons. And not only that, but those colored patches are made up of
tens of thousands of tiny cubes. So cubes that are smaller than the pixelated scale of that image.
So that image is a little pixelated inside each of those pixels. These are many, many,
many of these tiny cubes. Indeed, in that image is probably in that colored patch there,
it's going to be 20,000, 30,000, something like that. And each of those
cubes has about 100,000 neurons. And each of those tiny dots of color stands for the
100,000 neurons. And it doesn't stand for the spikes of those 100,000 neurons,
it stands for the amount of extra oxygen-rich blood that's in that region where those 100,000
neurons are. Now, the reason that's interesting is because this is an indicator of the use of energy.
So as we see an extra amount of oxygen-rich blood turning up in a region of the brain,
you think, uh-huh, that bit of the brain needs more energy. It needs the oxygen to burn the ATP
to create energy. So it stands to reason then that when we see this demand for this oxygen-rich
blood in a certain region of cortex, it means that in the cubes where we see it, these cubes
are 100,000 neurons, those 100,000 neurons aren't doing something. They're sending or receiving
more spikes. Because as we talked about earlier, spikes take up a lot of energy.
But that's the best way that we have of seeing inside the human mind. It's oxygen-rich blood
around 100,000 neurons in each of those cubes. 100,000 neurons on a huge scale and not spikes.
What we know, and I've just spent, what, 55 minutes telling you, that spikes is how the
brain does stuff. Spikes are how neurons talk to each other. How they generate meaning of
representation, computation. And that means that we have what I call the explanatory gap problem.
So the explanatory gap, then, is that we have a huge gap between what we can record in the human
brain and what we would like to know about the human brain in an ideal world. An explanatory gap
causes all sorts of problems. It means that we don't know anything at all, literally nothing,
about the spikes happening in your brain when you are producing language, understanding it,
when you're reading, when you're doing maths or science, when you're doing the creative arts,
or any of our subjective experiences, because we cannot record spikes from neurons in a living
human brain. An explanatory gap falls all kinds of strangeness. So speculations about what consciousness
is, which are not rooted in any understanding of how the brain works, because we cannot record the
spikes from a living human brain. So we do not know anything about how the neurons are talking to
each other in terms of the language they speak during any aspects of subjective experience.
We get into lots of difficulties understanding how things of the mind, the domain of psychology,
map onto things of the brain, the domain of neuroscience. For example, we don't know how
attention is things quite obvious to us that we pay attention to stuff. A thing of the mind
maps onto what's happening in the brain of humans, because we cannot record from spikes,
neurons from, from neurons, spikes from neurons in humans.
And in this explanatory gap falls most, most obviously, the kind of speculation that goes
under the title of neurobolic, right, where we put the word neuro in front of any
noun to make it sound more smart and brainy, and though it's informed by neuroscience. So things
like neurocriticism and neuro law and neuro marketing, like as though we knew anything at all
about how the spikes pass between neurons helps you decide which particular brand of fizzy,
brown, soft drink you prefer, or which fast food franchise you're going to order up and
deliver or just eat this evening. We know nothing about that. This fundamental limit,
this fact that we cannot record spikes at all from the living, healthy human brain,
means that there's both these explanatory gap, which is a warning about how we,
well we understand the brain, but also something that is an optimistic thing for the future.
It means that your brain, and it's 87 billion neurons, remains the ultimate challenge for us.
It means that much of how your brain, human brain works is terra incognita.
And we really want to understand the spikes in the human brain, underlying as uniquely human
things. And that will surely drive us on, will drive development of the technology, the technology
we've already developed, not just in fMRI, but how the way we record the neurons in the animal
brain. Drive this development so that one day, perhaps we will be able to record the spikes
from individual neurons in the healthy human brain. And if we can do that, then we can truly know
your life in spikes. So to read all about this, about why spikes are essential to understand
the brain, are the mysteries of spiking, are the limits, or we can know and not know
in my book, Spike. And thank you very much for your time this evening.
