A lot of landlords see themselves as good people.
They are participating in an immensely harmful economic system.
We've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again.
We've got to rediscover a sense of shame
and a sense of direct participation in the harm
that we see around us today.
They seem to think that they're entitled to respect
and I just feel that like the law is on their side,
economics is on their side,
the politicians are on their side,
the courts are on their side.
The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them
and make them feel ashamed is laughable.
Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism
and that's a dangerous place to be in.
Nick Banno, hi.
Welcome to Politics Show.
Thanks so much for having me. Great to be here.
Yeah, well, thank you for coming.
How would you like to introduce yourself?
I am a housing lawyer specialising in legal aid housing work.
I've also got a bit of a background
in more street politics kind of things
and have an interest in a Marxist understanding
of political economy.
Is that the impetus behind this book?
Yeah, I just felt like a lot of the writing we were seeing
about housing used some Marxist concepts a bit loosely
and I wanted to get really under the hood
of the housing crisis and see how it works
from a kind of particularly Marxist perspective.
I think, I mean, I've got to ask you
a really, really broad question.
In broad terms, what do you mean by that?
By a Marxist perspective.
Yeah.
Well, classical economists,
neoclassical economists see the role of economics
as the allocation of scarce resources
and Marx opens capital by saying,
we live in a world that has so much stuff in it.
There is so many commodities in the world.
How is it that everyone is poor?
So he starts from a place of abundance
and he tries to work out what the forces are in the world
that make us live lives of misery and struggle
in a world that produces so much.
And this takes a vaguely similar approach to housing
and it says not only is there so much housing in Britain,
but there's an awful lot of housing wealth
and how is it that when there's all this money
and all these homes,
we live in cities that are packed with gunnels with homes.
How is it that all of us are living in housing poverty
and in very, very bad conditions?
Is that why you've just written for The Guardian
about how we don't need more supply?
Yeah, it really touched a nerve that the supply issue
is really kind of a throwaway line in the book.
I just have this quick justification
of why I'm not talking about supply,
but I feel that supply has dominated the discourse
for so long that people found it really surprising.
A lot of people found it quite upsetting and shocking
that you challenged the accepted wisdom
that you kind of put the property developers to proof
that there is this massive shortage
because that's not really what the stats bear out
if we look at Britain in historical terms
or if we look at the UK in comparative international terms.
But I mean, the short I suppose that accepted wisdom
is because you would think that with more supply
that would I suppose liquidate the market
and make the housing stock more affordable.
Isn't that not true?
Well, that's the thinking.
I think it's difficult to find a great deal
of evidence for that.
If it does work like that,
then the amount of surplus you'd need to build
to have any meaningful impact on price would be staggering.
And given that the planet is dying
and given that there are other ways of doing it,
given that we can regulate a housing market out of crisis,
then it seems to me dangerous to obsess ourselves
with the idea of supply to build a vast surplus
when we don't need to,
when we can just tweak a few legal and economic levers
and get ourselves out of it that way.
Talk to me about regulating the prices down.
Yeah, so in most countries
and most sensible places around the world,
landlords don't have a complete free reign
to work out what they can extract from tenants
without physically killing them.
In most places around the world,
there's some sort of cap or break or regulation
that governs the way in which rental markets work.
And of course, historically, that was the case here too,
but it was completely destroyed
in the late 80s and early 90s.
So we're quite unusual
in not having any form of rent regulation.
And one of the things that lots of us are campaigning for
is to restore it with the hope that that would restore ourselves
to something like a pre-crisis state of affairs.
Because this landmark policy
is going to be introduced in Scotland.
Yes.
But the accepted wisdom of that down here
is that that actually drives up prices.
I don't know if that is the accepted wisdom.
I think it said a lot.
I think it said an awful lot.
And I think it's true that rent controls can be done badly,
but that's not a conceptual problem with rent controls.
If it were the case that rent controls were generally bad,
then they would have been abolished in every country in Europe
when, of course, they tend to be present
in most European countries.
Where there are problems with implementing rent controls,
they can be fixed.
We can make things better.
But the idea that a particular policy
is leading to problems and therefore,
we just need to let the free market run rampant
in Scottish housing is bizarre to me.
I mean, so in layman's terms,
feel free to talk to me like an idiot.
If you're going to set a period of time
in which rents cannot rise,
is that not going to give way to landlords
just pushing up the prices to start with?
It might, but then, of course, that's a short-term pain
for a much longer-term public benefit.
And I also think that all of these guest stories
we hear about rent controls
generally paint a picture of a world
that's a lot better than the one we're currently living in.
Like a lot of these these these healthscapes
I would take over the present housing crisis
that so many people are suffering through.
Right. What about, I mean, is there not a possibility as well
that, I mean, over the last couple of years,
obviously, you know, well, after COVID,
we've seen a sharp rise, a ridiculous rise in rents,
particularly in, you know, in London, in Manchester,
and even actually suburban towns.
But is there not a chance
that rents are going to come down by themselves?
Well, the class of landlords is not known for being generous
and unself-interested.
They're, of course, assisted by letting agents
whose only job it is to tell them,
look, this is what we think the market will tolerate.
This is what you can get out of this property.
So it would be surprising if landlords
acted against their own self-interest by saying,
I'm going to undercut and go below the market rent.
So there's a chain, then, that's driving rents at the moment.
There are structural forces at work.
I think when a landlord buys a rental property,
baked into that sale price is the idea
that the rent will keep on rising.
That's what makes it valuable to them.
So when a landlord says,
I'm not going to put the rent up in line with the market,
I'm going to keep it low,
that signals or contributes to the idea
that it wasn't worth the purchase price in the first place.
It signals or contributes to the idea
that the next landlord who wants to buy it
is not making a very good investment
because, in fact, the rent it's currently generating is lower.
So there's a structural impetus on landlords to raise the rent.
It justifies the purchase price of their product.
It's not just mean people saying,
we want to drive people further into poverty.
So going back to what you were talking about before then,
when you were talking about how supply is not driving,
house prices, I mean, is it landlords?
What is the root cause?
What is driving?
The market's argument is that rents in cities
are what he calls monopoly prices.
So it's the highest price that will be tolerated
under given social circumstances without physically driving
the class of tenants out of existence.
And what landlords have been doing over the past few decades
is realizing and developing their economic power.
And what seems to be happening at the moment
is landlords are realizing that they can just say,
do you know what, there is a fee for viewing.
And they say it and it becomes true.
It's not that there's suddenly a massive structural adjustment
in the number of people or the number of homes.
It's landlords demonstrating the economic power
that they have over us.
They make a demand, they see if we meet it.
And when we do, they say, that is the reality now.
But is that happening all over then?
It's certainly happening in London.
They're charging for viewing or am I sorry,
did I just misinterpret that?
I've heard rumors about charging for viewings.
I've heard rumors about bidding wars.
I've heard rumors about listed rents
not being natural rent you pay.
And of course, the more landlords cotton onto this,
the worse the problem becomes.
Right.
So we're creating our,
we're creating our end demise actually
by giving into them.
We don't really have a choice.
We're not being generous here.
I mean, we really do need places to live.
And if this is the demand that landlords make of us,
we don't really have a choice,
but to say, well, that's what I'll have to do.
Can you talk to me about state backed rent rising
that you talked about, Burke?
So when you have these short life tendencies,
which dominate the private rented sector,
where you have absolutely no security,
landlords are free to demand whatever rent they want.
And when the state says, this is the housing benefit.
And by the way, I'm putting housing benefits up.
What the landlords can do is just generate
that state spending into additional income for themselves.
They can raise the rents in line
with housing benefit rises when there is no cap,
when there is no break.
So you have this system where even the best intentioned
policies of the state,
which are aims to kind of reduce poverty
and to make people's lives easier,
are just converted into higher state spending on landlords,
which of course is a massive problem for the tax bill
and a massive benefit for landlords.
So the taxpayer is subsidizing landlords.
So the tune of billions of pounds,
and it's a number that keeps coming up.
Makes me feel really good that.
Yeah, well, you must be a landlord.
No, I mean, just I'm paying twice.
Well, exactly. Yeah, exactly.
It's the state that's paying.
It's obviously tenants that are paying
and it's employers that are paying,
because obviously wages in this country
have to be sensationally high
just so that people can meet their housing costs.
But also with housing benefit,
a landlord doesn't have to take a tenant
that is on housing benefit.
They can say that certain properties
are exempt for some reason.
Well, in principle, they do
because it tends to be unlawfully discriminatory
to refuse to take housing benefit tenants.
But that tends to take brave and dogged tenants
bringing in legal challenges.
It's not very good at filtering through
into the reality of the world.
And we know that it happens.
We know that it happens a lot.
But what you do have is the sort of base layer
of housing provision in Britain
is met by housing benefit.
That's the state kind of underwriting
the bottom of the housing market
and everything else is built on top of that.
So as and when housing benefit rises
and the lowest rents meet to rise to match those,
the higher up rents rise with it
and it's a tide that seems to be lifting all ships.
So housing benefit is driving high rents?
In part, and obviously I'm not saying the state is bad
and the state should cut housing benefit.
Of course it shouldn't.
But I do think it's interesting to think about the way
in which the state is tearing its hair out
saying, what are we going to do about the housing crisis?
Well, at the same time, just having this open checkbook
and saying for us landlords can demand what they want
and we will just continue to pay.
But what's the simple resolution to that then?
Because I mean, when you talk about supply
or supply not being the answer,
if there was a supply of homes that were owned by the council,
is that not a resolution to the housing benefit crisis?
Absolutely, and of course housing benefit,
housing council tenants are rent capped,
housing tenants are rent controlled,
same with social housing providers.
If we did that in the private rented sector,
of course, state spending on housing would massively go down.
I'm particularly concerned about the housing
that's provided to homeless households,
which are often charged nightly,
which are charged utterly exorbitant rates
and many, many of them are in buildings
that the council had once built as council housing.
So the state's paid for it once
and now it's continuing to pay for it over and over again
in the form of private rents.
So this goes back to Margaret Thatcher?
A lot of it does.
It goes back to Margaret Thatcher and to Tony Blair,
because of course, while it's right to point out
that Thatcher dismantled rent controls,
what kept the landlords in check
for most of the 20th century was that they were scared
that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords,
labor would come and turn it round again.
And when you have a long-term investment like land,
that tended to keep the landlords at bay a bit.
So when Tony Blair said rent controls are never coming back,
I'm keeping what Thatcher has.
That signals to the landlords, you go wild, you go crazy.
So what sort of signal is Keir Starmer
sending to landlords at the moment then?
If we take the premise that perhaps he's,
well, he's utilizing a bit of Blair.
Well, I think he's being curiously quiet.
And I think what's interesting is that he,
I mean, he's been outflanked on the Renters' Rights Bill.
I don't think it's a policy he himself
would have come up with.
And he can't do very much better
than the bill that the Tories originally put forward.
So he's not saying very much about housing,
but what he is is nothing extraordinary,
nothing remarkable compared to what any other politician
is saying.
The Renters' Reform Bill, I mean, it has dominated
the new cycle, partly because it's the only policy
that is actually being put forward
by the Conservatives at the moment.
And a lot of those, the original ideas have been watered down
and they have been relaxed.
But there is one little bit in there about Section 21
that I find really interesting.
And I was just wondering, like,
what's your interpretation of abolishing Section 21?
When I saw the bill, I thought it was surprisingly good.
I think when the Tories were kind of forced
into making this pledge in the 2019 election manifesto,
I think they thought it was quite a technical,
fluffy, family-friendly policy.
I don't think they quite realized that Section 21
is one of the key kind of cornerstones
of the Thatcherite housing settlement.
As I explained a minute ago, it's what allows landlords
to demand a higher rent whenever housing benefit goes up.
So when you abolish Section 21
and introduce that little bit more security,
it becomes that much easier with tenants to say,
actually, I'm not paying this higher rent,
you're gonna have to go through a legal process to raise it.
So it should, it could have the effect of dampening
the kind of runaway pace of rent rises
that we're used to seeing.
I think if it is abolished, it'll take some time to bed in
because, of course, it's been abolished in Scotland.
And Scotland is still,
Scottish tenants are finding their power
and Scottish landlords are realizing the loss of theirs.
But those kind of behavioral changes
can take years if not decades to bed in.
Well, also, I mean, there's a theoretical loss of power
that could be experienced by the landlord.
But we've just spoken about housing benefit a moment ago.
And we said that even though landlords don't take tenants
that have housing benefits,
even though that they are legally required to.
So, I mean, will it actually,
will it give power back to tenants,
do you think, in actual practice?
Because how many young people,
especially in today's market, have the time
or the know-how to take a loan or to courts?
Yeah, and of course, that's gonna be the challenge
that the housing movement faces.
It's going to be re-skilling a generation of renters
as to their rights.
But I do think it's gonna be crucial in terms of
the number of people who don't complain to their landlords
about housing conditions because of section 21.
It suddenly gives them a much safer environment to do that,
to say, you know, I pay you money for this service.
You've got to fix the boiler, you've got to fix the damp.
That's really interesting about not complaining
because it's true, isn't it?
Most tenants don't speak up
because they are worried that they're going to be evicted.
I mean, I think it's true for all of us.
I think we've all experienced it.
And I think one of the really weird and amazing things
about the housing market here is that
if your landlord comes round and says,
oof, there's a bit of a damp problem.
I'm gonna do something about that.
You genuinely don't know whether that's the landlord
behaving themself or the landlord gearing up to evict you.
So even if you have a nice landlord,
you live under such a looming threat that, you know,
it wreaks havoc with people's sense of stability
and their mental health and their capacity to build their lives.
It's a horrible situation.
Landlords don't really do too well
with being told that they have to, you know,
with more regulations being slapped on them.
I mean, a couple of years ago, we were talking about,
actually might have been last year,
we were talking about energy efficiency
and how all properties now had to be energy efficient.
You know, you couldn't have a single glazing or a roof
that, you know, allowed heat to evaporate.
How did that increased regulation go down?
Well, it's, yeah, it wasn't popular
and it's really interesting
because I think a few years ago,
it would have been seen as something of a fringe issue.
But with the massive rise in energy bills,
the energy performance of people's homes
is life-changing financial decisions.
And it's only fair that landlords should,
the ones who benefit from the housing crisis
should be the ones who ensure
that tenants aren't losing money,
not only by paying their rent,
but by paying extortionate energy bills
for leaky flats and poor energy performance.
But of course, if you add on these costs to landlords,
costs that many would argue are actually just, you know,
basic provisions that make somewhere livable,
landlords apparently decide
that they don't want to rent their homes out anymore.
So what's the solution to that?
Well, this is, I mean, I sort of take them at their word
and this is exactly what happened in the previous century
that where it became unprofitable to be a landlord,
they sold up.
And that was generally seemed to be a good thing
because it means more owner occupiers.
It means more ability for local authorities
to buy properties and repurpose them
or redevelop them as council tenancies.
And it just means people,
like more people living in better forms of tenure
than the private rented sector, which is by far the worst.
Do you think that councils would want
to repurchase private property?
We know that they did.
We know that they spent a lot of the 70s and 80s
doing exactly that.
Of course, things are a bit different now,
but I mean, local politicians fall over themselves
to promise more social housing.
And if they were having to,
if landlords were having to sell up
at bargain basement prices,
it's a good opportunity for local authorities.
There's quite an interesting Lib Dem policy
that came out a couple of months ago.
That's something that you don't hear very often,
but that they wanted to sort of devolve planning permission.
So they wanted to give local areas more opportunity
to decide what is in their local area.
Do you think that councils would be able
to purchase private property
and make it into social housing
if local people were able to decide
what those properties were going to be used for?
I mean, to be fair, in the last century,
the way it worked was massive amounts of government grants
and public and public money.
If the government was interested in doing that,
then I think they would probably have to fund it
or at least change the way in which local authorities
can access public loans.
But we know it can be done
if there's a political will for it,
because it happened 50 years ago.
Do you think that there is a political will for it
or will there be understarm?
I know you said that he hasn't spoken much about housing,
but can you imagine it would be quite high up the agenda?
I really hope that things will start to change.
I really hope that we start to remember the old wisdom
that we had throughout the 20th century
in terms of what's called municipalization,
buying property of distressed landlords.
I don't know if it will happen,
but what I think is hopeful is that we're now starting
to remember, to have these conversations again
about how grubby and harmful the business of landlordism is,
about how we have it within our grasp
to take property away from them and repurpose it
if we really want to.
And it encourages me that this is suddenly a hot topic.
This is something we're beginning to talk about again.
I know you'll probably ask this all the time,
but for the sake of the take,
can you explain to me what you mean
by the grubby business of landlords?
I think a lot of landlords see themselves as good people,
and I'm sure they probably are,
but they are participating
in an immensely harmful economic system.
They are profiting from an immensely harmful system.
And the way I think of it is it's a bit like people
who use their phones while they're driving.
Everyone seems to think they have some particular
and unique excuse,
but when you think about it statistically at a social level,
we know that it's immensely dangerous.
And anyone who is a landlord is not just profiting,
they're profiting sort of three times.
They're getting the rental income,
they're getting their mortgage paid off,
and they're getting capital gains.
So even those landlords who think,
well, I could be charging more,
they're doing extraordinarily well,
and they're doing extraordinarily well
to everybody else's loss.
That's really interesting, that phone analogy.
Do you think landlords, well,
landlording, is it rooted in individualism?
It is here, and that's a weird thing about Britain,
is that almost all of our landlords
are just individual people.
I think, again, the old wisdom is worth discovering here,
because throughout the 20th century,
the landlord was this figure of scorn,
this really hated, reviled character,
and there was a massive and deliberate social change
under that trend, under Blair,
to reinvent the landlord,
instead of being this kind of often violent,
always unpalatable character,
to be this sort of state-sanctioned,
petty investor, an acceptable topic for the dinner table.
And I think if we want to be serious
about reversing the housing crisis,
we've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again.
We've got to rediscover a sense of shame,
and a sense of direct participation in the harm
that we see around us today.
I've had jokes before that landlords
used to be hung out of windows.
I'm not... I don't like...
Not physically, sorry, by their feet, just to be clear.
Yeah, well, more often it was landlords doing the violence.
I'm not a fan of kind of chauvinist language around landlords.
I think, you know, it can lead to some nasty things.
I do think they ought to be embarrassed.
I do think they ought to be ridiculed.
It really fascinates me that whenever there is sort of a protest
or a direct action about a landlord,
they seem to think that they're entitled to respect.
And I just feel that, like, the law is on their side,
economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side,
the courts are on their side.
The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them
and make them feel ashamed is laughable.
Why do you think all of those...
Well, all of those that you've just listed,
why are they on the side of landlords?
Well, we're in a dangerous situation where the argument of the book
is that the housing market, more broadly,
is rooted in profitable landlordism.
What generates the vast house prices is the idea that
if you're selling your house, you have to sell it to someone
who may or may not be a landlord.
So anyone buying it would have to at least compete with a landlord
who's able to command these extravagant rents.
So the rented sector is intimately tied in
to the housing market, more broadly.
The government really, really, really can't have the housing market fail
because it's destroyed a system of pensions,
it's destroyed a system of social care,
it's presided over a system of wage restraint
and house prices for an awful lot of people
are the only kind of stability they have,
the only kind of economic well-being they have.
So a direct attack on landlordism is a much broader attack
on the housing economy more broadly.
So it's dangerous territory to be in.
And I think if you don't want to be cynical about it
and simply say, oh, well, the MPs are all landlords
and they're all in each other's pockets,
if you want to be more generous than the interpretation is,
they know that Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism
and that's a dangerous place to be in.
But that's really interesting
because then as the number of renters grow every single year,
you've created a two-tier society there,
you've got an asset class who are able to,
what you're talking about,
social care, adult social care,
they're going to be able to fund that,
they're going to have a pension in that,
then you're going to have an entire cohort of people
who physically can't do it.
Is that not going to be more expensive
for the state in the long term?
Not only can they not do it,
but of course they're paying for the social care
of their landlords and then property owners.
It is something of a zero-sum game
and it's right that the bigger this phenomenon
of landlordism becomes,
the more people the state is going to have to look after.
The irony being, of course,
they dismantled that system in the first place
and replaced it with one of property rights
and it's coming back to bite them.
That feels like the state has gotten larger then.
Well, the housing benefit bill certainly got larger.
What the state is doing with its money
seems to be a lot less.
It seems like so much money is just diverted
straight from taxes to other people's mortgages,
not the people's pockets.
When we look at councils and the number of councils
that are going bankrupt at the moment,
how much of that do you think is linked
to the increased pressures
that they're facing with housing?
Well, the councils themselves
are being incredibly honest about that
and saying we can't afford to house our homeless populations,
we can't afford to meet the temporary accommodation costs
we have and we can't afford to replenish
our social housing stocks.
Housing and social care is obviously one of the biggest
items of local authority spending
and it blows my mind that if we wanted to,
we could just sort that out with rent controls
and we choose not to.
We choose to let local authorities go bust instead.
Just wanna go back to a bit of the theory
that you've got in the book.
So you talk about Karl Marx and Adam Smith
and you link them and you say that both of them
would not like the current housing system that we have.
Can you tell me why?
Well, Marx and Smith both argued
and it's traditionally been true on the right
that landlordism is not a good thing.
It's not a profitable economic activity.
It's a pure drag on social production.
It's taking away wealth that was created by other people.
That was a wisdom that held true for a very long time
and I think we've mentioned in the 1970s
this kind of very relaxed attitude towards the collapse
of the private rented sector.
And it's us who are living in this really weird
political moment where the right supports landlords.
You would think that the right
would be interested in lower state spending
and you would think that they would be interested
in lower wage bills and successful businesses.
Instead, they seem to,
they're very interested in property development, fine.
But that seems to be intimately tied up
with landlordism as well.
So they find themselves coming out to bat for landlords
in the name of property development.
But that carries with it the idea
that the state should carry on spending all this money
on housing benefit, diverting all of this tax
and these wages to the already wealthy.
To make a crass argument off the back of that,
you could say I didn't think that the right
liked benefits grounders.
There you go, exactly.
Which is what you're essentially saying that they are.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That I mean, yes, the entire housing benefit bill
that goes to the private sector is your right,
a form of benefits grounding.
Extraordinary.
We touched on Margaret Thatcher earlier.
Can you tell me how important right to buy was
in creating some of the issues that we have now?
Yeah, I think it's really sad.
I think if I happen to be running a nice local authority
and I wanted to build council housing,
I probably wouldn't bother because we saw this week
the news that this beautiful award winning scheme in Norwich,
an awful lot of it has been sold off under the right to buy
within three years of its life.
And what is the earthly point of investing
massive amount of public resources
in a social generational good
if it's going to disappear and be repurposed
as a sort of private gain within years of its existence.
And you have this idea that the state
is already paid full of this stuff once it's built it.
It's built it as a social good.
And it's now paying for it again
in the form of repurposed right to buy flats
being re-letters, private, often temporary accommodation
at extortionate rates.
So what do you do about that?
Do you get rid of right to buy?
Why would you have never done the scheme in the first place?
I don't think abolishing right to buy
should be remotely controversial.
I don't think it's controversial in Scotland
where it's already happened.
It's a real like fringe demand
to keep right to buy in place or at least it should be.
You know, you should be embarrassed to stand up and say,
I think public assets should be sold off in perpetuity
and let the state pay for them over and over again
in the form of rents.
You see, you don't hear it from that side of it too often
because it's normally a very emotive argument, you know,
that a man has a right to own his own home.
And it's always sold as a sort of like,
it's actually sort of as a bit of a fairytale actually.
What should we change sort of like our whole relationship
with how we view houses and how we view ownership?
Well, I think the idea of selling off right to buy
for emotional reasons is a nice idea if you can afford it.
But I mean, both parties keep telling us
that there isn't a magic money tree.
They can't afford to keep right to buy in place.
Can we talk a little bit about the legislation in Europe?
I love talking about legislation.
What do you know, actually,
they like hearing about legislation.
Talk to me about the sort of things,
sort of regulations in Europe or legislation
that you would be in favor of implementing here.
Yeah, again, it's worth pointing out
just how weird Britain is.
I mean, you go to almost any city in Europe.
They have more or less some form of rent control.
Some are weaker, some are stronger.
The rent controls that exist in Ireland
aren't particularly strong.
The rent controls that exist in Germany are much stronger.
But we're in this very, very weird place
where we don't have any limit
on how much landlords can try to extract from tenants.
So I'm not, for the time being,
I'm not hugely fussed about what we steal,
what we borrow and what we implement here.
As long as we do something,
we can improve it in the future.
But take any system you want and bring it here
or restore the one that we had here
that works so well for the best part of the 20th century.
What would be your, if you had one pick,
one bit of legislation that you could implement tomorrow
that you've imported in from Europe, what would it be?
Well, it has to be some form of rent control.
It is a broad social good.
It makes people's lives less miserable.
It makes people's lives more affordable.
The only people that doesn't benefit is landlords.
And I think we can all agree
that we're comfortable with that.
Would you get rid of landlording if you could?
You know, it's not a case of abolishing it.
You can't pass the Landlord Abolition Act, 2024.
But what you can do...
I don't think you're thinking big enough.
Well, the point is that the state works
in more discreet ways, but it can abolish landlords
and it does abolish landlords.
And that was the really interesting point about the 70s
was that the landlords weren't just declining
and they weren't just dwindling,
but the scale at which they were dwindling was accelerating.
And that was to do with state policy.
That was to do with high interest rates and rent controls,
which meant that it was just simply a bad idea
to be a landlord.
You couldn't make any money doing it.
So you de-incentivise it as an economic activity.
Smith would disagree that it is an economic activity,
but however you do it,
the state, through its policies,
can generate a system in which landlordism fails.
And I think that would be a good thing.
I know you touched upon it earlier,
but do you think there is a way to be an ethical landlord?
No, I think under current circumstances, it's not possible.
Even if you're letting below the market rent,
you're still charging some
of the highest rental prices in Europe.
You could effectively treat yourself as a local authority
and grant a legally secure tenancy.
But I mean, the point I mentioned a moment ago
that even the landlord who comes down to fix the mold,
the tenant doesn't necessarily know.
The tenant would have to take them at their word.
And when the landlord has the absolute right
to evict you for any reason or none,
they can paint themselves as generously as they'd like.
But ultimately, they have immense power over the tenant
and they could choose to wield it or not.
And that's not a healthy situation to be in.
How do we get back to the 70s style of landlording
that you're in favour of without increasing supply?
Well, I think that the 70s style of landlording
was very bad.
I mean, they were awful landlords,
but the point was that they were much fewer often.
Far, far fewer people were being subjected
to the harm of the private rented sector.
It's not difficult to replicate the system of laws
that was in place in the 1970s.
And of course, when you depress land values,
you make it much, much easier for local authorities
to build social housing.
The biggest barrier they face at the moment,
as well as the looming right to buy threat,
is how do we get hold of land and how do we build on it?
Because at the moment, they're competing with Barrett homes,
they're competing with the people
who are destroying elephant and castle lendlies.
And local authorities just don't have the purchasing power.
Whereas if you make that kind of speculative price
increasing redevelopment unprofitable,
suddenly the local authorities the biggest player in town.
I mean, a lot of those big housing companies
that you just spoke about there,
a lot of the time, if you speak to anyone who works high up there,
they actually say their work is very unprofitable.
They say that their margins are very slim.
And I'm sure that's true.
I'm sure that's true.
And it shows just how easy it would be
to drive them out of business if we wanted to.
Looking ahead, I mean, there's been a sharp increase
in the number of millennials who are renting.
But millennials are also expected to be, well,
well, they will be part of the asset class quite soon, actually.
Can you imagine that those millennials,
do you think that they would have been turned off of landlording
from their own experience?
Or do you think that, I don't know,
maybe the human condition doesn't there?
I take your point.
I think that depends an awful lot on the mood music
that we create as a society.
I think part of the way in which landlordism was made acceptable
was by these TV programs
that we're just endlessly on in the 2000s
about playing the property game
and how gentle they made it look,
how acceptable they made it look.
And if we rediscover a sense of revulsion,
if we replace those with TV programs
about just how horrible it feels
when you don't know if the landlord is gonna kick you out
or fix the mold for your own benefit,
I would hope that people take that sense of shame on board
and choose not to.
But fundamentally, I wouldn't like there to be a situation
in which it's the choice of that generation.
I would prefer to create the conditions
in which it isn't profitable for them to be landlords,
in which it makes no sense for them to be landlords
and that they should sell up
either to someone who's going to live in the house themselves
or to someone who's going to do something
more socially productive with it,
like repurpose it as social housing.
It's become quite popular again.
It's not just those early 2000s programs,
but it's popular again on social media.
Yeah, I think it never really went away.
And some of them, they're just really bleak to watch.
I think the original dream of these programs
was that you looked around your dream home
and everyone felt good about it,
but now the host says,
oh, what are you gonna do with it?
And they say, I'll just put a coat of paint on it
and let it out.
And the fact that you can go on TV and say that
without feeling an enormous sense of shame
is a very unhealthy sign.
Yeah, I mean, even on,
I think I was watching something on TikTok just the other day.
It was a girl who must have been about 28.
She was explaining how you could make a home into an HMO.
Yeah, yeah, it's revolting.
And when we had what was called the Rackman scandal
in this country, this scandal of violent thuggery
in the private rented sector,
there was a kind of moment of national shame
around the idea of landlordism.
And one of the biggest landlords at the time
was the church, which sold off an awful lot of its stock
because it didn't like the aesthetic of being a landlord.
So again, these are all things that we have done in the past.
It's well within our grasp to do it again.
People should be ashamed to make TikToks
to say this is how you make an HMO.
Through shame, the church sold it off through shame.
Well, it was embarrassing.
It was also unprofitable,
but for a variety of factors,
the church yet massively decreased its private landlord practice.
How realistic is that ambition going to be
in, well, either of our, well,
near lifetimes?
I think it really is up to us.
I think your right to point out
that the millennial experience is very different
and the generation below us is very different.
And I think there is a culmination of a sense of unfairness and rage
because what the economic purpose that our generation has served
is to take all of our income and pass it on
to already wealthy older people.
And at a certain point,
that the anger at that situation begins to dominate.
At a certain point,
the foolishness of that situation begins to dominate.
And I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that,
you know, as people who are in their thirties become,
you know, the ones who are running the Labour Party
and important in government,
the common sense, there's a sudden outbreak of common sense.
And everyone says, this is a stupid system.
It's plagued me my entire life.
I will not have it plagued the next generation.
So you're hopeful for it?
Yeah, and I think the renters unions are being so good at the moment.
I think housing campaigns are being so good at the moment
and capturing that nascent resistance,
that sense of this is wrong and purposing it towards landlords.
So I think the energy's there and the will is there.
All we need to do is sort of consolidate it,
make sure it's pointed at the right people.
And yeah, I would be very surprised
if we come back here in five years' time and we say,
well, we've just kept the system of landlordism going.
We've done nothing to address it.
I mean, even the Conservative Party is passing a renters reform bill.
Well, there's even quite a strong Conservative group as well.
I think it's priced out, it's called, isn't it?
Yeah, they're not fans of me and I'm not a fan of them.
Oh, no, why? Is it the Marxism?
It's the Marxism.
I mean, what they do is they kind of
confect this debate about yimbs and nimbs.
They say it's all to do with supply.
And if you are not a property development type,
then you want to make the housing crisis worse.
And it's very effective with discourse.
It's very effective at backing people into a corner
and saying, well, I'm a good guy, so I must be a yimby.
And I just think this is a false argument to have.
They've won over a lot of politicians.
They've won over a lot of influential people.
But I think what I would encourage your viewers to do
is to question their logic, question their rhetoric,
question their data, and say, can you really convince me
that there's a supply problem?
Or do we solve the housing crisis
by the methods that were successful in the 20th century
through regulation, through rent controls,
through making landlords in a less profitable activity?
But I mean, is there any hope of anyone
in the Conservative Party introducing more legislation,
more regulation?
You know, it's historically true
that conservatives haven't liked landlords.
As you've pointed out, I don't think it's beyond
the realm of possibility that Tories will say,
that's enough state spending on landlords now.
Let's try and unwind it.
That's the key argument. That's the sell.
I can see that.
Yeah, I think that and wage bills.
But of course, landlordism is so wrapped up
with home ownership that at the moment,
the bigger concern in their mind is keeping
home ownership going.
And they seem to be willing to spend enormous amounts
of public money in the form of housing benefits
to make sure that the home ownership system remains in place.
Thank you very much for coming in.
It's been a real pleasure.
