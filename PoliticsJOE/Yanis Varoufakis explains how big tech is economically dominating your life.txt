Wall Street and Big Tech and the City of London together own your identity.
You have to pay to use your own identity.
If we are going to defeat them, and if we're going to turn this into a viable society,
the global society, we must forget about taxing, we must think in old Marxist terms,
how do we take their crown capital away from them?
This is not a viable system, it's a system we live in.
We are stampeding towards oblivion.
Janis Varivakis, hello, how are you?
Very well.
Good.
I'm very happy to be here.
Very happy to have you here.
Before we get into the subject matter today, your book, Technofeudalism,
I'd invite you to tell the audience who you are, what you do in your own words.
Well, I used to be an academic that no one knew anything about because I was
cocooned in my university office writing esoteric texts that maximum 20 people around
the world cared for, and I didn't mind, until I started feeling in the early 2000s that the
world is heading towards another 1929 discontinuity, let's put it mildly, and at that moment I thought
that I don't have the right, the moral right to carry on playing around with my mathematical
models of game theory, and I started writing fiery articles in books, including the Global
Minotaur, which became quite a significant text, even if I'm saying so myself, regardless of 2008.
It was a time when I was also shifting from Australia to my home country, Greece, which was
always going to be ground zero of the European great financial crisis, and at some point
having opened my mouth once too often and written too many articles about it, a young
man who was leading the Greek opposition at the time, this is now 2010, 11, 12, 13,
at some point invited me to become the finance minister if he were to win, which I did, and
so, you know, from obscure mathematical texts, I was elevated to becoming the finance minister of
the most bankrupt state in Europe, the world. That lasted five, six months because we had
a pact, the prime minister and myself, that we would never accept another bailout loan under
conditions of crashing 80% of the population. He decided that he wanted to surrender. I decided
I'm not going to surrender, and that's it. I resigned and then created my own party,
going from small victory to grand failure, writing books all the time as therapy, so that's when.
Okay, perfect. Let's indulge them in another hour of therapy, talking about this book.
We're going to get into the concepts in it, we're going to go into it in detail, but top line for
people who are just here to begin with, what's it about? Why is it important? Why should people read
it? We all feel in our bones that this crisis is never ending. It is metamorphosizing, taking
different, you know, from a crisis of deflation, falling prices and falling wages, it went to a
crisis of the cost of living crisis, of inflation. We know that there's something dismally wrong
with the world, that, you know, capitalism was always a system that produced crisis,
and new funding forms of poverty and depravity. But what has been happening over the last 15 years,
excuse me, is unique. We haven't experienced that since the 1770s, 1780s. So the universal
sense of angst that everybody shares, including, of course, about the climate. My view is that
the reason why we're experiencing this is not that capitalism is going through another one of its
normal crisis, but rather we are at a turning point, very much like the 1770s, 1780s, when there was a
great transformation, as Karl Polanyi put it, from feudalism to capitalism, and the feudalism power
sprang out of the land. Anybody who owned land, the landed gentry, had power, and it was
all sorts of power packed in one, political power, economic power, cultural power. If you were,
you know, the aristocracy, or part of it, you had it, and you couldn't distinguish between
political and economic power. And the wealth came out of rent, the rents that the aristocrats,
the landed gentry, charged, vassals and peasants and so on. And then there is this great shift from
land to machinery, to capital, and from rent to profit through the commodification of land,
the commodification of labor, even though peasants worked very hard, their labor was not a commodity,
they couldn't quit, they didn't receive a wage, there was no labor market. Similarly for land,
there was no market for land. Either you had it, or you didn't have it. And then everything was
commodified. So that was capitalism. It starts here in this country, and in Amsterdam, around the
end of the 18th century, and it continues to this day. Now, I mentioned before that it was in the
2000s that I was feeling that some major crisis was coming, and 2008, the city of London, Wall Street,
so on, in my estimation, created a rupture in capitalism. It wasn't anything like, not even
like 1929. It was even more substantial than that. And for a number of years, I was trying to think
about what on earth is happening. And I came to the very controversial conclusion, which is this
book, that in the same way that we shifted from feudalism to capitalism, we are now shifting
without realizing it, to a new form of feudalism, a very advanced, almost science fiction form of
feudalism. This is why I call it techno feudalism. But essentially, with a new land, which is the
cloud, and we have new, a new landed gentry, you can call them cloud delists, or you know, the
techno feudal lords, the lords of the cloud, like Jeff Bezos, just one example of Zuckerberg.
And power is shifting from the owners of machinery, of standard machines, even industrial robots, even
advanced machinery, to the owners of this network of machines that creates this digital version of
land. And just one last point to explain to our audience what I mean by that. When you enter Amazon.com,
or Alibaba, or one of those digital platforms, people think that they enter a marketplace,
they do not enter a marketplace, they enter a digital fiefdom, because come to think of it,
even though you buy yourself, it's all mediated by an algorithm that belongs to one person,
who doesn't produce anything, except for this landscape. And how does Bezos make his billions?
If you produce a book, or you know, a bicycle, or anything that you sell through Amazon.com,
he keeps 40%. That's a rent. Suddenly, we've gone from profits to rents, but this time it's not
rents that you charge for the use, or the leasing of land, but the leasing of the cloud. So I call
them cloud rents. And the more I thought about that, the more I convinced myself that this is a
great transformation, which is hugely important, not theoretically, but for me, the idea of the
liberal individual gone. You can no longer be a genuine liberal, or even a libertarian, if I'm
right. Social democracy gone, because what was social democracy? It was a kind of mediation
between industrial capital and organized liberal gone, because industrial capital now is being
exploited by those people. They get 40% of whatever it is that they produce, and no one is going to
negotiate with Jeff Bezos. No one. No government can make any group of workers sit down with Jeff
Bezos, or they can't make Jeff Bezos sit down with any group of workers and carry out a social
democratic bargain or new deal or whatever. And also, if you look at the clash between the United
States and China, why is this happening? Taiwan is not the reason. Taiwan was always a problem.
National security is not the reason. My view is that what you have is two kinds,
two cloud fiefdoms clashing. The American one, based on Silicon Valley and Wall Street,
and the Chinese one. Europe is non-existent, because we don't have a cloud. So anyway,
that's the whole story, really. And we'll drill down their details in the book.
Perfect. And we'll get into those details over the course of this conversation.
Before we do get onto that subject matter, I'd like to loiter around this point about the end of
capitalism, about what's killing capitalism, and whether or not, you mentioned 2008, 2009,
is it fair to say whether actually capital is the force that's causing capitalism to come to an
end at the moment? That's a great irony. We use, look, I'm a Marxist, I'm a left-winger, full
disclosure, folks. And I remain a Marxist. And I think that this is a Marxist analysis.
There's even an appendix with a Marxist political economy take for nerds. If you're a nerd Marxist
and you want to look at what is the actual Marxist political economy behind his book,
there's an appendix. You don't have to read it, but it's there for you to tell people that you
read it. So, you know, I'm saying this because we of the left always imagined that we were brought
to this earth by chance and nature and whatever, in order to overthrow capitalism. That capitalism
will be overthrown by the organized left, by the organized labor unions. Didn't happen. We failed.
We are dismal abysmal failures. No doubt about that, right? All of us. Yep.
So, what did the trick? Capital. Capital went through a historic mutation from a produced
means of production. Because if you think about a fishing rod, a steam engine, an industrial robot,
is something we have produced in order to produce other stuff. It's a produced means of production.
But cloud capital is a produced means of behavior modification. That's very different.
So, effectively, you've taken the, if you remember Mad Men, the wonderful television series and Don
Draper, right? So, you automate Don Draper. You turn him into Alexa. And he does much more than
simply put ideas into your mind as to what you want. Firstly, he trains you to train it,
to train you to train it, to input into your mind preferences. And at the same time, the moment you
have that preference for something, that need for some good, it sells it to you by passing all
markets. In that sense, capital has overthrown capitalism. So, talk about this Amazon Alexa
example a little bit more, because this cloud capital idea is what underpins techno feudalism,
right? How does it differ from traditional capital? You covered it a little bit. And also, how
does it turn us, the user, if you like, into the serfs of feudalism past?
Advertisers have always been in the business of indoctrinating us, right? Of putting ideas,
of manufacturing desires in our soul. This is the major transformation transition
from early capitalism to more advanced monopoly capitalism after the Second World War.
In the 19th century, the capitalism that Adam Smith was talking about was all about, you know,
producing bread and, you know, ale and meat and carriages and horse manure and stuff.
Things that people needed through a market-based mechanism for distributing productive resources.
And using the price mechanism in order to equilibrate demand and supply and all that.
That's before the war. After the war, you've got the big conglomerates in the United States,
primarily, that emerge from the war economy that these huge, immense productive capacity,
they can produce a lot more washing machines that American families wanted. So, they had to
find markets outside and they needed to manufacture desires in our soul for the things that they
could produce because they could produce a lot more than what we needed. So, they had to convince
us that we needed more than we needed. And that's Don Draper. That's advertising, right? But that
was human beings. It was a new profession, the purpose of which was to convince you to buy stuff.
One way street. Don Draper comes up with an idea, wonderful poster on the motorway,
you see it, you say, I want that, then you go and buy it. Okay. Still a very significant change,
back in the 50s, 60s, 70s and so on. Today, what you have is Alexa sitting on your desk,
or Siri on your phone, or Google Assistant, you know, all those contraptions,
which present themselves as your slaves. So, you said, you know, set the alarm clock for
10.35, order milk, tell me a story, play music, stream a video, all those things. So,
it's great. I mean, I'm addicted to those machines. I'm not a Luddite, or a neo-Luddite,
by any stage of the imagination. But that's not what Alexa is. Alexa is an interface
with cloud capital belonging to one man or to a few men, usually men.
And what you do is, you give it information about yourself. So, you train it so that it
knows you. And then it starts giving you recommendations about books to read, pieces
of music to listen to, films to watch, which are spot on. I don't know about you, but when Spotify
recommends music, it's usually music I like. When Amazon recommends books, it's always
books I want to read. It knows me. Yeah, right. Which is very impressive. And we are impressionable
people. So, when Alexa recommends something to me day after day out, that I want, at some point,
when she recommends something else, I will want it, or I will at least buy it. And it will always
be quite close, not exactly what I would have selected without her, or it, but quite close.
So, this is a two-way street. This is an infinite regress. I tell it things so that it can tell
me things, so I can tell it things, and therefore, it acquires a great deal of power over my thinking
and my preferences and my desires and my aspirations even. And the most important thing here is
that it is the same software, the same mechanism, not just software, warehousing and all that,
that can actually send it to me directly by passing any capitalist. The capitalist then
becomes a vessel to that. So, this is what is so different to Don Draper. Don Draper could not
sell you anything himself. He could convince you to go into the shops and buy it. And one final thing,
the reason why this cloud capital in my book and in my mind is very different to very advanced
pieces of technology like rockets or industrial robots, which are also very advanced contraptions.
But the great difference is that capital until now required waged labor to be created. So,
from the steam engines to the industrial robots today, there were workers, there are workers,
in factories, together with machines and other robots and other pieces of produced means of
production that actually build the stuff. So, you need a capitalist who employs labor, machinery,
buildings, electricity, technology and so on to produce the capital, not Amazon.com,
not cloud capital. Most of cloud capital is produced by me and you,
because you know that very well that why can't we compete with Elon Musk's former Twitter X,
even if you and I were great coders and produced such a network, such a piece of software for
short-form debating, which is much better than Twitter, even if we did. Who would join it?
All our followers are on Twitter. X, I can't say it X. So, the capital of X is us and all our
tweets. Amazon.com, every time you buy something or you like something or you upload a review
of some book or some product, you're adding to the capital stock. So, we are creating the, you know,
a large part of cloud capital. So, cloud capital is a new form of capital because of the way it
reproduces itself. It can reproduce itself using self-labor by people who don't even know
themselves, so that's why I call them called us cloud serves, because we do all this work.
Even if we don't do anything, just we have our phone on us and we're walking around London,
Google Maps knows where we are and that enriches its capacity, its cloud capital,
for telling people where it's congested, where they shouldn't go, whether, you know,
this shop is a popular one or less popular one. So, capital that produces and reproduces itself,
that is a major discontinuity in the development of our technologies and the social economic
system we live in. We'll talk about this point in more detail in a moment, I think, because it's
interesting that Shoshana Zuboff in Surveillance Capitalism, she argues that those inputs, those
behavioural activities that the companies then monetise, that it forms part of a new
capitalist system that doesn't go as far as saying feudalism, but maybe we can talk about that in
a moment, but I just wanted to pick you up on, you referred to Alexa as she, instead of it,
and I wonder, maybe you do, maybe you don't, maybe this question goes nowhere, what role
sort of the anthropomorphising these technologies has of turning them into people, of turning
Alexa into a woman, of turning Syria, where you can tell Syria to be whoever you want to be, but
I wonder if you, whether you think that's significant or perhaps you don't, I don't know.
Of course it is significant, the greater the capacity of the machines to present them as humans,
the greater the power of this infinite regress where we're training to train us,
to train it, to train us and so on and so forth. Now you mentioned Zuboff and, you know, an important
book, Surveillance Capitalism, from which I've learnt and which I think is an important part
of the story, but it doesn't go far enough, because it continues to treat those corporations
as monopoly capitalists. Now Henry Ford, Thomas Edison were monopoly capitalists,
they had created network companies, I mean Thomas Edison was the Elon Musk of his era,
think about it, in the early years, the first decade, 1903, 1904, he actually electrocuted
a hapless elephant at Coney Island in order to demonstrate that the electricity, the alternative
current that he used which belonged to Westinghouse, which was coming out of a Westinghouse powerhouse,
was lethal, because he was selling a direct current which would not have killed the elephant or a
human being. So concentrated power, huge egos, new fungal technologies, this is all new,
and the capacity of those people, especially Henry Ford, to monopolize markets through
technological advancement and to create desires into people's minds, desires they didn't know
they had, this is all new, it's there, of course Big Tech has turbocharged it, and it is true that
they have such direct access through Alexa and Siri and so on, and our phones really,
I mean our tablets, to us that that monopoly power, the capacity monopolize a market
is now much greater than it was before the Second World War. However, where I go
further is that I'm making the point that Amazon.com and thousands of such companies now
all over the world, in Indonesia, in Malaysia, especially in Africa, this shift from the market
to digital platforms, these digital platforms are not markets and the, I mean Ford, how did he
make his money? Selling cars, he made the cars and sold them to you. Now the owners of these platforms
of the cloud do not make anything, they are go-betweens, they are essentially renters,
and you might say well why don't we call it rentier capitalism? Well we could, in the same way we could
call capitalism industrial feudalism, it wouldn't be wrong, but it wouldn't allow our minds to
concentrate on the fact that here is a great transformation to another social system which
relies on rents, not on monopoly profits, thus the great difference with Ford, the great difference
with Hilton, the great difference with McDonald's, all those people actually produced goods and
services that they monopolized and convinced you you really needed them. Basis and the rest
do not produce anything, they are creating a new kind of rent which sucks the economic energy
out of the capital sector which is now becoming a vessel to their own cloud-based empire.
I think that's a different story. Let's talk about those technological advancements then.
Specifically which ones you think were integral to cloud capital first emerging and also
where they came from, where are they based, where did these technological advancements start?
They start with the development of algorithms that could actually improve themselves
when I was a student ages ago. Algorithms were dumb, they were like recipes,
you know, you take this ingredient, that ingredient, you mix them together,
then if this happens then you do that, if the other happens then you do something else,
and that's how programs learned how to produce good statistics, solve mathematical problems,
create Excel, these were dumb algorithms. The moment you have reinforced learning
in algorithms, so you have algorithms that do not have set objectives, they have a variety of
objectives that the algorithm can select from. It's a little bit like telling a chef,
prepare a dish of meat lasagna, but the same thing, if in the process you realize that the
quality of the meat is not what it should be, you can have a vegetarian, you can change your
objective, and then going beyond that algorithms that could monitor their own efficiency and could
change, alter their own functioning in order to become more efficient. That's the beginning
of artificial intelligence, and of course now with generative learning and large language
models, you have at some point, this Hegelian dialectical idea, quantitative changes led
to qualitative changes in the same way that when you lose your hair, which hair must you lose
before you declare bold, there is no answer to that, but there is a point when at some point
people say, oh, you're a boldie, right? Speaking from experience. Similarly, at some point,
I can't pinpoint precisely when the development of algorithms and their capacity to improve
themselves and learn from themselves and alter their own substance. At some point,
this was a singularity, not that they became sentient, they never did, and I don't believe
they ever will, but okay, this is science fiction now. At some point, they managed to acquire this
capacity to do that which Cloud Capital does in my book. And I think what's important as well,
and you point out in the book, is that the consequences that technical feudalism isn't
actually inevitable as a result of those technological advancements, that the political
and social conditions were absolutely crucial. Yes. So what are those social and political
conditions? Two. The first one was the privatization of the internet, because internet one, the first
internet that came out of the military industrial complex in the United States, the Pentagon,
when they brought in research scientists from the universities and all sorts of enthusiasts,
coders, to contribute to the creation of the original internet, it was a commons. It had nothing
to do with capitalism. So to this day, when you read a website, you use this HTTP ancient language,
computer language, right? But that's some somebody created that which allows us to read
websites. That person didn't get a penny for it. It was a contribution to the commons,
to the internet commons. Similarly, with the various ancient technologies still used to send
and receive emails, SMTP and so on, you may have seen those. Those were all protocols created by
enthusiasts who were rewarded in a variety of ways, but not monetized. So the first internet,
I remember it, I was using the internet before it was called the internet, it was called Janet.
Did you know that? Joint academic network before it was called the internet. At least in this
country it was called Janet. What were you using it for? Well, initially to exchange data with other
academic researchers. And emails were called batch files, because you would
create a little batch of messages and put them into a file and that file would then be
readable in America by some colleague there. But it was a commons. It was like the commons
before the enclosures. So we had a new enclosures with Big Tech after 2001. And the most important
development there is that they owned and privatized your identity. You cannot prove who you are on
the internet today. You've got to subcontract your identity from large corporations. So a bank
knows who you are, right? So it can vouch on the internet through codes that it shares with Google
or Apple, because how does Apple know that it's you? It asks you to input your data from your
credit card or your debit card. So they take it from the bank. So Wall Street and Big Tech
and the City of London together own your identity. You have to pay to use your own identity.
That's the privatization of not just the commons, but of yourself, of the individual.
To this day, there's no way you can say it's me. Here's proof that it's me. The state could have
done that. The state could have certified who you are and given you a long number, which is you
and your pin number to certify that, but the state doesn't do that. It leaves it to the
private sector, to the conglomerates. So that's one. The second development which created
techno-feudalism that spawned huge quantities and qualities of cloud capital was the response by
our governments and central banks to the 2008 crisis. Because after April 2009,
I don't know if you do remember that there was this meeting here in London presided over by
Gordon Brown of the G7, essentially they decided to refloat finance to bail out the bankers worldwide
and they printed together over 13 years, $35 trillion. And they gave it to the
financiers. At the same time, they practiced austerity here in Britain, in Greece, across the
European Union, in the United States, austerity for the many and socialism for the financiers.
Now, why is this connected to cloud capital? Because when you create all this amount, huge
quantity of money which circulates, sources around the circuits of finance, but people
are there, have no money because of austerity and they can't buy anything. Industrialists,
you know, the captains of industry and so on, you know, take Volkswagen for instance, right,
or General Motors, they look at the little people and say, as if they can afford to buy
something like Google and Tesla. We're not going to invest in it. We're not going to mass produce
goods that these people won't be able to buy. But they have all this money because the central
banks have printed it and given to the financiers. The financiers want to give it to these industrialists.
So the industrialists think Apple has $200 billion, $200 billion of savings. Now, why do they want
money from the central bank if they have savings? They don't. But the central bank picks up the
phone and says, I'm going to give it to you for free. So Apple says, all right, give it to me.
And you know what they do? They go to the stock exchange and buy Apple shares. The share price
goes up. Their bonuses are linked to the share price. They're taking more money. You know,
Mr. Cook and the rest, Steve Jobs before. The only ones who took this money and invested it
were the ones who invested in cloud capital, you know, the Jeff Bezos and so on. There is no doubt
that all the money that has gone into creating the optic fiber cables criss-crossing the oceans,
the server farms, the algorithms, the AI and so on.
Nine out of ten dollars or pounds spent on that came from the huge quantities of money
printed by the central banks, by the states. So the
awful response by our governments to the 2008 disaster
was part and parcel of what created the umph, the funding for the cloud capital that now is
taking over the world. It's interesting, actually. We had Mariano Mazzucato in here recently talking
about the state's role. I'm sure you know the book, The Entrepreneurial State, right? And
the state's role, often in being the first mover for a lot of this stuff, socializing
the risk, accepting the risk of, let's say, creating the technology we needed to put a
man on the moon. But then at the end, it's a private company who reaps the rewards. It's
the private company who takes the profits and the risk is socialized. The profits are privatized.
I wonder what you're reading on the states in quotes, not the United States. I mean,
a nation state's role is in establishing technofutilism and whether or not you view that
relationship between the likes of a musk, a bezos, as a parasitic one that they are sort of
benefiting from the investment that a state has made in the past.
Look, Mariano's thesis is absolutely correct. For decades, the military industrial complex,
the state has been central in investing and guiding the investing and having, you know,
good civil servants. I'll use a term of abuse or phrase that neoliberals used to abuse the state,
picking winners and decided that they're going to build the Internet. The Internet was not,
didn't spontaneously emerge. It was a decision of some people in the Pentagon to create the
Internet for military purposes. But nevertheless, it did not come out of the marketplace.
And then the state comes in and invests. Every technology in your iPhone or your Samsung phone
or whatever was invented as a result of some government grant, which was directed in that Wi-Fi
came out of the CSIRO in Australia. What did the Australian government get for that?
Zero, because it was offered to the commons. Same with GPS. GPS was given for free.
They could have charged for it, but they gave it away for free. And then these companies that
privatize the cloud, privatize the Internet, and that's the Mariano Mazzucato story,
then also privatize the returns and use it in order to exert more power. And to deplete the
capacity of the state to continue doing that, which is like an idiot who sits on a branch
of a tree and starts sewing the branch. That, I think, is more or less the Mariano Mazzucato
story. It's a good one, and I agree with that. But as part of the same story, it comes my story,
because by effectively emptying the state of content, of, you know, deprofessionalizing the
state, shifting everything to the private sector, subcontracting everything to those
conglomerates. The state created a much greater crisis in 2008 that would have happened had the
state not done this. And then the private sector that was supposed to know better,
that's the neoliberal story, right, that the market knows best, collapsed under the weight of its own
stupidity and criminality. That was the case in 2008. And a hapless,
vacuous state, a state that doesn't have the expertise that it once had. This is the problem
we have today, you know. The state does not, why do you think the HS2 is not going to be built?
Because the state doesn't have any civil servants who know how to plan the construction of a major
project anymore. They've subcontracted everything. But still, they are responsible for saving
capitalism for itself in 2008, 2009, under Gordon Branson. So what do they do? They do the only
thing they know how to do, which is to print huge quantities of money and give it to the same people
who destroyed, nearly destroyed capitalism in 2008. And then what do they do? They give it away.
Most people, most companies like Volkswagen and Ford and so on, go and buy back their own shares,
except for some really smart people like Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk and so on, who take the money,
and they are the only ones who invest. And I wouldn't call them parasites, you know.
I mean, I dislike all of them. But the person I consider Elon Musk to be an evil genius,
the emphasis on the genius though, he's absolutely, spectacularly smart in the way that SpaceX,
he beat NASA on its own game. He actually created spaceships that can actually land on their bottom,
without being destroyed. That's not to be scoffed at. So these people
created capital goods, what I call cloud capital, which is wonderful that we have it. I mean,
I'm all in favor of artificial intelligence. When I spent the summer translating this book
using Depot and of course working on top of it, I loved it. I'm addicted to my phone and to Google
and to all those things. No, Facebook, I hate them, but that's my problem. I use Twitter all the
time, even though it's like, who put it that way? I can't remember. You said it magnificently.
It's like taking everything that's written on the walls of many toilets all over the world
and putting it online. But nevertheless, you know, when I want to publicize my book, I use Twitter,
when I want to have a political fight with somebody, have it over Twitter. I'm not saying that they
are useless. I'm not saying that they are parasitical. What I'm saying is that the form of
capital, which is creating a new socioeconomic order, which is not viable. And it's not the fault
of the machinery. It is not the fault of the technologies. It is who owns them. But that is
a Marxist critique of capitalism to begin with. The problem is not the machine. The problem is
who owns the machines and who doesn't have access to them unless they provide free labor,
or very cheap labor in the case of capitalism, free labor in the case of techno feudalism.
Let's talk about that order a little bit more then. We've named the individuals that sort of the
cloud lists the people that could be said to form our new ruling class. Can you talk a little bit
more, I should say, about how their rise and their supremacy then places people like you and me
as serfs in that system, how that dynamic works?
The moment they can create a cloud thief, which attracts us, because let's face it,
if I want to buy a book quickly, which I can't find on bookshop.co.uk, I'll go to Amazon and buy
it, especially if I need to read something quickly. I get it on Kindle. I go to the page,
the relevant page, if I'm writing an op-ed for a newspaper, I do it.
So they create a cloud thief, which you really need and want to be on. Once you're on it,
you are helping without realizing it, reproduce its capital stock, the capital stock that gives
it power over you. So you are a serf without knowing it, a voluntary serf. But of course,
the worst slavery is the one that people volunteer for. Jeff Bezos then
can use the attractiveness of this cloud thief essentially to siphon off the capitalist sector,
most of the profits, because when you chance 40% rent for anything sold on your cloud thief,
then essentially you decimate the profit basis of the capitalist. So the capitalist,
the standard capitalist, the old-fashioned capitalist, becomes a vessel to the
cloud capitalist or cloud-alist, I'll call them cloud-alists for short. We are
cloud serfs to them. In the Amazon warehouse, the people who work there as precarious,
they don't have any rights, really, they're precarious labor, okay, nomad land, watch the
movie if you haven't, you see what I mean. They have electronic devices strapped to their wrist,
which monitor their every move, tell them which part of the warehouse to go to next,
what box to pick up. So they are cloud proles. I mean, if you've seen the wonderful movie,
Modern Times, by Charlie Chaplin, what he depicts there is now full-on through the cloud,
because it's the same cloud capital that connects. Alex on your desktop, your laptop which
creates cloud capital or recreates the cloud capital of Amazon.com. The software that drives
proletarians or precariously employed workers in the warehouse, the drivers who are delivering the
stuff. This is all a new form of mutant capital, which I call cloud capital, which also puts the
lid on the profitability of the capitalist class, which means that because these people never pay
tax, that states will always be impoverished, states will then have to increase VAT, which is the most
aggressive tax. So, you know, it's the plot thickens. It becomes a completely different kind of system.
One could call it rentier capitalism, platform capitalism, but I insist on shifting away from
the word capitalism, because it will help us concentrate our mind on what a gigantic transformation
is, the equivalent of moving from feudalism to capitalism. Do you think we'll ever be able to
tax them effectively? No. Why? Well, because they're too smart and they have better accountants than
the government has, and they can shift from one country to another, and it is impossible
to create the state power or recreate the state power against their own cloudless power
to defeat them legally in terms of accounting, in terms of how they managed to push their
profits from one jurisdiction to the other until it lands in some jurisdiction where no
corporate tax is being levied. If we're going to defeat them, and if we're going to turn this
into a viable society, the global society, we must forget about taxing them. We must think in
old Marxist terms, how do we take their cloud capital away from them, and how do we socialize it?
So it's easier to imagine the end of the private property of cloud capital
than it is to imagine the proper taxation of cloud rents.
Well, come on to that in a moment. We'll talk about viable alternatives. What a more progressive,
call it a utopia future, whatever you like, looks like. However, do you find it compelling to suggest
I sit here in this conversation with you and I go, Janice, you know what? I don't want anything to
do with this. I'm getting rid of my phone. I'm getting rid of my laptop, and I'm going to go
and live in a cabin in the woods and grow my own vegetables. Forget about it. See you later. I don't
want to engage. How do you answer that criticism? How do you try and compel people to not go,
God, this is the power, the wealth of the forces we're up against is so significant
that I just don't have the appetite to try and combat it?
There aren't enough good and hats for all of us to do that. And I don't believe you will do it.
You may claim, you may feel desperate, and you may think that this is a lost cause,
and you may say that, oh, I'm going to do that, but you're not going to do it.
Even if you do it, you know, two months later, you'll come back, you will crawl back into London
using your phone again. To find my way there. You know, an escape to a eucolic
past that never really existed is not the solution.
Is it possible, though, to opt out? Maybe not in the way I've just described,
but you know, you talked earlier about the way these companies co-opt to identities.
Is it possible for us to opt out of that process? Is it possible for us to steal back what belongs
to us? It's like saying, is it possible for somebody who comes from rags to end up with
riches? Yes, it is, yes. But only if it's one person, or a handful of persons.
A handful of persons could rise from rags to riches. They can go from being, you know,
Amazon warehouse workers to being cloudless. No doubt. No doubt. There is this degree of
social mobility. But it is impossible for society to escape as a society from techno feudalism.
You mentioned at the beginning the geopolitics or the conflict, Cold War, whatever you like,
between the United States and China. And that it's wrong to understand that conflict as
a sort of traditional geopolitical game, but instead as a conflict between two
superpower cloud fiefs. So please can you talk about that a little bit more? And I guess I'd
ask you, glibly, as well, who's winning that war? Okay. Before I answer the second part,
let me explain what I mean. The rise of China is an American story in the same way that the
creation of the European Union is an American project. We Europeans like to think that we had
a fantastic idea to end the war in Europe. We had that idea, but the EU would never have been great
without Americans planning and executing the plan for the creation of the EU. Similarly,
the rise of China, okay, thanks to being played an important role by opening up.
But what happened essentially was this. There was a dark deal, I call it in the book,
between the United States as ruling class and the Chinese Communist Party.
Industry would shift from the United States manufacturing to China.
China would be the Chinese capitalists would be exporting to the United States.
They would be getting paid in dollars that the United States would have to print
because the United States was a deficit country, remains a deficit country,
but that deficit would be sustainable. Why? Because all the profit, the dollar profits
or the vast majority of the dollar profits of the Chinese capitalists would go to Wall Street
and be invested in real estate, in shares, in derivatives, and in bonds. In other words,
a large part of the Chinese profits from selling to the United States would be financing the American
government. That's a synergy. They are accomplices. The Chinese Communist Party and the American
capitalists are partners. So why are they now moving apart and threatening the world with Armageddon
with a new Cold War that may end up into a thermonuclear war?
That question was in my mind for a very long time and I didn't have an answer to it until
I noticed WeChat. WeChat is an application that belongs to Tencent,
a conglomerate, a big tech megalith in China. I realized that the West doesn't have anything like
that. Imagine if there was an app, and by the way that's what Elon Musk wants to do when he calls
and everything up. That's WeChat. Imagine there is an app that allows you to send messages,
watch TikTok-like videos, watch movies, listen to music, everything that's Spotify,
Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, and so on. Do everything in one app plus
three payments. You don't have that now here. You need to download the application of Lloyd's Bank
of Barclays Bank of Bank of America and so on. They charge you an arm and a leg to make payments
or they charge proprietors, shops, shopkeepers, an arm and a leg, Apple pay, they charge huge rents
for making these transactions. WeChat, three payments and you can have any WeChat app.
All you need is a bank account somewhere in China, in one. So suddenly this amazing deal
that the United States had with China, but also with the European Union, a little aside,
when the euro came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is great because we Europeans will be able
to compete with the dollar, the exorbitant privilege of the dollar, the supremacy of the
dollar is going to be challenged by the euro. That never happened and never will happen. Why?
Because if you're a German industrialist, if you, you know, Mercedes Benz or a Dutch industrialist,
you don't want the euro to usurp the power of the dollar because your money, most of your
profits come from selling to the Americans. Now, the Americans are a deficit country.
The only reason why you sell to them is because they have the state deficit,
which they cover with dollars. And the only reason why you accept dollars because of them,
the exorbitant privilege of the dollar. So you don't want the euro to undermine the power of
the dollar as a European capitalist, right? That's the greatest strength of the American dollar
is foreign capitalists, not the CIA, not the American military, not Biden, none of these people.
It is a foreign capitalist who freak out at the thought that the dollar will lose its
authority and power. That applies to the Chinese capitalists who do not want to see the one,
the Chinese currency, overtake the American one. But the Chinese, because they have,
due to the power of the Chinese Communist Party, fused their big tech with their big banks,
something that's not happening in the United States. Wall Street will never allow Silicon Valley to
go anywhere near the payment system. So they are at loggerheads, Big Tech and Silicon Valley.
Sorry, Silicon Valley and Wall Street. In China, they refuse their one thing. That's why you have
WeChat. Add to that the central bank digital currency, which allows you and me,
followers as well, to have a digital wallet in China with three transactions, in one, of course.
Right? Suddenly, the predominance of the dollar comes into question.
The Trump administration started the Cold War by freezing Huawei out. In my estimation,
it's because of that. Nothing to do with Huawei posing a national security threat or anything
like that. And then you have the war in Ukraine. And the confiscation of $400 billion, owned by
the Russian Central Bank, by the West, primarily the United States. I'm not going to start a
conversation about whether they should have done that or not. All I'm saying is that if you are a
Saudi Arabian prince, an Indonesian oligarch, and of course a Russian, but even a Ukrainian oligarch,
you never know what happens after the war. And you see that these Americans have no qualm
confiscating your money, hundreds of billions of dollars. Then you think twice before you put
all your money in dollars. So this super-high way of payments, of free payments that the Chinese
have created, which they didn't even want to use themselves, because they want the American dollar
because their capitalist profits come from the American. Suddenly, it sees a lot of traffic.
And Wall Street, they are shitting their pants. Excuse my French. It's welcome,
because they think, oh my God, here we have an alternative to the dollar system. I think this
is what's underpinning the New Cold War. When Biden announced that essentially what he told the
Chinese in the fall of 2021 was, we will prevent you from becoming in a technological advanced
country. When you ban the sale of advanced chips, chips to a country like China, you're saying,
you will stay technologically backwards. Well, that's a declaration of war.
A technological war, but economic war. So they start decoupling themselves, and they start
putting more emphasis on this alternative payment system. So it's a clash of two cloud thieves,
two cloud technofedalisms, a clash between two payment systems, both of them digital,
both of them living on the cloud, one dollar denominated, the other one denominated. And where
is Britain? Where is the European Union? Nowhere. We are utterly insignificant.
It's a reassuring place to be, isn't it? I don't mind being insignificant. It's just that our
politicians have not gotten onto that. What's actually happening? Yeah, they keep thinking up
making Britain great again, the European Union that is going to become a significant force.
If we integrate more and we have more countries in the Balkans and Ukraine and so on, rubbish.
We are nobodies. It is China on the one hand with the coalescence of the bricks around it,
and the United States on the other hand. That's a very unstable world to live in,
and doesn't augur very well for the European continent, including Britain.
Could you talk a little bit about how cryptocurrency fits into that network? Because I assume on the
one hand, this possibly democratized, direct, discrete system for financial transactions
essentially threatens the stability and the supremacy of those two payment systems you just
mentioned. I think that crypto is overblown. It's macroeconomically and sociologically
insignificant. It is technically fascinating when the algorithm for Bitcoin came out
by Nakamoto in 2008. I spent quite a few months studying it. I was fascinated by the
technology and why the magazine interviewed me back then. What did I think of it? And I said,
it's a fantastic solution to a problem we have not discovered yet. It's of money,
and it can never be money. And I explained in the book why it can never be money.
It can be a speculative asset, which is what it is. I mean, nobody uses Bitcoin to buy stuff,
and it would be crazy to use it to buy stuff if you think about it. Because imagine that,
to begin with, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It has to have a fixed supply in order to have value.
But at the moment, lots of people use it to buy things, and more people come in, demand for
Bitcoin increases. So it's dollar value or pound value rises. At some point, when it exceeds a
certain point, if it starts working as a function, as a currency, then people are better off using
Pounds again and keeping holding their Bitcoin. So there is a plateau. There is an inbuilt
ceiling, which does not prevent Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency from functioning like a
means of exchange. So then it becomes a speculative thing. And then you have an oligarchy of those
early adopters who are sitting on very valuable piles, stashes of Bitcoins. So
I don't find it interesting. I find the blockchain technology very interesting. And in my previous
book, Another Now, which was a political science fiction novel, where I imagine Another Now,
how could things have developed today in a socialist world after 2008? How would things
work? Blockchain is part of the deal. But it is not a way out of capitalism or techno feudalism,
is a technology that we will use once we are free of the yoke of capital.
You addressed the book to your father, who hoped that a capitalist order would be replaced by a
socialist utopia for the benefit of society. And one of the striking things, I wanted to
ask you, you are almost interviewing yourself about Another Now, because obviously one of
the things in socialism is that there are very few blueprints out there about what the future
society could look like. And that is provided in Another Now. You have just literally described
it as science fiction. So I don't know how valid it is as a comparison to techno feudalism and as
an alternative. But you mentioned democratised company and democratised money. And I wonder if
you do think those are viable alternatives to the reality that you are describing in this book?
Yeah, the only viable models. Because What We Have Now is not viable. It is real. But it is not
sustainable. The economic crisis we are facing and which we will continue to face have to do with
the fact that value is created in a tiny sector of the economy, which is shrinking the capitalist
sector of the economy. That's where value is produced by wage labour. But that is shrinking.
We have an increasing domain of free labour, of cloud service, of cloud capital, of the platforms,
which are parasitic to a shrinking capitalist base. So our crisis, financial crisis, economic
crisis, cost of living crisis are going to be getting worse and worse and worse. Just like the
climate crisis. So this is not a viable system. It's a system we live in. But we are stampeding
towards oblivion both socially and environmentally. So the reason why I wrote Another Now, by the way
science fiction is not about any fairy stuff. Science fiction is not about the future. Science
fiction is an innovative way of writing about the past and the present. That's why I always love
the science fiction. So as a socialist and a politician, I always have to answer the guy in
the pub or the lass in the pub who says to me, okay, mate, if you don't like the way things are,
how should they be? And that's a difficult question. And I didn't have an answer to that. That's why
I sat down and wrote that novel, which was about, you know, if our revolution, Occupy, Wall Street
and so on had succeeded in 2008, what could life be like now, given the technologies we have?
And, you know, the fallen nature of humanity that is a given, right? We are imperfect beings.
So I try to imagine what would corporate law be like. So I advocate the idea of one worker,
one employee, one share, one vote, which if you think about it, it's such an easy idea in the same
way you have one vote. When you go to the polling stations, you have one vote as a worker, and you
cannot buy votes, you cannot lease votes, you cannot rent them in the same way you can't in the
political system. So imagine that. Suddenly, without revolution, without having, you know,
without storming the Buckingham Palace or the Winter Palace or whatever, suddenly you have
totally democratized the world of work, and you have done away with the stock exchanges,
because if you can't sell and buy shares, then what's the point of the stock exchange?
And if you have the central bank, the Bank of England, let's say, or the European Central Bank,
giving each one of us a free digital wallet with a pin number where we can park our money,
then what's the point of having an account with Lloyds, Barclays? You don't even need to be
authoritarian and ban them. They would just shrivel and die unless they can provide you with services
that they're not providing you now. I mean, the only reason why you now have an account with a
private banker is because it's the only way of using your money. So another now was all about
being practical in a science fiction kind of way, in answering the question, how could things be
functioning today? Do you think we can get that? Well, I don't think I'm going to live to see it,
if that's what you're asking. Mind you, I'm getting old anyway, so that doesn't matter.
So this is the bad news. The bad news is that I'm not optimistic, but I think that to be
optimistic today, you have to be a real fool given that there's no empirical evidence pointing to
good outcomes. But then again, imagine this being the 1770s. And I mentioned the 1770s because that
was the time when Adam Smith was writing his Wealth of Nations, which spearheaded, spearheaded,
introduced the world to the great transformation of the time from feudalism to capitalism.
If I'm right that today we're living the same moment of transformation from
capitalism to feudalism, I think the 1770s is a good point in time to compare ourselves with.
So imagine this was the 1770s and I was advocating a world without slavery. And you were
interviewing me and you said, do you think this is going to happen? I probably would say to you,
no. I can't imagine, you know, there had been no human society without slavery beforehand.
So how could the human mind in the 1770s imagine a world where slavery was
universally condemned and bound? So on the one hand, totally pessimistic. On the other hand,
absolutely hopeful. Good.
Mr. Farkees, thank you so much for coming in. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
