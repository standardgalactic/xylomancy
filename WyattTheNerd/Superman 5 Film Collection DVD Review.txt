Today, I'll be reviewing Superman 5-Film Co. Lookin' In.
It's the good thing I made Superman shirts on that have 3D glasses with no lenses.
And I have a jacket just to do it.
And I also look super nerdy in these glasses, which I'm like a movie nerd or a video game nerd.
I don't know.
There you go.
Take this off.
Let's begin.
The video is what I just said.
I'll be reviewing the DVD of Superman 5-Film Collection.
I was gonna do an unboxing actually on this DVD, which is after I messed up.
Which I think it was like November 2nd when I did it.
Or like when I got it.
I think.
I just think.
Anyway, here's the Superman 5-Film Collection.
This is actually very awesome.
Because it has Superman, the movie, expanded edition.
Superman 2, the Richard Darver cut.
Superman 3 and that's, I think that's like a sort of a good movie.
When I see it like, I mean like the bun is pretty weird.
I mean it's like a comedy and Superman the movie and Superman 2 have never really been a comedy, I think.
Superman 4, The Quest for Peace, which I saw yesterday and I didn't do a review on it.
But I was gonna do a review later on it.
Probably like on a white dinner special.
And it was really horrible.
Superman returns out here.
People are saying it was boring.
I think it was trying to be like Batman begins.
So yeah, here's like the cover.
Here's like what it says on the back.
I don't know if you can read it or not.
It's sort of two new heights with the DVD, 5-Film, superhero DVD collection, movie collection on me.
Superman the movie, expanded edition.
So here's the expanded edition.
It says, a box office smash in Academy Award winner and a fan favorite since it first flew into theater.
Superman the movie is a symbol of cast and creative.
I don't know how to say this.
I think in one of my early videos I kept reading stuff and I didn't even know how to say it.
But anyways, it's only a big movie can as it's hard for three sequels.
It is Christopher Reeves intelligent.
I don't know how to say this word too.
And portrayal of the most human man of steel commentary, I mean by director Richard Donner and creative.
I don't know how to say this word too.
I don't even know how to say it.
I want to read stuff.
I don't even know how to say it.
I'm just going to skip it and see what else it says.
Music only out of your track.
And so Superman 2 to Richard Donner cut.
This is not actually the real Superman 2.
It's like, I think with the director of this movie take out some parts and make it way better.
And I'll turn it.
Version of the original 1980's theatrical release on Wooden Gling.
Released from Phantom Zone.
Imprisonment.
Three superpowered planet cryptons.
Criminals.
Planet and Slave Earth.
Just when Superman, Christopher Reeves, decides to show a more romantic to, I mean, besides Loose Lane, Margaret Kidder.
Gene Hathman also returns as Solicitor.
Introductioned by director Richard Donner.
Commentary by Richard Donner.
I don't know how to say it.
It's the last name too.
And Superman 2.
Restoring the Vision.
Hot Future.
I don't know.
I'll say that.
And deleted scenes.
So part of deleted scenes are like the cut scenes of the Richard Donner cut.
But those are like the two good movies in here actually.
The rest of the movies in here, I heard people saying that they're real good or boring.
Superman 3.
Which is this one.
This one's the one that I'm talking about.
That's like a comedy.
This is probably like the most comedy one.
Meet Gesa Gorman.
Richard Pryor.
A native computer programming natural for him.
A keyboard as a weapon.
And as a result, Superman faces the, I don't know how to say that too.
I'll say these words.
I don't even know how to say it.
I don't know.
Myths of his life.
Christopher Reeve reprises his signature role.
The pinning.
His character is human side as a car kid.
Commentary by Ella Salkine and Pierre Spinger.
The making of Superman 3.
1983 TV special.
That's probably going to be a good special scene.
Additional scenes in Dear Ankle.
I don't know how to say that.
I'll just say trailer.
Superman 4 to Quest for Peace.
This is probably the worst Superman movie in this whole collection.
I watched this movie yesterday and it's super bad.
I mean like really bad.
Superman 4 to Quest for Peace.
Which is this.
Which has nuclear man in it.
It's very silly.
To make the world safe for nuclear arms.
And merchants.
Lex Lister Jean and Hackman.
Creates a new beat.
The challenge demand of steel.
The radiation charged nuclear man.
Mark Pillow the two folks.
Clash in his explosive extra.
I don't know how to say that.
Commentary by co-screenwriter Mark Rosenthal.
I think.
And additional scenes in trailer.
Now Superman Returns.
Which is the last one.
People say this one is boring.
I haven't seen this one yet.
Which is a new one.
Following a mysterious events.
Which I think.
Several years the man still comes back to Earth.
In an epic action of inter Superman Return.
In an attempt to protect the world.
He loves from.
I don't know how to say.
From destruction.
Superman branded Ralph.
He marks on an epic journey of redemption.
That takes him from the depths.
Of the ocean.
From far.
Of our space.
So yeah.
We're all done.
Now Superman Returns.
Which I don't know.
But oh yeah I did show you.
The picture of it.
Yeah this is like the DVD of it.
And this is what all the discs look like.
So here Superman.
The movie expanded edition.
And Superman 2.
The Richard Donner Cook.
Superman 3.
Superman 4.
And Superman Returns.
All these DVDs look super duper cool.
It's like very cool that you have them.
In like one DVD.
I mean like in one DVD box.
This is very cool.
I have Star Wars.
Like the whole Star Wars Zaga.
And it was like 100 bucks.
And this was only $15.
So it's for a good price at Walmart.
This is like really good.
I just love this.
You have to buy this.
If you're a Superman fan.
You have to buy this.
It tells the whole story of Superman.
Like the man of steel.
And it doesn't have the man of steel in here.
It has just one story going down.
So Superman the movie expanded edition.
It's like part one.
Superman 2.
The Richard Donner Cut is like part two.
Superman 3 is like part three.
And Superman 4 the quest for peace.
It's like part four.
And Superman returns like part five.
So yeah.
All these is like the Star Wars Zaga.
And yeah.
You have to buy this.
If you're a big Superman fan.
And yeah.
It's very cheap.
If you go to Walmart.
If you find it.
So yeah.
Don't forget to subscribe.
And leave a like.
And I gotta do my special thing again.
My car can't think.
Superman.
And to zip my jacket up.
And um.
And cause.
Take it a long time.
And bye.
