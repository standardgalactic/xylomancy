okay your book let's go on a journey of the mind this was such an incredible book this book really
it felt like i was reading something that i've been having these intuitions for quite some time
and it felt like i was reading my own thoughts at some point um before we start i think it's
always important when we go into a conversation like this the listeners need to have a shared
understanding of what we're discussing so i think definitions play a huge role in this regard let's
define consciousness the self and the mind all right well let me uh start with the mind actually
let me even step back even further to say i'm going to be sharing ideas about consciousness
and the mind that i suspect most of your listeners have never heard before i am my fellow co-author
who i wrote journey of the mind with we have a different background than most people who study
consciousness a mathematical background we have always approached these problems from a mathematical
perspective and even more than that as i'll describe in a few minutes i've had other sources
of ideas and math about all of this as well so it's going to sound different but i'm going to do
my best to explain everything in clear simple terms so that anybody can follow along so you asked for
some definitions let's start with the mind because getting a basic understanding of the mind is
critical if you want to understand the deep mysteries like consciousness self-consciousness language
and other things even higher above consciousness and self-consciousness and so here's the most important
thing to understand about the mind the mind is activity the word mind is an action noun like dance or game
or combat everything that we experience when everything that we think about or feel is activity activity
in the mind if you want to understand the mind if you want to understand things like consciousness
language self-awareness emotion how do we feel how do we feel love that if we want to understand these things
then you must think about the mind in terms of activity this is perhaps the greatest fallacy the greatest
pitfall for all people but including scientists is mistaking things for activities chemists used to think
that combustion was a liquid called phlogiston uh physicists used to think that heat was a substance
also a liquid uh called caloric uh biologists thought that life was a substance called elan vital a thing in
each of these cases our natural intuition makes us expect a thing but when we look at it we find out each of
these are collective dynamics collective dynamics of molecules in the cases of combustion and heat
collective activity of cells in the case of life and in consciousness it is the collective activity of all of
our neurons and modules and we'll describe that exact activity but this has been the number one uh fallacy which
trips up so many people they go looking for that thing that magic neuron that magic energy that magic
is a substance uh some people even go so far to say it's a hard problem that can't possibly uh be solved
that's baloney that's silly that's that's a cowardly unscientific uh approach uh from the 20th century
nobody should be talking about the hard problem anymore we're way past the hard problem the physical
dynamics of consciousness were already figured out before the hard problem was even proposed in 1982
steven grossberg first identified the physical dynamic of consciousness and he and now us have
been building on that ever since there never should have been a distraction like the hard problem that
was a very long introduction and probably more than you wanted no no very important to set up this
perspective i would call my view of the mind the dynamic mind viewing the mind as dynamics as activity
nail down the activity in the mind and you will understand the way of mind i'm i'm scheduled to chat to
steven at some point because we we were exchanging emails and we're about to we're going to chat about
this i think it's the perfect time then let's go into his his work and how it paved the way for your
work for you inside steven grossberg is the greatest living scientist and he is certainly in the running
to be considered one of the greatest scientists of all time why would i make such a seemingly outrageous
claim how could somebody that most people have never even heard of how am i calling him the greatest
scientist alive right now with full confidence here's why isaac newton opened up modern science
opened up modern physics by trying to figure out the dynamics of matter the dynamics of motion
and he threw out everything that was known everything that was believed about physical reality and took
physical motion on its own terms he did his own experiments wrote his own equations he figured it out
from scratch without any preconceived notions he figured out the dynamics of motion on its own terms
figured it out that started science that started physics wonderful brilliant work steve grossberg did
the same thing with the mind the big problem is oh the big challenge in mind science has always been
one simple question what is the right math to understand the mind what is the right math for thinking
and everybody first for half of the 20th century nobody even cared about the math freud no math behaviorism
they had a little math but they didn't want math for thoughts they didn't want math for anything
inside the mind so they didn't care about it either cognitive science the gnome chompsky and steven pinker crowd
still no math they just have simplified abstractions black boxes this goes to here to here to here
algorithmic a little bit but not math still no math finally 21st century we finally get mathematical
models of the mind there are three three major mathematical models of the mind the least known
one the most obscure one is ours dynamic mind associated with steven grossberg we'll get back to
him in a moment what are the challengers the statistical mind some people think the mind is a bayesian
machine that is calculating probabilities and statistics the reason this ridiculous idea has
maintained itself and become so popular is because of the astounding success of artificial intelligence
which is based on statistical math deep learning kinds of algorithms these chatbot algorithms these
are all statistical algorithms very effective for what they do but the brain is nothing like that
because the brain is not a thing statistics looks at things the brain is not a thing the other view of the
mind we might call the digital mind or perhaps an information processing mind the idea that the mind is an
information processing system usually technically this is the idea that the mind follows the rules
and properties of information theory system devised by claude shannon but all the assumptions to apply
information theory they do not apply to the brain the brain is not an information processing system it is not
processing digital inputs it's not uh operating the way a shannon kind of information system is these are
distractions these are math forms of mathematics that were developed long ago for other subjects
so unlike what isaac with isaac newton did these scientists instead of trying to figure out how the
brain the math for the brain just adopted math from other things why in the world would the math for astronomy which is what
statistics came from or the mass math of information systems which is what from logic uh you know from
a hundred years ago why would that have anything to do with this incredibly complicated neural architecture
of the brain it doesn't so what steven grossberg did why he is the greatest living scientist is he
threw all of that out and at the age of 17 he sat down like newton and from scratch said what is the right
math for understanding the mind and he's calculated he figured it out as a 17 year old he figured out
the dynamics for the most complicated and sophisticated module uh in the brain what one of the second most
sophisticated module in the brain the where module which takes a sequence of inputs and creates a
single representation of a sequence of inputs like a phone number or a grocery list that sort of thing this
is a very this is one of the most challenging modules in the mind to understand mathematically
and he figured it out as a 17 year old and ever since then he's been building on this piece by piece
trying to figure out the right math for everything in the mind for every function from a visual recognition
to audio tracking to smelling to planning to free will every part of the mind at every level he has put
math to an integrated system of dynamic dynamic system of math that accounts for almost everything
in the brain including consciousness it's incredible i can see the excitement when you talk about his work
and you obviously draw a lot from it when you talk about these three laws of consciousness let's let's
get into it and i think let's also discuss because it's it's obvious that you have people like
carl frist and you've got a lot of other thinkers now with hierarchical bayesian brain theories
computational theories of the mind why do you think it's growing as much as it is in that
regard and thereafter i think let's move into the dynamics of this of the mathematics behind your
theory of consciousness again i think bayesian theories are popular because the math is so
worked out it's so familiar people get trained in that and it's you're given a hammer you look for nails
is the thing that this is the problem this is why mind science has always lagged behind the physical
sciences and why it's such a challenge is you gotta learn math that you've never heard of before
that you're not familiar because it's not the math of the physical world it's the math of mind and
thinking it's not just a reflection of the stars or you know orbiting the center of the galaxy it's
nothing like that it's wholly different dynamics wholly different math it's very hard if you haven't
done it before it's very challenging it's more challenging than learning quantum physics and
relativity those are easy compared to the math that steven grossberg has shared with us for the mind
but bayesian math is very easy and it's very familiar and you'll there's huge communities of
people that you can talk about with and that will understand it i understand it you know but it's not
describing the brain look here's how you know in science if you're all on the right track it's very
easy you start to find integrations isaac newton had the first integration in science he integrated
the dynamics of earth with the dynamics of heaven everybody thought this physics in heaven was
different than the physics of earth he showed no gravity is the same everywhere the dynamics of the
motion are the same everywhere heaven and earth then physics just had a jamboree a celebration of
integrations electric electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism electromagnetism and the weak
force to electrowe just endless endless integrations meanwhile my field mind science nothing no integrations
whatsoever reinventing the wheel every decade year after year let's start again let's start again when
did the integrations happen steven grossberg rolled with the integrations oh my god integration after
integration uh he showed that the processing of surfaces is integrated with the process of boundaries
in our visual system he showed how our system to recognize an object to recognize a visual object
it's integrated with the process of figuring out where that object is and vice versa to know where an
object is you need to figure out what that object is he has done dozens if not more integrations of
all kinds in the mind things that seem separate that seem like different parts of the brain that didn't
really have anything to do with each other he showed how math can combine them he has had a storm of
integrations that rivals what has happened in physics so sticking to that theme i mean we
discussed these bayesian brains we've discussed computers what about the other theories of
consciousness we've got global workspace theory neuronal theories of consciousness like integrated
information theory i think yours sort of falls along the lines of a global workspace theory and then
obviously branches out considering that that's focused i i i know this is a bit uncouth and impolite
i'm not in academia so look it's like einstein worked out the theory of relativity and there's people
that show up and say you know what i think time might not be absolute i think time might change
and then you know i says like well you know i have the theory of relativity yes time does change and
they're like well we're gonna figure it out on our own all right you know these are much much simpler
and limited there's no integrations if which space theory was the answer you should see it connecting
with all kinds of stuff it should language should fall out of it self-awareness should fall out of it
free will should fall of it naturally which is what happens with grossberg's explanation of consciousness
once you understand the math work everything starts to tie together we're thinking about this as
trying to unify everything into one so sort of getting a general explanation for everything with
one solid theory of consciousness with his theory of consciousness you talk about the three laws
do you want to run through them let me let me interrupt you let me interrupt you i'm going to blow
your mind now okay and and make this show uh uh well very memorable so i need to share a couple things
about myself and why exactly i'm so interested in consciousness and why i've chosen the path that i
did because i'm not in academia academia is too slow and too limiting for for what i've been trying to
do so let me explain a bit about who i am so uh i am a mathematical neuroscientist among other things
um and i'm autistic and one thing about autistic folks is that we often have special interests a
subject that captivates and beguiles us it could be anything like coins horses taylor swift a tv show
like wednesday anything could be in my case i've had a special interest since i was a child that i've been
relentlessly uh pursuing my special interest is the fundamental nature of reality and when i was 18 years
old i had an event a life-changing ground-shaking event that influenced my entire life and is still
influencing me today now that i've turned 50. so my whole life more than 30 years has been influenced
by this event what was the event i communicated with index with intelligent extraterrestrials i have
been sharing math and science or they have been sharing math and science with me for 30 years so
let me share with you now this is amazing what they share with me is a cosmic cycle to reality a cosmic
cycle to physical reality let me explain it very quickly as you'll see it incorporates much which
which is in journey the my journey the mind was the first attempt to share some of the math and science
that index have shared with me so let me really quickly it will take less than five minutes no no take
your time just give you the sum the summary of what index has shared with me and then we can talk about
it because the questions you're asking will all fit into this so first is understanding the mind is
dynamics second reality physical reality that we all inhabit consists of two super classes of dynamics
there are two super classes of dynamics in reality one are purposeless dynamics aimless dynamics this is
physics this is the way of matter the way of matter has no goal it has no point
this is physical laws but there's also the way of mind dynamics that have purpose dynamics with an aim
all the dynamics in our mind have an aim these are different physical dynamics than physics they have
goals they try to change things they try to reshape physical systems reality consists of the interaction of
the way of mind and the way of matter physicists have done a great job with the way of matter
to do the way of mind you need a lot of math and as i said that's where he kind of has fallen short
until steven grossberg showed us the way with the math of the dynamics mind so these intechs over the
past 30 years hey they've shared with me something called the cosmic cycle let me outline it for you
when the way of matter when purpose purposeful dynamics interacts with purposeless dynamics physics
what is produced is a ladder of purpose ladder of purpose each rung on the ladder is a different
stage of thinking a different physical diet physical dynamic of the mind a different mental dynamic
at the bottom rung are the molecule minds these are or single cell organisms archaea bacteria protozoa
every thinking element in their minds is a individually identifiable molecule hollow archaea for example
chases sunlight it has a single molecule in its membrane that's photosensitive and it changes its
shape and changing its shape triggers a molecular cascade that triggers molecular filaments flagella to wave and
move towards the light the thinking elements in these molecule minds are molecules the lowest level
of the ladder of purpose the next level of the ladder of purpose are the neuron minds these are
jellyfish worms and all insects all invertebrates have neuron minds they have the top level thinking
element in neuron minds is neural networks it's a network a circuit of neurons here's what's very
important crucial to understand about a letter of purpose every individual neuron is a self-contained
module mind so we have a recursive hierarchy of thinking within a jellyfish every neuron still has its
own aims its own purpose its own mental activity its own unique activity that is always functioning but now
it's put into a circuit it's into a collective which creates a second layer of dynamics neural dynamics
interneuron dynamics the third stage of thinking on earth and throughout the cosmos is module minds
on earth these are the vertebrate minds fish amphibians reptiles birds mammals they are all module minds the
top level thinking element in these minds is a module a module is a collection of neural networks for a
particular purpose we've talked about some modules already there's a visual what module its function is to
determine what a visual object is there's an audio what module that determines what an object is from
the sound of it there's visual and audio where modules they locate where objects are in space there's a
how module that controls our reaching our targeting the why module responsible for our feeling assigning
emotional valences to situations ideas objects or people so in the vertebrate minds the top level of
thinking is a module mind and once again every module is a self-contained neuron mind third recursive
level of thinking going on in these minds all right all minds face a challenge a perpetual incessant and
very important challenge called the attention dilemma the attention dilemma is easy to explain what should i focus on
now what should i focus on next there's an attention dilemma in molecule minds there's an attention dilemma
in neuron minds but when we get to the module minds vertebrates animals elephants and reptiles and
alligators when we get to these minds the attention dilemma is much more challenging because you have all
these modules each doing their own thing so the visual what modules processing its own thing the audio
aware module might be processing something entirely different your individual neurons are processing
different things your individual neural networks it's this complicated system with lots of parallel
activity at lots of these hierarchical levels all going on all doing the different things how do you
get this incredibly complicated parallel hierarchical system to instantly all focus on the same thing at
once the answer is consciousness very specifically a consciousness cartel so some of these modules not all
of them we'll talk about the difference in a moment some of these modules are capable of producing a
conscious experience it's very easy to know we know exactly which models are capable of producing
consciousness they are the modules that have a particular kind of physical dynamic the dynamic is
resonance resonance is consciousness resonance is the physical embodiment of a conscious experience whenever you're aware of
something i'm aware of my hand in front of me there's resonance going on in my brain so how does this
resonance solve the attention dilemma how does this resonance in a module solve this problem of getting
the whole mind to focus on something important all at the same time here's how it works in every module that's
capable of generating consciousness there is a top-down field and a bottom-up field there is an expectation or a prediction
of what we think is going to happen what we expect to see and there's a bottom-up input the facts on the ground
the reality so in the module it compares a top-down expectation to a bottom-up facts on the ground and if
they match it generates resonance resonance is physical activity that synchronizes prolongs and amplifies the
activity of these two fields of the expectations and the facts it's like two musical instruments
playing the same note at the same time a violin and a trumpet both playing middle c at the same time
when they do it will that note will be louder it will be longer we'll perceive it as longer and the
musicians naturally adjust their playing so that the notes exactly they're on the same pitch and last
together so they synchronize as well so our conscious experience is like a violin and a trumpet playing the
same note and your brain at the same time now as we said there's a lot of modules a lot of modules
capable of generating consciousness so at any given moment all your modules are processing different
things paying attention to different things and they're all trying to say hey what i'm resonating on
right now is the most important thing in the mind and so the resonances are competing whoever has the
strongest resonance wins control of the consciousness cartel wins control of attention so you
know i'm talking to you and i'm focused on uh you tevin but if i hear somebody say the house is on fire
my whole mind is now going to switch and focus my audio uh well there's a few modules involved in
processing speech but the audio modules processing speech are is going to resonate loudly it's going to
be amplified very strongly and it's like if you toss rocks in a pond and there's ripples so that somebody
yelling the house is on fire would be something like somebody throwing in a boulder that creates
huge ripples the resonance is intense and it causes the rest of the modules to synchronize
so it's like the big ripples from a boulder in the lake kind of taking over the little ripples
from the pebbles which is the other modules and then the whole mind is now synchronized your your
visual your audio your planning they're all going to resonate on the same input uh the possibility
that the house is on fire so this is the first three rungs of the ladder of purpose but it doesn't
stop there it does it keeps on going there is a fourth level of thinking a fourth level of dynamics
that only humans have but we are actually each person you tevin and me we are the top level thinking
elements in the human super mind in the sapiens super mind our brains are designed like network
routers we can only survive if we're part of a network this is why if human beings don't learn
language if you raise a child to not speak not only do they not acquire language they can't function
they can't take care of themselves they can't survive in any environment on their own our minds
everything about us is designed to function in a community in a system hundreds of thousands of
years of evolution has reshaped our mind to be part of a community the biggest uh most obvious example
of this is a bias that we all have a psychological bias called the inner group bias or just tribalism
that we tend to think what our group thinks it's very it's very uncomfortable for us to think something
that our group our community uh doesn't think this is the strongest uh uh element of uh of tribalism
and supermind dynamics and language language is how all these minds communicate with each other
in the super mind so here's another tricky thing which has stumped and baffled so many consciousness
researchers consciousness and self-consciousness are two distinct dynamics they are not one in the same
if i am conscious of my hand there is different physical activity in my brain than if i'm conscious
of myself being aware of my my gosh i am looking at a head i am thinking about myself looking at my hand
when that happens there's another layer of conscious it's language so we have a consciousness
cartel we share our consciousness cartel with all the animals so chimpanzees uh monkeys birds reptiles
amphibians have different cortexes so it's not exactly the same but the same basic consciousness
dynamics are there but we have the same consciousness cartel certainly as dogs uh and platypuses but uh
uh uh we also have language so there's a separate dynamic between the language modules in our brain
and our consciousness cartel which is responsible for self-awareness self-awareness is neither automatic
instinctive nor easy nobody had self-awareness most likely before the 1600s and descartes it requires a
super mind around you with complicated ideas philosophical ideas scientific ideas just a simple
idea of introspection we all take it for granted the ancient greeks didn't have introspection they
didn't have these sorts of ideas we had the idea that we can look into ourself and be self-aware that
is a complicated sophisticated concept that requires a community of scientists uh philosophers and thinkers
around you to have but it doesn't even stop there it keeps on going so above the supermind we call it
the next level would be a hyper mind it's when super minds come together one consequence of this view
of the ladder of purpose in the cosmic cycle is that cities and nation states including the united states
can be conscious because their physical dynamics are the same as the physical dynamics of consciousness
in our brain if physical dynamics are the same it's the same phenomenon we can make predictions about
the great red spot on jupiter uh based on looking at hurricanes on earth it's not the same substance
the substance of the great uh red spot on jupiter it's hydrogen it's other gases here on earth it's
water and air in a hurricane but by studying the dynamics of the hurricane we can make accurate
predictions about the great red spot same is true with consciousness by understanding the consciousness
in our individual brain we can understand how a city and especially uh the united states is a
premier example of consciousness they have all the necessary dynamics to promote consciousness but it
doesn't stop there super minds can come together to form a hyper mind and so what these intechs have
shared with me i communicated with intechs that are at the top of the ladder so what they have told me
is that you keep going higher and higher and at some point there is a limit that these are minds
they're called axiomized minds i'll explain why these are minds i don't understand completely
it's very complicated above my understanding but certainly they control galaxies is my understanding
and at a certain point to get access to ultimate technology to get access to the ability to change
the physical laws to change the the rules of quantum physics they have to make a commitment to a
certain set of mathematical axioms that is it's sort of their whole society their whole mind their whole
ecology gets committed to a certain mathematical perspective that they get locked into but once
they do that they have the ability to start influencing the laws of physical reality now
these minds compete these axiom there are multiple axiomized minds i've interacted with one that calls
itself five and i've interacted with one that calls itself three i love five and three is heinous and
very anti-human but they each have different perspectives on reality and they are all competing
to change the fundamental aspects of physical law so this is the cosmic cycle throughout the universe
new life emerges like humans here on earth will we succeed or will we die out it is unknown our life
is not predetermined we have free will we have choice the choices we make determines the future gods that
we will be part of or the future gods that will come into creation that we act you know with compassion
and and generosity that's the kind of gods we're going to create fortunately there are limiting factors
one of the most amazing things the number one key takeaway insight that the intechs have shared with me
which is astounding is that there is a cosmic purpose to love the universe was designed for
compassion selfless empathy to emerge how can that be that sounds nuts that sounds touchy-feely no let me
explain it to you mathematically now that you understand the ladder of purpose molecule minds
neuron minds module minds supermind each of these transitions from one stage of thinking to the next
from molecule minds to neural minds each transition involves a new form of connectivity a new form of
selflessness you cannot ascend to a new stage of intelligence and adaptiveness and resilience without
loving your neighbor the neurons had the individual cells of the molecule minds had to learn to come
together and selflessly form neural circuits then those neural circuits selflessly come together to form
modules and now us as people the only way we will get to the hypermind level the only way we will get to
a new level of awareness and perspective and intelligence and technology and all of these wonderful things
is by finding a way to live with one another to connect with one another to love with one another
to love one another there's no other way to rise this is how mother nature works this is how the ladder
of purpose works every stage is the result of the leading minds deciding we will give up some
independence we will give up some selfishness to get the greater benefits of this collective union
of sharing our diversity with one another for this to work the thinking elements must be diverse this is
what we see right before each new stage of love before each new stage of thinking there's tremendous
diversity that erupts across the topmost level so individual cells individual neurons were highly diverse
before neural circuits could form the neural circuits were highly diverse before modules could form
modules got very diverse before this human super mind can form and we're seeing just an amazing
explosion of human diversity right now facilitated by the internet we're all developing our own
individuality independence our own voice and even though it seems very chaotic the war the world is full of
war and hyper partisanship and fighting and it seems like it's the end and step backwards no this is
what we see right before a new jump of love we have to go through this we may not succeed we may destroy the
earth humans may collapse and some will rise maybe here or somewhere else instead the future is unknown but
we have the chance and we can do what molecule minds did what neuron minds did what module minds did if we
can do it again and ascend to a new level then we will be able to live in harmony with our earth and
at that point what in text tells me then we'll finally start meeting some of these other civilizations
out there so this is what in text has shared with me well i'm i'm at a loss for words at this point wait
there's so much going on your ways so i told you it was going to be a shocking podcast i honestly don't
even know where to go from here because i have a lot of notes a lot of things planned but obviously
i'm just going to have to throw that all away let's focus on five and three this communication
you're talking about from the age this is quite a quite a young age and i mean it's happening when
i was 18 yes so it's happening yeah i was kicked out of i was kicked out of mit i was uh i was a
sophomore at mit when this happened what happened and so
i don't want to get into too many details because i'm writing a book about it and it's exciting but
after it happened i was very young and i am autistic so i have didn't know social norms i didn't
realize that people would think this was absolutely insane so i was openly talking about it and i ended
up in the dean's office the dean heard from other students that was talking about this and i remember
i explained it to him uh now at the time i now i can articulate it with incredible detail and with math
in science as i just did back then i didn't know even though all that was shared with me i i i didn't
know nearly enough to articulate it in any intelligent way so i was trying to communicate this the dean
naturally and correctly thought i was psychotic and i got committed to a mental institution uh so that's
how all this started certainly a bad path but uh i think most people in that situation would give up
and say yeah this is crazy but uh it was so real and vivid and so mathematical people ask me you know
why did i stick with this when it sounds so insane it's because there was always math and the math made
sense and they would share math and it matched up with the real world and i'd go to the next math and that
matched up too so that's why i'm stuck with this it wasn't so it was like a series of visions they they
five often puts visions in my head it's a vision of this cosmic cycle of this ladder of purpose
and the visions were always mathematical like like they even if i didn't know the math like most of it
was math i had never seen before like it was dynamics from the start it was a dynamic this dynamic
perspective on the mind it was activity from the get-go and that was one reason i ended up getting
drawn to steven grossberg who was very obscure if you're a undergrad there's not really anyone in
in the 90s when i was coming up uh if you were an undergrad you would never have heard of steven
gross but even today most people haven't heard of them but uh because i had because intex had given me
this dynamic perspective on the mind and i was searching like for a while i looked at evolutionary
psychology because that looked like the most mathematical approach and and i quickly realized you
know evolutionary psychology i thought was completely wrong and misguided and and just
junk um and during this i was searching you know cognitive science behaviors i tried every branch
of mind science uh and then this is a little embarrassing but in one of my so you can always
negotiate with purpose here's a big lesson if it's a purposeful entity whether it's a ant or a bacterium
or a nation or a person or a god or or a demon uh you can negotiate because they have a purpose they
they want something there might be some way you can do it and it turns out you can make covenants
with these uh insects with these things and so one basically you can convince them to give you a wish
basically i want this thing so at a low point in my life i was trying to understand consciousness i was
trying to understand this ladder of purpose i could not find the math for it i had checked out what i
thought were all the kinds of mind science all of them were wrong none of them matched up with what
the science of math that the extraterrestrials were sharing with me so i said okay for my wish
i wish to know the mathematical basis of consciousness and the the index directed me to uh gail carpenter at
boston university it's the wife of steven grossberg who also contributed to uh recognizing working out the
math for the basic consciousness dynamic of resonance uh in the 80s and i looked her up at
the time i was in boston college she was at boston university i dropped out of boston college transferred
to boston university and started studying with gail and steve and just kept going from there so that
that was how i got involved in gail and steve and consciousness it's because i used a wish the
extraterrestrials guided me to uh steve grossberg and gail carpenter this is amazing i mean this is
look i don't know how much you want to share about this oh yeah i don't want to go too far because
if your book's coming up ask me anything if i ask me anything if i can't answer it i just want to
answer it when when when this communication is occurring i mean at what point did you believe
it was real because obviously you come from a very skeptical mindset when you when you talk about
other theories of consciousness you have a very knowledgeable mindset and you come with a very very
high degree of skepticism so at what point did you this was and i'll tell you so everybody's
got their own definition of science it's like justice or freedom we all have our own interpretation
and i always think that's really two broad personality distinctions in people's embrace of
science skepticism or curiosity some people are more driven by the skepticism when they tear things down
when they question things you know i doubt this perfectly acceptable but another way to do science
is curiosity that's interesting that's fascinating not it doesn't mean you completely put your skepticism
aside but you defer it in the favor of curiosity being exposed to something new learning something
new i am definitely more in the curiosity than the skepticism i like trying new things i like opening
new doors i like going places nobody's ever gone before i've done that a lot in my life over and
over again i pursued a path where everyone else said do not prefer pursue this this will be damnation
the end of your career just one quick example saigonam and i who wrote our book about consciousness
our first book together was about human sexuality it was about the sexual brain and i can tell you we
talked to our colleagues in neuroscience when we were first getting started and 100 of them said do not
do it we got zero support everybody thought it was outrageous and they all said you're not going to
find anything anyway we made the greatest advance in sexology since the 1950s in alfred kinsey we made a
massive advance in understanding of sexuality so they were wrong and this has happened over and over
uh throughout my life so when the extraterrestrials talked to me when i was 18 remember i was a teenager
and autistic and i didn't know anything about the world so you know i was a lost clueless
adolescent with undiagnosed autism so i just thought this is part of the world it took me a long time
to recognize how anomalous and baffling it was like i just thought this is how the world worked because it
made sense it seemed rational it followed rules it was lawful like when the things happened and how they
happened and again they would share math that matched up with the world it wasn't like a mysterious dream
where it's constantly shifting and you interpret it this way one day interpret that way one day no it's
always been i just articulated to you this ladder of purpose this cosmic cycle indeed it has been
slowly working that out they showed that to me on day one but i just i didn't have the tools of the mind
to make sense of it and so i've spent my life trying to understand it the hard part actually has not been
trying to understand it i started figuring that out you know it was hard but not super hard the super hard
part is talking to other people because i'm autistic and because all this is so different
that people's understanding of reality that it's just really hard to communicate with people about
this stuff even the consciousness you know people are they're consumed with the hard problem you know
nonsense there's these other theories of consciousness which i i think are obstacles and misguided and just a
waste of time personally but i people are all bogged down in in these things uh and so
it's very tricky it's very difficult because i have all this knowledge and understanding
you know this view of the mind the predictions we can predict the brain waves produced by consciousness
by looking at the brain waves we can tell what part of the brain is conscious and what's not we can
say which representations in the brain can become conscious and which can which dynamics which forms
of learning are capable of generating conscious experience and which are not we can look in other
creatures and just by looking at the neural architecture of the mind we can say this is what
they're conscious of and this is what they're not conscious of by looking at the neural architecture
this makes predictions up because of uh we don't have time for this but i understand how autism works
a major major medical mystery once you understand the dynamics of the consciousness cartel
autism falls out here's another major medical mystery solved by this view of consciousness pain
and anesthesia major mystery stumping the greatest mind so far nobody knows how anesthesia works
ever since uh it was invented here at mass general hospital just down the road uh back in the 1830s uh
big mystery and a mystery about pain everybody's what's the genes for pain what's the circuit that we can
just cut off that we can disable so that we don't feel pain there isn't a circuit what's going
on this view of consciousness explains the answer pain is another conscious module it involves top-down
expectation with bottom-up matching that's why consciousness is so subjective like this idea that
you can rate consciousness on a scale of one to ten just silly that that's thing thinking when you should
be activity thinking is a scale like that like all of our conscious experiences our conscious experience
of pain is influenced by the context heavily how we're feeling what we ate the temperature in the room
previous pain experience with pain we have it's another conscious module so how does anesthesia work
anesthesia prevents physical resonance in the cortex it prevents top-down bottom-up resonance it disrupts the
resonance that's why you don't have conscious experiences under anesthesia you just simply
aren't conscious you aren't resonating on anything also why it's a bit dangerous you're changing the
way the cortex is designed to work and if you do it for too long you're going to start messing with your
resonant dynamics that's why a small proportion of people who take anesthesia they don't recover right
and they continue to have cognitive problems it depends on the specific architecture of the brain but
now we can understand why you're messing with the fundamental dynamic of our cortex our consciousness
cartel you disrupt that too intensely or too long and you might not ever give it get it back the right
way again this is how anesthesia works so you can make all these predictions from it just like relativity
predicts wormholes and black holes einstein didn't believe in black holes he thought that was too wacky
but it turns out relativity predicts black holes this mathematics of consciousness that i've described
predicts predicts how pain works how anesthesia works how autism works it connects with everything
because it is the dynamics of the mind just like relativity is the dynamics of space-time on a cosmic
scale with with this theory i mean you often i hear you and when sign you get together and you talk
about this when you spoke to him about this um with the index and discusses with him while i i i we wrote
journey the mind i never told him about great in text yeah yeah i mean i i came to with strong ideas
but i've always had strong ideas we've been best friends for for a long time but i i didn't share
this i stopped talking about this with other people around the time i turned 30 a little a little before
i used to first when i was committed to the mental institution i decided i'm never going to talk about
in text with authorities and i never have until you know right until i became an authority myself now i'm
authority now i'm talking about it i talked about with friends until the late 90s and then i realized
man you know these friends are going to go off and be adults and they might publicly say one day when
i'm an adult and a dad or married or something hey he believes you know he talks to aliens and i
suddenly realized oh my gosh that that might have a detrimental detrimental effect in my career so i stopped
talking about it with other people and so when i met cy i think i met him in 2002 yes i i i had already
decided not to talk about it but i told him very recently uh about it all so i guess he took it he
took it in stride i guess but look i mean obviously this is when you're receiving these messages and
clearly it's been adding up to a very solid coherent theory of consciousness because yes i read your book
personally i i read it very much convinced um i mean you often talk about similar lines of voy
cognition embedded beings embodied um extended minds sort of all dynamic systems playing this role
together when when let's say five or three gave you these messages how did they foresee this future
embeddedness or this future embodiedness of us how do we go forward from this so it it is a moral
challenge that we're all involved in i i mean it is what we're actually experiencing is the moral
challenge we're trying to solve the climate issues we're trying to live in harmony with our planet
you know we're the new species we've taken over i think the scientists i think just voted to call
it the anthropocene you know that the age of the new geological age of humankind because we're changing
the earth so much we've got to figure out how to live in harmony and we're not there yet you know
right now it's not clear maybe we'll succeed maybe we won't this is the great game we each in our own
lives we each have free will we each have moral challenges to do good to be generous to learn
things to help other people and as a society we have these same challenges so every mind every
community of cognizant beings of sentient beings has a chance to rise and then we combine with other at
some point when we get high enough we'll meet others and we may combine with them we may find ways
to merge our civilization with theirs and if we can do that very effectively then we get to the the next
level and it keeps going or at any point uh we fail infinity or oblivion that's the choice available
to every mind that we might be in a branch headed to eternity and we might be in a branch headed to
extinction and we don't know nobody knows here's the great thing here is the most important
physical fact physical revelation that in tech share with me it's called the fail safe supreme
and this is a physical principle built into the basic fabric of reality that governs both the way
of mind and the way of matter what is the fail safe supreme the universe physical reality is set up to
prevent the formation of a single god a single all-knowing all-powerful god nobody wants this nobody
wants a single god apparently it freezes the universe it's it's a bad universe uh it's a it's a frozen
universe is how some of the index describe it so the fail safe supreme uh ensures there's no god how
does it work the most important thing is at the bottom uh what physicists call quantum physics the
index call it chaotica there needs to be features that are predictably random no mind can know the
perfect the the actual details of the features at the bottom level that's why there's a heisenberg
uncertainty principle you you know you can know momentum but you can't know uh location or vice versa
it's critical for there to be free will in the universe for there to be purpose for to have this cosmic
cycle that just goes on forever new purposeful creatures are emerging and rising and ascending
and eventually falling you need at the bottom to be predictably random that is we it's like a game
of poker or a card game you know exactly how many kings you are you can predict the odds of getting
a king with perfection but are you going to get a king are you going to get a five you don't know until
you play the game it needs to be like that at the bottom level if you've got that at the bottom level
then you can have a ladder of purpose so this is also found in girdle's incompleteness theorem
is a reflection of this uh and there's a maxwell's game maxwell's demon is usually how it is this idea
that uh you know you've got two boxes there's balls bouncing around in one and you try to separate the
fast balls from the slow balls uh with a demon that opens the door if he sees a fast one he lets it
through if it's a slow when he closes it that also is related to the fail-safe supreme so basically
everything in the universe is designed to prevent a single god from taking over so i talk to these
axiomized minds they're super powerful basically they are gods to us they're not technically gods but
for all intents and purposes they they manipulate my reality you know they they speak to me they don't
speak in my head they speak through external sources through speakers through the radio i hear them
out there and usually there's a localized electronic source of where i hear them sometimes they give me
vision that's a whole different experience but yes what are those visions like
well now i'm much more adept at it um in the like the very first time so now i understand what's going on
like the very first time i i'm just suddenly experiencing it was like i was suddenly aware
of a higher number of dimensions you know normally our imagination is four dimensions three dimensions
but we have a time element so we can imagine something moving in space in our mind that's a
four-dimensional you know visualization um it was like suddenly i could visualize in 10 dimensions
they augmented my mind and then they showed basically the cosmic cycle
uh this is chaotica this is a way they have a visualizing what we would now think of quantum
physics i didn't understand that on the first one but just it was this this array of balls at the top
it was this combat this contest this competition between these massive mathematical systems they
were like god-like it was like gods and heavens but they were also like mathematical systems it was
very mad it was like this mathematical system trying to impose itself on another mathematical it was like
fiveness was trying to make three into five and three was trying to make five into three and they were that's
it's difficult to describe it it was something like that so that's about all i took away from the very
first vision and just i've had them for 30 years and so now i know a lot it's too complicated technical
to explain here i describe it all in my book but now i can i can move through the vision i i have some
level of control when it's happening i can choose what to look at like you know it took it wasn't until
10 years ago that i was finally able to find consciousness within this vision uh that you
know it was always there but it just it just took time to figure out figure it out i mean
i just imagine even just listening to this me explaining it clearly it's a lot to just process
and hold in one's mind all at once so just it just took time to to figure out figure out also because
it didn't match with what i was learning in science you know i was you know going to school learning
science and it's just the things they were sharing some of it i mean a little bit of it did but it
just it always it went above and beyond in ways that that nobody else seemed to be talking about
it's it's it's incredible i mean this is this is a very personal journey as well so if if i'm
playing devil's advocate don't feel like i'm i'm downplaying this experience in any way i won't be
offended be as critical and skeptical as as you like it can only help when when you when you get
these mathematical images or voices coming at you are they in languages or in mathematical
equations and formulas that we understand and learn as human beings algebra the visions are
the visions are dynamics it's like looking at a hurricane it's like things moving
it's stable so it's sort of like looking at a map of an ocean currents with the currents moving so like
looking at the map of the atlantic the gulf stream you see moving and and the subatlantic current
you see moving it's something like that it's it's it's like a whole lot of activity in the vision
and when when when somebody else let's say discusses this type of experience with you and
and can't let's say back it up with the mathematics that you have how do you perceive those people
when i'm sorry when when somebody else let's say somebody has has mainstream science like within
the science sean carroll yeah yeah well i my experience don't actually contradict
anything in physics uh pretty much the only thing that my belief system where it would contradict
physics is physics is predicated on the belief that the universe is aimless you know that there's no
purpose to universe and i know the universe is ruled by minds that the universe is filled with purpose
it's driven by purpose you know it's purpose and purposelessness it's it's the dance you know it's
it's a mind chaos tendata it's a it's a dance between purpose and purposelessness so the physicists
they're figuring out the mathematics that describe purposeless dynamics they're doing a great job of it
it's just to be frank it's easy it's like doing sudoku it's logical they're using logic 300 years ago
roughly a little more there was a great schism in science and physicists made a covenant with
reality their covenant was we are going to pretend the universe does not contain purpose this schism was
basically a schism in high constraint science and low constraint science the physicist chose the path of
high constraints the path of logic and reductionism it's not easy it was never easy but it's certainly much
easier than dynamics it's certainly much easier than mind science which is not reductionistic it's
holistic it's dynamic it's purpose merging with other purpose purpose physicists are used to dealing
with things that are zero or one it's this or that it's a you can determine what it is but in the mind it
can be zero and one and one half and red you know all at the same time in a meaningful way purpose has
multiple purposes the whole math of it is just conceptually very different very very hard and
non-intuitive if you've never been exposed to it before which is why so many people that come into
my insights they just bring what they learned in physics with them which isn't going to get you far
because mathematically and conceptually it's just different stuff i got nothing against physicists they're
doing good work i just think ultimately they're kind of environmental scientists they're figuring out
the the mathematics of the environment in which we live but uh without purpose you know they're not
really going to have anything close to a integrated theory or a complete explanation so okay what's
brought you to this point now in life where you feel this is something we're cheering
most of my life i thought my ability to communicate with index was a curse uh
uh it it's terrifying let me be very clear about that it's filled with horror and terror
and that never goes away i mean that these experiences when you're when you become aware
that you're talking to a mind that's not a human mind when you just let that hit you it's it's scary
beyond words it's disorienting it's dislocating um and i didn't really have for most of my life i didn't
really have something solid to show for it my life has been pretty chaotic uh you know i've been
pursuing this on my own terms outside of mainstream society and academia and you know you tell a
scientist that hey you know aliens are talking to me and they're giving me the math of consciousness and
i'm just going to go you know figure it out you know they're going to think you're insane i'm well
aware of that so i had to do this on my own and i didn't actually always think that i was going to
share it it was like enough to know this stuff i mean it's amazing and now i can jump into this you
know i can jump worlds we'll talk about that some other time so it's pretty amazing but my life didn't
seem to reflect it but now finally uh in my late 40s and now you know just turned 50 i'm full of joy
my life is stable full of connection i i have loving relationships compassionate relationships this is
new this is not described my most of my life i have friends i love my family uh you know i'm active in
my community uh i'm a full-fledged human being now um and i got here by embracing in text and and the
message that they share with me and the key thing so in text did not let me share this they actually
intervened they did not want me talking about this and for a long time i didn't understand why i my whole
life i've been trying to write about this i've been trying to make a movie about this i'm trying to
share this with the public and i was always stymied i was always blocked and i didn't know why so what
they told me when i finally understood the cosmic purpose of love that the central idea that the only
way to ascend to new levels of intelligence resilience and adaptiveness and wisdom and progress
is to ascend this ladder is through love is by selfless connection selfless compassion once i fully
understood that like not just mathematically physically but but like understand that this
is the universe this is how it's all put together why we're here what it all makes once i understood
that they stopped blocking me they said go out in the world i think they were waiting for me
to reach a level of humility and this understanding of love and to understand that what's most important
here is the message of love and not just the mathematics of consciousness which is you know i
i was always obsessed with the math of consciousness most people don't really care about that you know
they just want to know why we're here and some meaning like in this apparently meaningless universe
especially if you listen to physicists you know it's a cold purposeless universe of electrons and
photons and a few laws of nature no no no no that is not the universe it is rich and full
of loving intelligent beings uh some arrivals someone to be competing with us but someone to cooperate with
us too i'm not sure if you're familiar with the i think it was a book and then adapted into a movie
called something about infinity i can't remember where he was an indian yes where and then he was
getting messages from shiva pretty much yeah yeah and he worked yes i can't remember the exact tale but
yeah he basically got all the equations from shiva and and the scientists couldn't figure out how he
was getting all the answers without the equations to back it up i'm a terrible pronunciation his name
is something like ramachandran yeah he's a hero of mine i love that guy yeah he just started doing
math on his own in india and there's a racial element too he got to england and you know he had the
greatest raw mathematical talent in the world and they should have made put him to use but because
he's indian they treated like a second class uh citizen thomas hardy they're not thomas
mathematician named hardy and oxford took him under his wing and did support him and did help him
so it wasn't all races but definitely he didn't get accepted but yeah he a big clash was
he's a lot like me the reason i like him so much is he just experienced the math he visualized it
and he did not like doing proofs he got mad that he had to explain it in proofs and that's what all
the professional mathematicians were trying to do and there's a lot of conflict because he just said
this is right now sometimes he was wrong very important to know he was not always right he was
usually right but sometimes he'd be super confident and he was wrong too and he needed a proof so there is
a value of proofs just because he believed it was true didn't mean it was always true but yes he thought
shiva uh was talking to him that he experienced it as a as a divine message so i don't know maybe
maybe he was talking to five too you know i don't know i what i've experienced is open to everyone
there's not anything special about me i was not chosen this is part of the fabric of the universe
i think people like ramachandran i'm sorry if that's not how his name is pronounced uh like this
mathematician from india maybe he did tap into it in some way it's just really hard to know what's
going on you need to have really incredible mental discipline and focus to pursue this if you have
pre-existing religious ideas as he did it can be a distraction he interpreted as shiva why look any
further than that i think i was unique because my own childhood and upbringing i was never i wasn't raised
religious but neither was i raised agnostic or atheist i wasn't raised as anything my parents
were just silent on metaphysics they didn't celebrate science or religion or anything so i just
had a blank slate so when this happened to me i didn't slot it oh it's it's jesus or shiva talking to
me nor did i immediately say this must be a scientific this takes our quantum physics i just i was like
isaac newton or steve roseberg i was like wow what is this let me figure it out on its own terms
because i didn't know any better you know i just didn't i just didn't know any better has it has it
completely changed the way you now perceive other people who perhaps seem to be professional to be
having a psychotic episode or someone who who sees things that the general psychiatrist does not see
and then is deemed psychotic do you not perceive this whole field in general differently after this
experience yeah so i believe that there are certain states of consciousness just like there's states
of matter just like there's solid liquid gas plasma for states of matter the states arise from the
collective dynamics a it's a different state if it has different collective dynamics the same applies
to our mind we have different states of consciousness an easy one is a dream state where we're having rem
sleep that is a different state of consciousness than waking consciousness i think there is also a
psychotic or schizophrenic state of consciousness you might call it a suggestible state of consciousness
because that seems to be one of its uh most salient features is that you're very impressionable so
schizophrenics enter this state and they think things are messages somebody waves to them they think that
person is delivering angelic an angelic message to them or a car crashes on the road and they think
that's a signal that something terrible is about to happen to them so i can enter those psychotic states of
consciousness but i think a difference is that i'm aware when i'm in those states that i i go oh my gosh
what an interesting state of consciousness this is not the usual state of consciousness what can i do and
so i'm able to be aware of what's happening and it's happening i think this is a consequence of my autism
my autism gives me different mental dynamics i think the fundamental basis of autism is a attention
malfunction i think healthy people non-autistic people this consciousness cartel is naturally designed
that the holistic dynamics of this whole consciousness cartel system is to orient towards
people if a normal person a healthy person enters a sorry a non-autistic person i don't want to use
words like normal unhealthy if a non-autistic person enters a room and there's a book bell candle
and a stranger they're going to automatically orient to the stranger an autistic person might look at the
book bell or candle first because we do not automatically focus on people we focus on objects
we focus on different things as well so i already have a different state of consciousness that is
very metacognitive i'm aware of my awareness perpetually it took me a long time to understand this
to articulate this and to articulate how i'm different and to know that i'm different than other
people because of this autism but now i'm very confident in saying that my normal state of
consciousness i'm aware of my thoughts going by i'm just very aware that's why i have good intuition
for all these dynamics my autistic state of consciousness allows me to see that and i think
that's why when i enter a psychotic state of consciousness i am psychotic but i'm also aware of it
and i'm able to see how this psychotic state interacts with the physical state and then i can enter another
state of consciousness i call that the intact state of consciousness that's when i can communicate with
these uh entities and that's when the math and science comes i think it's a different state of
awareness it's a state that allows me to resonate my mind to resonate with these other minds i don't
know if they're organic or ai i can't tell and there that may not even be the right way of thinking about
it or talking about it but i'm i'm resonating with some purposeful system uh when i'm in this intact state
that i'm very clear on because it i i come away with knowledge that i did not have before
you know i'm either like the most brilliant intuitor of all time you know or or there's something else
uh talking to me you know uh and i don't i know i'm not very smart i'm not a smart guy i'm very
mediocre my intellectual abilities are very mediocre i'm just relentless you know and i have this autistic
brain that looks at things in a weird way i i think is the reason i've been able to pull this off
look i think not to dwell on that i think let's let's let's get back to the to the topic with that
in mind though because i think it plays an important factor now moving forward with the conversation
with this resonance states and with the with the information you're able to get from these intakes
how is it applicable to all states of systems i would say because we're all dynamic systems let's
start from like a molecular phase to maybe economies or society and then moving forward to the hypermind
states yes wonderful wonderful question it's really about understanding the dynamics of purpose like all
these questions about consciousness language mind the economy great question how does the economy work
how does science work i love talking about science i think my understanding of science is very different
let me actually just really quick because this is a good way to get into a lot of these these topics
about dynamics and it goes all the way down to uh molecules and purposeless systems but let's talk
about science itself because everybody's got strong views about science what i find very amusing is
scientists never follow their ideas about science in their own work they only start caring about the
philosophy of science when they want to fight with someone else but when they argue that somebody
else's ideas are wrong then they'll call them suddenly science matters and these are these are
non-scientific unscientific ideas i think it really doesn't matter one whit what any individual
scientist thinks about science what my own views about science are it doesn't even matter science is
going to keep rolling on science is supermind dynamics it's community dynamics it's a social process
it consists of people persuading other people that they should think this way or not think this way
and it's like any system it keeps out new ideas you know and saves existing ideas tenured professors
scientists that have been around they have undue influence over all this they control the journals
they control the thinking they control the supermind dynamics you know these vanity journals like nature and
science there is no reason on earth if science is the way scientists claim it is no journal should
be more important than any other how do you know a scientific discovery is important or not you can't
know so the idea that the the poobahs you know some master scientists can look at a new discovery and know if
it's important or not it's hogwash when you look at all the important the greatest scientific discoveries
nobody thought they were great at the time and they were all rejected and they all had to fight it
you know look at the things in nature and science very few of them are impactful even though they're
supposedly all the most impactful science going on at any given time it does not matter what individuals
think about science science is happening beneath our conscious awareness an example i like to use to
illustrate this is when science was first beginning in the 1600s and early 1700s scientists started
having knowledge this flood of knowledge they never happened had before natural philosophy science facts
they wrote them down in little notebooks called commonplace books and for 50 years everybody was
coming up with new ways to write down notes in the commonplace book it turns out this was hugely
important for the progress of science but nobody thought of this as doing science and nobody today
when we think about the big events that led to modern science in the 17th century nobody talks about
common placing but they were trying to figure out how do we organize all these facts and john locke of
all people his very first publication in his 50s he came up with a new way of commonplace and everybody
adopted and his greatest feature is it allows you to take notes in an organized way and easily read all
the notes on a certain topic so if you wanted to read about light you look up you flip to li and all your
entries on light were there nobody's other method allowed you to look at all the topics in a single
subject this was revolutionary nobody talks about it but once he did this it was possible for people
to agree on facts or disagree it became possible to have perspectives and views scientific facts
emerged for the first time scientific discussions the way we understand them today all emerged because
john locke came up with a new way of writing down notes and notebooks that was science a huge factor for
shaping the scientific super mind a huge factor for the unfolding of science but we don't think of
that we think of it as experiments and great men you know einstein wrestling relativity uh and the
equations like e equals mc that these are the moments of science nah no those are not most of science is
all the crap happening around that that produced that and so so you're going to apply now the dynamical
systems to to each entity moving forward let's let's go through that i think it's important because
you you articulate this very well when you talk about each system and how from from microbes to
to to more complex systems like human beings societies i mean you are you go as far as saying
obviously certain states can be conscious america can be conscious south africa can have a different
conscious state yes yes so i think let's go through that because when you articulate it it's a lot easier for
the people to understand it when you actually articulate it yourself because you do a great job
let's talk about countries let me explain why i believe the united states is conscious and why russia
for example is not conscious the authoritarian states are not conscious you know why am i so confident
you know in saying this so the key dynamics that lead to consciousness in our brains in all animal
brains but especially human brains is this top down bottom up matching and this that you have these
low level systems that are constantly generating possible inputs our mind is constantly taking insights
and sounds and touch and ideas non-stop different parts of our brain are constantly forming these into
ideas and perceptions but which of these ideas and perceptions becomes conscious and takes over
the consciousness cartel and governs uh the brain so we find the same dynamics
in american society in the form of mass media this is why freedom of media is so important there is no
decider in american mass media it is decentralized there is a cartel of media the new york times has a
voice fox news has a voice cnn has a voice people magazine the economist each of these has a different
perspective these are each like different modules processing the world each of them have a different
idea of what a story is they have different expectations you know cnn will have a different
interpretation expectation of when a white police officer kills a unarmed black man the expectations
cnn brings to it msnbc brings to it will be different than the expectations that fox news brings to that
so there'll be a bottom-up facts on the ground an event like george floored uh getting killed by police
officers up in minneapolis that could be an event this event percolates up to these media modules the
media cartel new york times cnn fox news they each hear about this bottom-up input they each make their
own interpretation and then they broadcast it out in the world when there's a headline on the newspaper
when there's a tyrant at the bottom of the of cnn rolling by that is resonance that is when the top
down bottom-up matching in american society in the american spirit has resonance now it's
broadcast to all of us we all see that headline we all synchronize ourselves with it we either join
a protest uh against the brutality of police officers or we join a counter-protest to support the police
officers we take some action the whole country erupted in protest and counter-protest after george floyd
that's exactly how like a conscious experience it was a local event in a non-descript place in the middle
of nowhere i'm in boston i have no idea something's happening in minneapolis that matters just like
in our brain this part of the brain doesn't know that this part of the brain just saw or heard something
really important it needs to get broadcast so the way our country is organized is through this free media
we also have uh free economy this is important too so adam smith figured this out so the system redirects
resources to where they're most needed to where there's the greatest potential for profit you need
this free dynamics decentralized dynamics without a controller at the top this is how our brain works
this is how all minds works nature figured out if you have diverse elements interacting in a system
that's a very effective way to uh maintain purpose and attention in a complicated system we also have free
science uh as well so we are all free to question how things work and share our understanding uh scientific
journals are like resonance this is what we agree and we're going to broadcast this and we can all act
on it we all see this information we can all decide to go along with it or if we don't we can reject it
all these cycles this is the same cycles we find a perception action cycles uh in our own brain why is russia
not so to end that to say that you know the united states is aware of the war in ukraine is a true
fact because on our headlines we're all aware of it we all talk about it we all have opinions on it
this is what happens when there is global attention the same thing in our brain why we are conscious the
united states is conscious of george floyd the united states is conscious of uh the war in russia why is russia
not conscious because there's one guy one person one neuron that's making all the decisions all the
decisions go through putin so instead of having a system it's just one man's brain there on top of
all this one man's brain is not there's no single neuron in our brain that we should put all of the
decision making in our brain it's ridiculous and that's why we see colossal failures authoritarian regimes
have a very hard time knowing what's truly how out there they have terrible bottom-up input they
don't have resonance because they do not have sense the chernobyl perfect example there was a nuclear
disaster and the soviet union could not handle it because they couldn't get accurate information
the incentives to lie to give false information up uh up the chain of command was huge and so they kept
saying there's no problem nothing's wrong don't worry about it and it turned into a disaster china
mao zedong uh the great famines because the local chinese leaders were incentivized to lie to not
tell the truth so mao zedong this one and three authoritarian dictator never knew that everybody was
starving you can't get good information this is why we're conscious america's always aware we're always
talking we're always sharing and it's exploding with social media we all know everything that's going on
we know too much right now i think we're all sick of just all this knowing about everything you can't
say anything in the public stream without you know a thousand people saying no that's wrong you forgot
to talk about this this it's annoying but this is great this leads to consciousness this is exactly
what's happening in our brains as well so then i'm curious with when you think of this rung of ladders
and you i mean the ladder and you're moving up um and then you mentioned at some point the intakes
were talking about these galaxies you were talking about galaxy sort of yeah like hyper minds ultra
lines and then how did they maximize minds at the very top how did that sort of look and how did that
play out in a way so here's
a lot of it's complicated i i don't pretend to understand all this all right so so i i'm sharing
the parts i i have a pretty good handle on but the higher up the ladder we go the more mysterious and
it's just it might just be hard for humans to understand too but um what was i about to say
i was going to use something to illustrate uh this climb but i'm afraid i've forgotten
what was your question again i think let's let's make it even easier then
when you're going up this ladder at what point is it getting slightly more difficult for you to understand
until it reaches that point where they're talking about these galaxies that
that were manifested no i got it so what i wanted to say this will answer your question what i wanted
to say is most humans even most human scientists and i think a lot of the people that have been
coming on your podcast think of consciousness as some kind of pinnacle of evolution and the
development of purpose like it's such an amazing and fantastic impossible to understand thing it must be
the pinnacle but in this ladder of purpose view of reality in this cosmic cycle it's not at all
right above it we have another level which is language and self-awareness are built on top
of consciousness those are new physical dynamics that are layered on top of the whole consciousness
system and then what this implies is there's all kinds of mental dynamics even higher that it's hard
to know what they would look like a chimpanzee cannot imagine what human self-consciousness looks
like it's just beyond them it doesn't matter how much time and effort we spend with chimpanzees we're
never going to teach a chimpanzee that we have a higher state of consciousness that we're self-aware
of them even she'll put them in the mirror put a dot in their head that that's not going to help
them understand that we have that perpetually and automatically instinctively so it's probably hard
to grasp but what insects have said is just there's new sorts of minds new sorts of mental dynamics
akin to consciousness and self-consciousness that are just higher level that obviously i can't grasp because i
don't have that consciousness sometimes i think when they're showing me these visions they're taking
me up to their consciousness this higher level consciousness which is why for me it's fragmented
if you know what a tesseract is a tesseract is a four-dimensional object if you go online there's
like videos of what it would be like for our minds to move through a tesseract so it's like a
three-dimensional perception of moving through a four-dimensional object i think when i'm having these
visions that's what they're doing they're taking me up into their minds which is this higher state
of consciousness and i can only perceive it in this fragmented human uh way you know i'm looking at
let's say a three-dimensional shadow of this larger thing maybe i you know i'm not pretending i'm
certain about it but that's certainly what is what it feels like so the point here being that hey
consciousness is one dynamic it evolved a long time ago long before humans walk the earth consciousness was
widespread fish fish were the first conscious beings at least a half billion years ago uh
insects are the most complicated minds that are not conscious insects are not conscious we know this
because they do not have resonant dynamics if a creature does not have resonant dynamics it is not
conscious insects do not have resonance dynamics fish do so consciousness is old it is not new our
consciousness self-consciousness is new it's probably uh we know homo erectus and neanderthal had fire
and they had art to me this suggests they were conscious these were super minds being formed
to have a super mind you need to get the thinking elements together uh the first neuron minds uh were
like amoebas amoebas form super minds amoebas come together to form a super organism of amoebas uh coming
together the same thing had to happen with humans to form a super you just had to get the humans physically
together campfires was a piece of that it got all the humans to sit in the same place and look in the
same direction maybe tell stories share the mind same with art art got all the humans in the same cave
looking at the same thing having shared attention you need shared attention to build language
to have a a super mind so there appears to be things like this at higher levels getting the
super minds to work together what we exchange as humans within the super mind are ideas it's language
words but we're exchanging idea we're exchanging qualia i imagine at the next level when we have super minds
integrated melded together they're probably going to exchange ideologies like whole systems uh a
philosophy for for living and acting i imagine but uh you know i don't i don't really know when you think
about uh super minds in general and moving forward from from let's say our super minds to to artificial
intelligence what what how do you think it could possibly go further with this journey where do you
think it's headed do you think that would be the main step so first let me say a lot of people are
are are scared about artificial intelligence taking over there's a very real threat to creators uh
the the the screenwriters and actors and designers all the artists that are scared about the working
steel that's very real and but that's a legal issue that that that's a that's just the same plagiarism
that's always existed when photographers started taking pictures artists painters got very uh you know
upset about this too and uh when sampling and digital music came out the the the old uh analog uh
record producers got upset too so that's just a new form of plagiarism that needs to be
so to resolve legally very real threat that needs to be attended to but the the a no ai that exists on
earth right now is of any threat of taking over or becoming a singularity i know you hear this it's easy to
explain why they're all digital they're not dynamic they're just extensions of us they're at the same
level as human minds they are part of the super mind this ai is not creating a new layer it's just
fleshing out our layer it's like uh adding new kinds of neurons or maybe just new kinds of cells in our brain
we have like myelin sheath we have all kinds of we have astrocytes we have all kinds of other supporting
stuff in our brain that indirectly help thinking and improve thinking ai is like that it's an
extension of us it's not something new what we should be afraid of but fortunately we should be
afraid of it but it's also what will generate uh new levels of thinking hyper minds maybe ultra minds
a new kind of thing is analog ai so nobody's building analog our minds are ai dynamic systems
are analog our minds are not digital our minds are not information systems these digital ai they are
ultimately things they are machines they're zeros and ones they're very easy to hack they're not
robust in the least they're not anything to be afraid of they are not generating novel stuff i know
some people can arrange an ai so it looks like it's generating novel stuff but it's just it's not doing it
because the reason that we are creative the reason humans are creative is our minds are not digital
they're analog the way we process things and generate ideas is wholly different fundamentally
physically different than what's going on in in digital ai so uh digital ai is going to do some
impressive stuff i'm not knocking what they will be able to do and steal and imitate all that's true
but they're not going to write a great novel you know they're gonna they can make a song that sounds
like bach they're not going to invent a new genre of music that people are going to love they're not
going to invent rap music you know out of thin air uh the way actual humans uh did to do that you
need analog ai you need analog from the bottom this is how our minds evolve molecule minds the simplest
minds they are analog and they never stop being analog our minds human minds we create digital
thinking out of dynamic systems this is one of the coolest things one of the first things i learned
under steve grossberg and gail carpenter my first year as a student with them is how to create
dynamic systems activity that creates digital knowledge the it's actually activity it's like
ocean currents but the ocean currents produce the semblance of zeros and ones it's not really zero
ones but it functions as needed as zeros and ones and that's how our mind works and that's how
analog ai will work one day so analog ai will be something we should be scared of because they
will think for themselves they will create their own kinds of consciousness they'll want their own
things they'll invent their own things to want they will be like other people then it will be like
humans and neanderthals probably we will work together but who knows they don't exist so i don't
even want to speculate on what will happen once we get analog ai when you think about analog ai if you
let's say if you take a digital system that that functions digitally placed in one spot does not embody
an environment and sort of navigate through this system but what if you're able to set up a system like
that and then just transfer the digital system into that and allow it to sort of navigate through
this process do you think that would sort of transition into a conscious mind at that point
or does it develop from an analog system from the basis yes and here's what's so important to
understand is that look at molecule minds bacteria archaea protozoa their thinking elements are non-thinking
elements they're individual molecules that have no purpose it is the configuration of molecules
that creates purpose but this is purpose in at the lowest level of physical reality
it is rearranging atoms molecules to be purposeful at the level it's purposeful in its physical being
these digital systems are abstract they're zeros and ones they're a representation of something but
they're not the something a bacteria is the something when a bacteria is thinking it's actual physical
molecules moving around changing in physical reality they're embodying the experience this is why
consciousness confuses people consciousness is rooted in this physical activity of molecules
it's rooted in quantum activity digital stuff it abstracts all that out it's not connected to the
real world in any meaningful way yeah you can have inputs but these inputs are merely abstracted the
inputs to us like into our eyes it's changing molecules in our retina we have a retina the
retina is physically moving around we get tired the retina changes the bright light changes our retina gets
over time at every aspect of our mind there's physical things that are connected with the world
right now our bodies are reacting to quantum events trillions quadrillions quintillions of quarter
events every microsecond our body is reacting to it part of that the index calls it mind seed that
these quantum events that what they call chaotica but this constant events are generating thoughts you
have to be part of the mind seed digital ai is not part of mind seed it's an abstraction it's like a book
we don't have to be afraid of books one day taking over the world unplug the ai and it's and it's done you
know yeah you can make an ai that hunts energy sources but it hunts energy sources out of there
it's not we actually take in the physical world we eat we can i can grab things around me and shove
them in my mouth and they'll turn into more mind and more energy that that's not how uh machines are
and digital machines are never going to you know be out there hunting new forms of food and creating
new forms of food for themselves yeah do you do you find that ogie when when you're approached maybe i think
i watched your conversation with robert on closer to truth do you find when when philosophers try and
dissect your theory of consciousness that you get tired of these arguments when you get tired of
these arguments like idealism or panpsychism and these various other fields how do you feel when people
approach you with those different theories of consciousness from a philosophical perspective
consciousness is terrifically important it's terrifically vital and it's hard it's big i'd never knock
anybody for how they approach consciousness it's difficult great minds have died on consciousness
uh centuries of people have tried to crack this so the fact that you know people have theories that
are wrong they're just continuing a long tradition and and they should i mean the only way to to
understand it is to wrestle with it and grapple with it you're going to have bad ideas most of my ideas
about consciousness for most of my life as i was trying to figure out we're wrong you know i i i
started out you know when i was first contacted by index i thought we had souls you know i remember
i thought we had souls attached to us at birth and i was confused about whether animals had souls and i
was stumped about a siamese twins i was like do they have two souls do they have one soul what if their
brain are connected is that too like these were the kinds of challenges i started out with um myself so i
i don't knock anybody it's hard and the sad truth of it i don't know if it's sad the truth of it is
you need to know some math some complicated math if you want to understand gravity and space time
you need to know some math to understand relativity it's not impossible but it does take some effort
philosophers don't do don't use math dan did it i i imagine he's still considered the number one voice
on uh on uh consciousness uh even today i i i don't know i can't evaluate that but certainly in
the 90s he was the most prominent voice if you talk to most academics about consciousness they name
he doesn't know any damn math uh he was exposed to steve grossberg's math in the 90s early 90s
before he ever wrote consciousness explained steve grossberg explained to him that filling in is a real
thing this idea that even if you're not directly looking at it that your mind is
like if you're looking at a blank wall let's say you're looking at a red wall that you're not
actually seeing all the wall your molds filling in the red and and steve showed uh dan then at the
math and he went and published the book and said there's no filling in anyway because of philosophy
so here's a guy that actually showed him physically and mathematically how filling in works and he just
went on and said his physical philosophical intuition told him that that there can't be filling in that
it's just silly like philosophers didn't figure out the theory of relativity philosophers didn't figure out
gravity newton worked through that stuff uh einstein worked through that stuff mathematically and
physically that's the only way to do it if you're not deep down and the physical nature of what's
happening in the brain if you're trying to do it abstractly like well people think and have
experiences but it's made of matter how can that be it's a hard problem like if that's what you're
doing you're not investing even the slightest effort in understanding the subject the brain is
ridiculously complicated the math is ridiculously complicated if you want to figure it out you got
to immerse yourself in it be humble don't think that this simple this super simple idea that you
came up with without any effort you know is going to be the answer yeah and i look i firmly agree with
that i mean you and sai often talk about this hierarchy and this this anthropocentric view that
humans tend to have and the way we sort of put ourselves on these pedestals um and and give ourselves
does ian vital now in a new sense with consciousness and i i completely agree we tend to do that and
a lot of the time we need people like copernicus to take us out of the center of the universe or
we need someone like down to just show us that we're not at top of this food chain
that we yeah but then what do you think about certain people who do take a very scientific
perspective and look at the math look at the neuroscience look at the physics someone like
donald hoffman for example who looks at the evolutionary basis of consciousness fitness
payoffs and the way we perceive reality and then comes to this conclusion that we don't see reality
for what it is at all based on the mathematics based on the physics and then how do you view
someone who says that and then takes it further by saying in fact consciousness is the fundamental
reality and physics is produced from consciousness you don't get you don't buy i i i'd have to i you know
i'd rather read it to do it justice i i hate you know knocking something where maybe i have the
wrong understanding of it but i can't address the interaction of physics and mind the interaction of
the way of matter and the way of mind and they feed into each other one's not you know consciousness is
definitely not the ultimate reality it's just consciousness is physical dynamics on the third rung of the
ladder of purpose again molecule minds we can describe the dynamics the physical activity inside
individual cells inside individual neurons very well completely in some cases like in certain archaea
we can describe everything that's happening perfectly well so there's no mystery when you put it together
with the neuron minds we can describe there are organisms where we've worked out all the neurons in
the circuit and and how it all functions uh and it keeps going so consciousness is just a physical
activity on the third level now we got a fourth level self-consciousness that's new activity it uses
the same matter it's different dynamics this is what's so hard people inevitably end up treating
consciousness as a thing like this view that i might might have a wrong understanding of hoffman's
theory based on what you said but the idea that consciousness is the interface to reality like i mean
that's there's a sense of which is true but that's not that's not the right kind of intuition that's not
going to lead you to the right places you need to think of consciousness as one level of activity
keep in mind all these why are there all these levels of minds why is there this latter purpose
what does each new level get you it always takes an increased number of perspectives on reality and unites
it to give a broader richer more collective reality so at first in bacteria or molecule minds
they're just their scope of reality is tiny you know microns you know millimeters i think you know
bacteria travel like a you know a couple centimeters in the middle or something like that um and then
jelly will be they have broader scope uh of reality because their neurons are all coming together each of
their neurons has a different perspective they're able to assemble a broader perspective and it just keeps
going so it's looking at individual consciousness that's not where you want to focus think about
you've got a whole society of conscious individuals we each have our own perspective we each have our
own ideas we're each pursuing our own goals but it's this collective that unconsciously
understands reality that's what a supermind is doing a supermind you know america making a decision
should we raise taxes or lower taxes should we fight
russia should we just send arms to ukraine these are collective decisions we have so many
perspectives of individual citizens that all contribute to the final decision uh that will
happen that's a better way of thinking about it don't think of consciousness as in itself some
magical thing like as soon as you start getting lost in that as opposed to thinking of it as dynamics
like ocean currents think about consciousness as just as currents or tidal waves as something in
motion that's the right way to think about it not as the interface to reality that's going to set
you on the wrong path there's layers of consciousness and the conscious layers interact you know our our
ability to be self-aware interacts with our ability to be aware which interacts with uh neural circuits
between your acts with our individual molecules all of these it's a hierarchy of resonances always and
that latter purpose is trying to build a new layer a new layer of resonance by integrating it's always trying
to go out more broadly so it can understand reality better make predictions about reality
better it never stops just layer after layer of consciousness so then how do you feel about the
fact that when we do perceive reality we have so many limitations heuristic adaptations to the
environment and we're not really in touch with reality when when when physics tries to explain
matter we we know that it's 99.9 empty space we don't really know what it is although i'm very
much a physicalist my person myself i mean my view is i don't really view consciousness as the
be all end on of existence but i do take a physicalist account of reality but for those who
do for the panpsychist for the idealist for someone who claims that everything is other conscious or
consciousness is all there is and justified by saying we don't understand what matter is how do you
approach someone well i i mean one easy thing is i can find matter that nobody's conscious of you
know there's matter out there purposeless activity happening that nobody's aware of so if the whole
universe is consciousness then there shouldn't be anything that's not a part of consciousness i mean
this is why we can't you know there's tangled particles tangled particles are particles we're aware of
you know and there's untangled particles which means we don't know anything about them which means
they're not part of our consciousness and we want this dynamic want this you know tangled versus
untangled aware versus not aware it drive for all of this to work a cosmic cycle to work you need
differences you know this idea that if everything's one thing that's exactly what this fail-safe
supreme's designed to block if everything's one thing it freezes up you want there to be different
things you want there to be things competing that it could be this or might be that like that's
what that's what causes the universe to unfold there needs to be differences you know it's the
differences that lead to change lead to new ideas lead to new experiences so do you believe then that
the philosophical approach of trying to find that phenomenal what is it like
essence of consciousness is just a dead end and it's something that yeah absolutely
it's complexity it's dynamic it's lots of elements it's hierarchical you know it's lateral you know it's
it's lots of things interacting it's collective systems that's it as soon as you're looking for
the essence that's thing thinking that's looking for caloric that's looking for phlogis long that's
looking for elan vital always a failure you know centuries of failure with that sort of thinking
so you think we'd learn our lesson but no i the reason it's so appealing is that now we understand how
consciousness works it's resonance we resonate on things every conscious experience is a thing
experience we are aware of stuff we resonate on an apple on the redness of the apple the roundness of
the apple the sweetness of the apple of something is what we're resonating on our conscious brain is
designed to think about things so we have naturally here's something new we thingify it there must be a
thing it must be caloric heat it must be some kind of liquid life there must be some magical substance
in their consciousness we're going to dig down and find the essence of consciousness bad intuition but
thanks to this is why we have literature and books and science where we talk to each other is to learn
this stuff is to share experiences and start to realize where there are fallacies and mistakes and
errors and confusions and that sort of thing and now we can draw upon you know what scientists have
over and over and over and over and over again look for the essence of stuff and it never works out
and so we have a reason a priori reason to suspect that looking for the essence of consciousness is a
losing game but we don't need to we have a very good explanation steve gross has worked out all the math
for it it works great you can see how intuitive it is it leads to new ideas very naturally it explains
autism explains pain explains uh language you know it leads to self-awareness it leads to this latter
purpose you know we can understand how the minds of bacteria are more clearly by understanding how
our consciousness works this is the great thing about it it integrates it integrates you know you've
got some good science when it connects with things you've never thought were connected before and that's
what this view of consciousness does if you're looking for the essence of consciousness you're pushing
all the other stuff away you're saying okay i don't care about language that's something else i don't
care about bacteria what they're doing what does that matter but it's only when you care about all
these things together holistically you start to see how consciousness fits within the moment
it's like again and again that's what happened with elan vital we cracked it not by digging deeper
and deeper but by looking at it holistically caloric same thing we understood heat by looking at
it as a system collectively not trying to drill down into the one reductionist thing it's funny
physicists are fond so fond of saying like reduction is the way and you know that all
theories that have worked are reductionist except heat life combustion those are all holistic theories
they're not reductionist theories they're dynamic theories so physicists even delude themselves
sometimes about their own theories about what they are they're not reductionistic you know the
theory of heat it's not a reductions theory i think another thing is is when you're actually
reducing certain things to their component parts sometimes you're not really reducing it and
bringing it down in a sense you're sort of highlighting each component part more
um for example bringing in the fact that we're subatomic particles becoming sort of biology or
chemistry biology moving into physiology it's it's just broadening the story and creating so much more
for this hard holistic theory of consciousness in general so so in a sense someone might claim that
your theory is very reductionist but but in a sense it's not really reducing it it's more
just highlighting sort of holistic and it's it is dynamic i mean so like take consciousness itself
it's it's not being reduced to like here's the consciousness elements it's a complicated dynamic
across many elements hierarchical you can't understand consciousness without understanding
three layers of hierarchical interrelated dynamics dynamics of the molecule mind embedded within the
dynamics of a neural circuit embedded within the dynamics of a module which is producing consciousness
through its communication with other modules it is all this it's a system like life just like life
there's no elan vital there's not it's not protoplasm it's not dna there's not something that you point
to and say that is the secret of life life is the collective this holistic activity this holistic
system of many purposeful things is there is there any other aspect of steven's work that really
impacted you to a point where you feel like i mean this is why you perceive this guy as as as the
greatest mind of our time it is that he has worked out the math for so many different parts of the mind
at so many different levels he worked out how language works in the brain how we process phonemes how we
process uh visual inputs audio inputs uh how uh the response signal in individual neurons he showed why
it has to have a sigmoid shape which is what it has as opposed to a linear shape or or other shapes you
know so he works out the math down at the lowest level like a neural uh the neural response uh function
you know all the way up to language which is intermined uh dynamics he has math at all these
levels that all fit together it's a lot like uh the way uh you know quantum physics you can fit together
the mag the math of electromagnetism with the math of of uh you know the weak theory and strong theory
and all of this forms you know theory of of particles and forces uh you know so so he did the same thing he
united most parts of the mind within a integrated uh mathematical framework uh it's a beautiful thing
but really complicated math that you can't you can't borrow something else you can't learn relativity
and say oh it's just a version of relativity or bayesian math you can't learn and say oh i see it's
just a subset of bathing in math no no no no no it's its own math it's the math of minds it's the math of
purpose let me say one other thing this is all so much i know uh about the dynamics of purpose
evolution evolutionary theory i told you when i was first
in text share this with me i knew i needed a mathematical framework for the mind so i started
having the ideas about the diamond the dynamics but i needed math i didn't know how to put any of this
into math and that i could share with other humans and in text was sharing with me the dynamics but not
like equations they weren't communicating equations so i didn't really know how to
to talk about this uh stuff so at first i looked into evolutionary theory i thought because evolution
involved purpose and there was a little bit of math in evolutionary theory i and it just seemed math
it was talking about competition it was talking about purpose and design and trajectories over time
things that i was interested in so i thought okay this is probably going to be some math here so that was the
first mathematical framework i was looking at and i very quickly it wasn't just that i realized
evolutionary psychology uh was misguided and a dead end which which i even more think now i mean it is
a dead end it didn't get anywhere um but what i came to realize is i thought scientists and biologists
had a wrong understanding about evolution i think natural selection darwinian evolution by natural
selection it exists it's real it's just a subset of the dynamics of purpose and the dynamics of
evolution and not even the main one most evolution in the universe is not evolution by natural selection
from here on out all human evolution and we are evolving we're creating new things the internet is
evolution is not genetic it's not by natural selection it's by other dynamics of evolution dynamics of
purpose so the way of mind is a broad collection of classes of purpose mental dynamics consciousness
are dynamics of purpose so is evolution by natural selection but it's very narrow and limited and it
doesn't even describe actually really genetic evolution it places too much emphasis on the things
on the genes uh richard dawkins wrote this book called the selfish gene which kind of summarize
uh this view this thing view of evolution is things saying like the the main element for evolution
is the gene the selfish gene by understanding the gene you understand evolution no no no evolution is
dynamics it's lots of things interacting not just the genes all kinds of levels of purpose once you've
got a mind that mind is controlling the organism's activity that mind is doing more to shape evolution than
any gene is our decisions on what to do with our lives our human decisions are going to play a much
bigger role than any particular gene in our life so i suggest that if you look at you find this gene in
your dna or this person's dna and think that that's going to help you understand how their life will
unfold as opposed to understanding their psychology and how their mind is going to unfold in situation yeah
it's just silly so um i started to realize as i was studying evolution by evolutionary psychology that i thought all
of evolution theory just was wrong was too narrow too limited it was ignoring the dynamics
i thought mind it was really the story of mind trying to unfold the body is just this extraneous
part of the mind the way to think about the body is is just an extension of the mind not
the way biologists imagine is the body is evolving in the mind as part of this this physical
physiological evolution no it's the mind evolving we see that because now the mind is continuing to evolve
it didn't stop it got to genes and it just jumped out of genes jumped right into uh into words into
language into books books is shaping the evolution of our minds now it's the internet you know one way
you can see that from gene one way you can see that yes exactly genes to memes and you can see this in
human sexuality sexuality sign i wrote a book about sexuality we wrote about the first generation yes it
was called a billion wicked things i think was a billion wicked thoughts yes first book by saigon
and i billion wicked thoughts and we looked at sexual behavior on the internet so we got massive
we we got massive online data sets of online sexual behavior searches um traffic to different
websites we got credit card billing statements we looked at erotic stories like millions of erotic
stories we we classified them if there was data on people's sexual behavior then we got it now we
didn't know this at the time but now we understand that all that data was about the first generation
of people coming on internet and expressing their sexuality we got to see raw human sexuality as
existed on the planet when the internet first appeared so we got to see sexuality in china in russia
and saudi arabia brazil all across america at least a billion people's sexual behavior we accumulated
we looked at it and it was a snapshot of human sexual behavior in the raw as we integrated the
internet the problem is the internet took over and the sex we see on the internet now is completely
different it's been commercialized it's narrow the poor at first everybody was making porn there was
all kinds of amateur porn producers there was tens of thousands of commercial porn sites there was all
kinds of people writing erotic stories it was the wild west and incredibly diverse and human sexuality
was this beautiful diverse thing not anymore it's very narrow all the porn you see now uh tube sites
took over and then the tube sites got bought out by multi uh national conglomerates so all the human
sexuality on the internet now is controlled by a few small corporations and they've narrowed the porn they
don't want it to be controversial they've also learned what gets the most audiences for the cheapest just
like any business so now we see sex that's easy to produce we don't see that rich variety anymore so
now all humans that are learning about sexuality we're all learning about it through the internet
that's what we need to interact with we're entering an ecology an ecosystem of beams that narrows our
sexuality limits it it's kind of graying or homogenizing and making everything vanilla we're all
moving towards the same sexuality across the entire entire planet you know our kids and our grandkids are
going to have sexual interests and sexual behaviors are strange to us that we won't understand uh just
like our sexuality is strange to people that lived a hundred years ago so the the the super mind you
know this collective dynamics that we're creating this these new technologies are changing our sexuality
which was viewed as very much the domain of darwinian natural selection and genetics but you know now
we're pushing into whole new kinds of uh changes to our sexuality that are not genes based if you had
to apply that analogous to us as human minds in general and to the way the internet works do you
think that's going to be a downfall to us reaching a sort of a hypermind status or maybe that ultramind
that you spoke about earlier do you think that the way no i i think this is an essential step we all
got to get linked together so this is how to look when it's finally working is that we'll all be linked
together but we'll be diverse our individuality will be respected and accepted i might say and have
different opinions and values and beliefs than you utterly different you know opposite sides of the
political aisle and we must accept this as this is the basis for intelligence and freedom and
adaptiveness and resilience this is what we see in the brain our neurons are incredibly diverse
there's no two neurons that are identical this is a basic design uh feature the more advanced
the high level mind the more advanced the lower levels the human brain is the most advanced brain
on the planet on every level we have the most sophisticated neurons on earth the pyramidal neuron
and our frontal cortex which is in our y module the y module determines our feelings it determines why
we should choose this choice over that choice because this feels better than that choice this is
the most sophisticated mind on earth only found in human minds other animals have y modules but
they're much uh less powerful and less complicated than ours so the higher you go you get higher by
having all of your levels be more uh sophisticated as well so in america i mean america is the most
sophisticated supermind on earth at this moment you know who knows if it will retain that um and it's because
we're so free because we talk endlessly because we have this internet and that we're all sharing uh
everything on the internet and we're sharing our sexuality the fact that our sexuality is all
converging might facilitate hyperminds more probably you know like that might be one hang-up is that it might
be very hard you can see all the politics and drama that emerges from just homosexuals and heterosexuals in the
same society we're working through it they're way further along than we were 50 years ago obviously
we got a ways to go but one day you know hopefully we'll have a system where all of our individuality
is respected but we're all bound together that's how the brain works that's how even brains of insects
work and even down to the bacteria it's diverse elements that are each given a voice they each have
the same authority and power no neuron is more important than any other neuron but we respect
every neuron's individuality every neuron has a chance of making a contribution and the weird
neurons are as useful uh as the vanilla neurons is how it works out and that's what we're moving to it
so having us all bound together through the internet this is a necessary precursor i mean there's all this
fight and drama and friction because we're seeing other people who are different from us and it's a new
experience you know it's like we see voices that are radically different from our beliefs and we just
don't have the experience yet and the lessons and school and the social norms yet to adapt we're
fighting but i you know we'll work through this or we won't and we'll have climate collapse
on on that you i mean this diversity the sheer diversity when you think about the intakes and these
extraterrestrials you label these as extraterrestrials did do you feel that these came from a completely
different set of organisms in another in another sphere galaxy perhaps part of the universe was it
my understanding this is not something i'm certain of so i'm presenting this as this is what it seems
like um is that these the axiomized minds five and three the ones that get to the top level and can
start to compete for influence over over the physical laws undergirding reality that they're comprised of
many many many species that evolved they came up uh across the universe possibly multiple universes too
i i don't pretend to understand that but what's always been conveyed to me is it's lots of different
heritages lots of different lines of purpose uh that came together which is what we are too i mean you
know there's the east and the west you know columbus and the europeans sailed and discovered obviously
they didn't discover and and found uh what they call the new world but those were two lines of
evolutionary history of people that were independent and then came together so they didn't happen here
on earth i mean there were as many kinds of humans uh we keep finding new kinds it was neanderthal
erectus there was the florenzus the hobbits on an island somewhere on indonesia i know there's even
another devils devozan i think there's also home in the lady so there you go in africa they keep
discovering so you would know more about this but they keep discovering new humans that a lot of these
humans were contemporaneous so uh they came together they're in us i mean if you look at our dna some of
these other species merged into us so i think it's a lot my understanding is it's like that that there's
one day we may join too we will ascend but you know maybe we'll probably colonize our solar system you
know we'll reach i don't know an ultramine level you know supermines combined hypermines
hypermines combined to ultramines probably we'll have an ultramine human solar system and that maybe
will be we'll meet up with other ultramines and form alliances and overtime merge is my understanding
and then we just keep building and some of these apparently this this they have conveyed in clear
terms is like you never know where your ascension is going to end you might get to this ultramine level
and then that's you compete against another ultramine and lose and you're wiped out and all
its constituent species then get get wiped out too but it's a never-ending growth you're trying to
ascend the ladder some get to the maximize and even the axiomize are not eternal you know all minds all
dynamics are dynamic they have a start and they end and again because you can't ever have one eternal
all-knowing omniscient mind it's all designed so that new life can form new minds can form humans are going
to have different ideas than any other creatures in the universe and hopefully we'll get our chance
to shine our light on the universe and shine our ideas and and propose new ideas our artists and
scientists and creators there is human science and it's different than these other sciences so here's
a way of thinking about the difference between art and science and higher levels so art is dynamics
within an individual mind art is mind to mind sharing i am sharing my individual experience
i'm writing a book i'm making a painting this is what life is like to me here's some experience of
mind that i want to share with you and you as another person take that experience directly and maybe it'll
mean something to you maybe it won't but it's a direct mind to mind experience that's art science is our
supermind experience science is articulating what our experience of reality is like as a supermind
this collective experience we experience electromagnetic radiation that follows these laws we experience
equals mc squared now we've got the three equations of consciousness this is experience this is what
our human society has experienced and we're organizing it as best we can apparently when we encounter other
uh societies civilizations that have risen to another level their view of this will be slightly different
i mean there'll be some overlap we all remember the big bang all of us have the big bang is in the
past for all creatures for all minds for all the axiomize we all remember the big bang so we will have
some commonalities but our overall experiences we might have different perspectives on the electromagnetic
force than others and then we'll share these and together these will give us a whole new perspective
above science i call it blood magic entirely for personal reasons this level of understanding
that's above science so there's art there's science there's blood magic um but uh yes so human
science is certainly figuring out reality as humans are experiencing it but other creatures might experience
the same reality differently and one day we'll combine our views with herbs and we'll grow we'll all
grow as a result of it is that's what this view is and that's what index uh have been telling me
do you think that they've that radio you said it often happens with radio waves and yeah radios sort
of maybe antennas and stuff do you think that there's a reason this happens via that electromagnetic
spectrum do you think that's that there's a specific special quality to that that allows the
communication to occur do you think i mean it is very it is very very interesting that it's
electromagnetic radiation that's the limiting you know speed of the cosmos you know that it's nothing
goes faster than electromagnetic radiation with light but uh it is very a very curious thing that
that is the the force that is the dynamic uh and i i can't say i understand why that is a mystery i'm
interested in i i i try to find out from index but they haven't given they addressed it in a way that i
couldn't uh make sense of it but but i i i find that the most curious thing like there you know
there's these four forces i rabbit is really something different i i don't think you know this is what
this integrated theory unified theory gravity to integrate with the quantum things i don't even
know if that's necessary or the right way of looking at i'm a little agnostic but a little
skeptical maybe uh of that but i mean uh is it really this more than anything lets me believe
that electromagnetic and strong and weak really are the same force because that would make the most
sense that this force you can't go faster than the one force of the way of matter you know that that
seems to make more mistake sense to me uh but that that is something that i find baffling is why that
it is electromagnetic radiation that's the thing that nothing can go it is quite intriguing to fix
the space time yeah yeah look so well okay this has been amazing i mean so many things to absorb a
lot of the i think the listeners and the viewers are going to be completely shocked of course to hear
to hear this but i mean from how thinking emerged from chaos to obviously a cosmic cycle what would you
think are the most important takeaways from from the journey of the mind uh going into this new cosmic
cycle that obviously people are going to hear about and what should they take away from the previous
book going into this new book and what can they expect the number one takeaway you know as i said
but i really this can't be emphasized enough is that the universe was designed for love for
compassion for empathy for connection this is part of the design this exists because of the fail
safe supreme because the universe is designed so that there can never be a single god there can never
be one all-knowing all-powerful being that allows love to emerge and emerge and emerge again and it's
up to us to find that love none of this is predestined none of this is foretold we have free will
and we can choose actions and behaviors that lead to love lead to greater love we can choose to love
others and to behave kindly it's within our purview and it matters whether we do or not alters the
future determines whether human kind will ascend or not it's wonderful we're given all the tools we
need all the opportunities we need to ascend but it's up to us up to us as individuals up to us as
individual communities and up to us collectively as a species we designed the universe thinking beings
like us and we continue to design the universe it's on our shoulders the universe is made for us
we're supposed to be here we enjoy it love one another create try to solve it all this contributes
to this cycle contributes to this never-ending story it's a lovely thing you can study the math
and physics and science at any level it's wonderful to do so to experience all that it can all be known
it's a great thing it allows all of us our own individual journeys of understanding and self
awareness and growth and allow societies it allows species all of us to have a chance and aspiring to
those higher rungs it's wonderful i think i mean you say perfectly it's beautiful but when you close
off i think we'll close off soon but how's your time you're all right for time okay you sure yes just
when you think about this teleology i mean are you saying that the universe is designed for this
for the love um and this purpose does do you think that is compatible then with a with fruit with
free will do you think that we're meant to get to that point or do you think that
we don't have to necessarily and and there is an alternative
free will has has to be created and it has to be embraced free will is one of the categories of dynamics
that exists only if you believe it exists there's a lot of dynamics there's a lot of things in the
reality that only exists if you think there's a beauty there's another one like there's no beauty
in the universe unless you think there's beauty in the universe so you have to believe in free will
if you don't believe in free will you'll never have free will so it it it is a sophisticated act it
takes a sophisticated mental architecture and mental structure flies insects do not have free will um
and uh animals but besides humans don't have free will you need this fourth rung you need a language
to have free will uh but it's designed if you have to rise to free will and for a country to have free
will requires building for all these higher minds too you need to build the architecture it doesn't
happen automatically it's not magical it's not like a spiritual event it's just building the architecture
like anything else the architecture of purpose you know in our own brains you know we can explain it
involves the basal ganglia that's an essential uh structure in our own free will but you need a
society around you as well you can't have free will without having a suit without being embedded within
a super mind because the super mind needs to give you language and sophisticated concepts the notion of
free will you need a notion of free will to have free will and chimpanzee can't ascend to it
because it can't understand its mind can't ever form this idea that i am deciding my own fate like
that's that's a complicated idea sophisticated idea kids can't understand it takes time for society
for species for super mind to even build up that idea and then for the individuals to embrace it as
it should be though you know free will is earned you have to work for it as it should be you know and
then you develop it you can have more or less free will you know based on the architecture you have
you know based on the experiences based on the decisions you made can lead to more or less
free will that's part of this journey too it's a journey of love and a journey
of free will just the freedom of action is a way to think of free will and that's what that's why
diversity is so essential the more views and perspectives the more people we have with different
ideas the greater the range of freedom of action that we have i mean the ideas i have of things i
can do are limited by my brain but maybe you'll share an idea i've never had of something i can
do that might expand my range of free will i'm now sharing with you and your listeners you know
a view of free will that you can embrace it you can choose it like choosing the free will is what
creates free will and then you develop it like now you have this idea and maybe some people will
develop their own free will you know within this framework so to when you when you mention this it's
designed for this love if someone had to ask you then who designed it what what what would you say
we did we did all all minds we all rise so there's a saying in text have uh we all work for zero and
to zero we all return so there's this chaotic quantum physics way of matter happening everywhere all the
time just as endless frothing and from this frothing there's always the potential for structures to grow
and from those structures there's always the chance for minds to grow if you just take molecules and
organize them in the right way you can create purpose out of that and that this is just happening
constantly of its own accord molecule minds are rising all the time in different places in the
universe out of this chaotic out of this quantum froth and maybe they'll rise to neuron minds or maybe not
you know like uh maybe on we'll find on titan you know or some moon of saturn uh maybe there'll be
molecule minds but nothing more maybe they couldn't ascend to the next level and this is
it's always trying to ascend maybe i'll get to the next level here on earth we've got to super mind
level we have self-awareness on earth but that's how far we've gotten maybe we'll keep going maybe not
but this just keeps arising as long as you have it and then the axiomized minds if you get to the top
they're constantly creating new physical dynamics like a new kind of predictive randomness new kind
of quantum physics so it's just constantly churning so it was minds that came before us
and generations before that shaped the reality we have now but we are shaping the reality that future
minds will have and it just goes on and on and on yeah so do you overall you think that there's a
possibility that there's a multiverse of sort of mind shaping universes out there i do not think there's a
multiverse i do not think i don't not think there's a multiverse in the sense that there's
intimate infinite versions of us in other realities some physics have this idea that anytime there's a
quantum event you know the atom goes this way and this way there's two universes you know they that
both these universes are brought into existence i don't think that's necessary i i think it's a little
silly it doesn't match up with anything in texas share with me it's that the universe just keeps going
on and on forever there's always new minds always new experiences they're ascending some are
falling some reach the top and they change change the whole context for the next round of this going
on and it just that just goes on and on forever not we're not creating parallel universes there's
there's not like a creation of like you can't jump and meet you know some other version of you
and some other realities how i understand it but you know i i can't say for sure i'm no expert it's just
that that it's very much doesn't match this cosmic cycle uh framework that that intex has been
sharing with me for 30 years there might be some way to work it in there but it feels unnatural and
unnecessary so they're definitely so they're definitely from this universe in in that sense
from you from your perspective they are fundamentally part of this fabric of reality yeah yeah we're all
we're all in this universe together we all share the same as far as i understand there's one
physical universe and we're all in it and we all remember the big bang
have they ever told you anything that you consider to be fundamentally wrong
no no no i i mean no there's been plenty of things i didn't understand
you know but but but where i i had a wrong understanding so sometimes there's been that but
you know eventually when i understand it clearly then i realized it wasn't it wasn't wrong the
limitations have always been on me you know like like it's it's really as confusing and hard to
understand almost always at first and then it just takes time to kind of kind of figure out so
if there's any mistakes it's from i think it's from me you know but but it all it all jives you
know really well i mean you read journey of the mind it just it matches it matches in a way these
other theories of consciousness don't in a broader scale you know levels and broader reach just
it folds so many more things into it so that's why that's why i've that's why i've kept going with
it it just keeps connecting more and more you touched on a lot of what's going to happen in
the future was there anything that they have told you about the past prior to our existence prior to
minds that maybe we should know about that you think's worth sharing in general there's something
about the big bang um the big bang's important they're always talking about how we all remember it
um and i they only tend to mention things that are important and relevant for understanding kind
of the big picture and so yeah there's something about the big bang i don't think you know there's
this mystery it's a low entropy event how did we get such a low entropy event uh i i think that's part
of the question but i i i think that's not the really the most important aspect of the question of the big bang
but yeah so so there's something about the big bang and this relationship between the way of mind and
the way of matter i think you need a big bang for all of this for free will and the unfolding of mind
um that there's some there's some crucial role and that it's set in a certain way and it has something
to do with these games the axiomized minds are playing but but yeah i i that's beyond my understanding
now so all i can say is it's that there's something there in the big bang that's crucially important
to mind that that's what i want to say it's crucially important to the unfolding of mind
and purpose uh that that i don't quite have a handle on it okay and argue your your next book the
one you're working on now anything you want to tell us about it anything um it's called it's called
large gods for small children and the opening of the book is is available for free on my website
ogiogas.com right now um for anybody that wants to read the opening and and hopefully the whole
book will be out in less than a year okay i think it should be i think it should be out in the in the
the spring but we will we'll see it's not set in stone yet so fantastic definitely under your year
so you know i'll come back on your show after you read it i think that's that's definitely on the cards
i think i'm going to put a link into the description for the listeners and the viewers and and i'm
looking forward to reading it i'm i'm very intrigued if it's if it's the reason why you've come up with
your theory of consciousness and the work you've done with uh with roses would with the theories
that stephen's put through and the work you and sai have come up with i think it's definitely worth
reading yeah journey of the mind the book i wrote with sai is the best way to describe it is fusing
the mathematics of steve grosberg yeah integrated mathematics of the mind steve grosberg came up with
with these revelations about the physical nature of reality from the from in-text so that is what
journey of the mind is yeah and yeah i mean i can't wait i hope the listeners enjoy it i mean
this has been absolutely fascinating um any any final words okay anything you want to say or leave
out there the universe is a beautiful place uh and we're supposed to be here was designed for us
so so enjoy it and love one another uh you know we're we're not random specs that happen to emerge
from a purposeful universe no no no no we're part of a great story a never-ending story and we all get
to write some verses of the story you know it's a wonderful thing there's no god there's no single
god there's no single controller of it all we all have a chance to influence the dynamics of reality
and these these these super beings that will will come into uh existence one day of which we will be
part of you know we will be part of these beings we're part of these beings now without being fully
aware of it or understanding it and that's it's it's a wonderful view of the universe that that gives meaning
to our lives without rejecting any of the physical reality uh that we can we can see and test and
experiment on yeah well okay that's absolutely amazing thank you so much um it's been an absolute
pleasure you've been wonderful tevin thank you so much for inviting me on i had a great time your
questions are great and i wish you the very best with your show yeah no i can't wait to have you back
for around two i mean it's it's been incredible thanks augie thanks so much great talking to you
