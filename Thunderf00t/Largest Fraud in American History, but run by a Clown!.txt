Enron was one of the biggest frauds in American business history
But if you ever wondered what would it have looked like if it were ten times bigger and run by a clown
Go back and forth mate
If to solve sustainable energy we have to have a pickup truck
So I present to you the cyber truck so I can go right
And
To prove that wrong I'm going to put my finger completely flat against the cyber truck this time you believe in elan or you don't
This is it. This is where you got to throw down finger flat right here and see what happens ready ready ready
It it really is
the most
I think it's I think it's our best product. Okay. I can't even move my finger right now
I might have actually broken it. Look at how bad that puncture is and I
One thing I am confident of saying is that it's an incredible product
It's a whole of famer
I think plagued with a very serious issue where the accelerator pedal can come off
And get lodged up in the floorboard causing the vehicle to be pressed down to 100 acceleration
So it looks like
full here
and the bolt
Just came undone just vibrated out at here at tesla. We have the finest in apocalypse technology
Went all the way here and now it's
totally bent right there
All bent up
How tough is your truck?
It's crazy. The question is how do
happen
How does it happen at this point? I think I know
More about manufacturing than anyone currently alive on earth or france. Could you try to break this glass, please?
Well
Maybe that was a little too hard. I would literally take a bullet for elan
What elan is doing is more important for the future of my children knowing what anything i'm doing
Man it didn't go through
Elan is doing more for the planet than than more for my children just for what he's doing
He's doing more for my children than I am it can obliterate a child's arm
We have a we have a car here that experts said was impossible
That experts said would never be made
You're looking at the company and you look at all the improvements that are happening
You know when people say, oh, you know everything's on fire like well, what am I missing?
They're things are going really well. I I don't know if you're watching what the company does
Yeah, I mean we dug our own grave with cyber cyber truck, you know
I think it's I think it's our best product every big dig sort grave better than themself
Cyber truck the hundred thousand dollar truck whose warranty can be voided if you take it to a car wash
And don't put it in car wash mode or a truck that uh, you shouldn't um
Wash in the sunlight, which is maybe why the delivery event was conducted at night make sure that
That you that whatever you're doing is a great product of service
It has to be really great
I turned off road mode on while parked in a parking lot after a few minutes
I heard a pop and the suspension lowered. I couldn't even off road in a parking lot
But if you're entering anything where there's an existing marketplace against large entrenched competitors
Trucks have been the same for a very long time
Like a hundred years
Your product or service needs to be much better than theirs. It can't be a little bit better
Tesla is saying it will take a month to fix
Please help only had the cyber truck for a week had the cyber truck for four days
And then this part blew off on the highway and I can't find it on the way home after purchasing my cyber truck the window cracked
It looks like a manufacturing defect yet. The service center wants to charge me
$2,300 a flag staff charger was having issues staying on and now it bricked my cyber truck can't get in no power
Because then you put yourself in the shoes of the consumer and they say why would you buy it as a consumer?
You're always going to buy the trusted brand unless there's a big difference
Wait, there's more this one was completely bricked after four days of ownership
This one broke down after driving off the lot and driving only 35 miles
And then had to be picked up and towed back to the service center day one and I already need a new high voltage battery
So a lot of times
Entrepreneur will come up with something which is only slightly better
And it's it's not you can't just be slightly better. It's got to be a lot better
So I hear you ask
How is this going to end up 10 times worse than Enron?
Which was at the time the largest bankruptcy in american history made possible by one of the biggest
Accounting frauds in american history reading from the wiki page on the elon scandal
With poor financial reporting. They were able to hide billions of dollars of debt from fatal deals and projects
And the second massacre that he said
Hold my ketamine
But I can't say it's we're going to move to just truly massive scale
Scale that
No company has ever achieved in in the history of humanity
You see the first sign of our death rose from a company is when the people
In charge of it the people who know what it's really like under the hood
Not a sugar pie and candy public image when they start trying to take as much out of the company
It's not about how much stock you have
It's about how much copper wire you can get out of the building with guys
When they start trying to take as much out of the company as they can before everyone else realizes
It's worthless and you're selling something that you know has no value
We are selling to willing buyers of the current fair market price
Like robin denholm technically the head of tesla who sold some 50 million dollars of tesla stock this year
You know when tesla is almost at record low stock price
You know because why would y'all under stock it it's a record low if you still know it's got a long way to fall
Yet and just so we clear on scale nron went from being one of the most profitable energy companies around to being worth
Essentially zero in about six months losing around 70 billion dollars of market cap tesla has already lost
10 times that amount from its peak to its value now
And that's when the chair of the company decides that was a really good time to start off loading tesla stock
Yeah
Kind of like they know something or the vice president who quit and believed so much in the stock that he cashed out
Every single tesla stock that he had for some 180 million dollars
Seems like someone knew that that wasn't a good place to have their money and
Invested and i'm thinking maybe i was way too generous when i said three years till bankruptcy for tesla
And what's this tesla under investigation for security and wire fraud in relation to an
Full self-driving relatively easy and like a model s and model x at this point
Uh can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person right now
So i've been i wrote software for like 15 years 20 years
I know what we need to solve to make full self-driving feature complete
I'm certain that we will get this done this year feature complete for full self-driving this year with certainty
This is something that we control and i've managed autopilot engineering directly every week in detail
So i'm i'm certain of this or finance person or something like that. I i'm an engineer. I do engineering
Ah the musk fans who laughed at me when i said
Last year that it would be less than five years till musk goes down as the guy who is single handedly responsible
for the greatest destruction of wealth
in history
Imagine how much it hurts me to use the word infallible. Oh come on nobody's in
All right, then he's not infallible. It's just that up to now. He has never failed
Yeah, i think i've earned the right to cover the titanic sinking it from this moment no matter what we do
Titanic will found her being the one who first called it when everything looked calm and musk was the
richest man in the world and all the musk fans were like
But this ship can't see she's made of iron sir. I assure you she can and now it looks like the finances have already hit the fan
And it's more like five years. They'll be lucky to make two
The rats are already fleeing the sinking ship and the the vetted smell of carrion is filling the air
But it all pales into insignificance compared to the guy who knows more about selling tesla stock than anyone
currently alive on earth
Elon musk who at the peak of the bubble cashed out some 40 billion dollars of tesla stock
That's just not something you do if you believe that the stock is going to be worth more in the future than it is now
You know, if you actually believed it was a good investment
Even more so saying his musk
personally gave his guarantee like that of was ever worth anything but
He gave his guarantee that he would never sell the stock billionaire entrepreneur elan musk puts his money where his mouth is
I am personally guaranteeing that value and standing behind that guarantee with all of my assets
Just like his money was the first in it would be the last
Out by which of course he meant he was going to sell more tesla stock than anyone in history
I'm personally guaranteeing that value and now things are going so badly at tesla that the layoffs have gone from looking like
10 percent to 20 percent and now they're laying off the entire
Supercharger team apparently because musk wanted to make a point about how serious he was at cost cutting
Well simultaneously asking for a bonus five times larger than the wages of the entire company put together
You know so they can give the guy who has sold more tesla stock than anyone in history
More tesla land fund dollars to sell
You know to anyone actually believes this monopoly money is real
But wait the woman who just offloaded 50 million dollars of tesla stock now has a video out saying to the rest of the stockholders
That they should approve musk's pay deal because musk can't sell these shares that they're giving him for at least
Five years elan is required to hold any shares acquired through the award for five additional years
After the option is exercised
Actually, let me just explain the weasel words here
Musk already pledged to the stockholders that just like his money was the first in it would be the last out
All of a sudden saying that he won't sell the new shares that they give him for at least five years
Seems a little bit suspect you see musk used to earn about 20 percent of tesla
And he sold about half of that now this pay deal is they want to give him another 10 percent of tesla
And his proof that he's serious is he won't sell new stuff that they've given him for five years
Meaning that he is free to sell the rest of his tesla stock whenever he wants
There we are
And did I mention that this impartial advice was bought to you by someone who is this year sold 50 million dollars of tesla stock
The five-year clock has not even started yet
Which means elan is incentivised to drive the same growth that we've seen over the past five years for many years to come
And for this musk wants
56 billion dollars just to her just to keep him interested and in an act of almost cartoonish
Villainry, this is after musk cancelled the merit-based awards for everyone else at the company
Wow seems like musk doesn't think that workers can be
Incentivised by a a bonus, but not him of course now for musk
It's only the little people for who equality is a crucial part of workers pay
He's still once he is 50 sick a billion dollar bonus because that's the only thing that could motivate him
And what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good while doing evil
them
Okay, hey tesla. Here's a thought we're not just fire one guy
Now hear me out here
Rather than giving a bonus larger than the salaries of all the employees put together to motivate one person
Why don't we fire that one person and then try and motivate the rest of the company by splitting that bonus up among them?
Maybe equally because as musk said equality is a crucial part of workers pay
Comrade such that now your average tesla employee would get something like I know
50 a hundred thousand dollars base salary, whatever they're getting in the moment
Then they would get an optional half million dollar
stock bonus to her help motivate them
That seems like a fairly hefty incentive for the workforce
All for firing one guy who clearly doesn't believe in the company
and whilst there are some signs that some of the stockholders are waking up and sort of
Realising just how stupid this
Pay packages you also have to appreciate for a large number of tesla shareholders tesla isn't so much of a meme stock as it is
A cult but seriously like
I will throw myself in in front of anything for elan. I am a true believer you believe in elan or you don't
This is it. This is where you got to throw down
You either support elan or you don't don't half-ass it and with the test of stock currently at about 170 dollars and
Falling what does this guy think it's actually worth?
They are what do I think the stock is worth today?
Which my number is way over a thousand dollars a share you get to four thousand dollars here
Has it overshot what I think the stock is worth today?
Because I think it's going to ten thousand dollars a share down the road, right?
So he sat there looking at either tesla land fund bucks and imagining what if it was worth
500 percent more than delusional crazies like me will pay for it
Oh, but no, what if it's what if it's even 10 times higher than that?
Yeah, this is taking you to start a little bit more seriously than a
meme stock
But the simple reality is musk might have already
Fatally wounded tesla you see the word decimate comes from an old roman army punishment for disobedience where the
Disobedient group was ordered to kill 10 percent of their own as a punishment
Now a fat man can lose 10 percent of his weight perfectly fine by
Carefully dieting. However, if he elects to lose 10 percent of his weight by cutting off his head
He won't be so fine
Musk's plan for reducing the workforce seems to have been absent plan
And then to make matters worse. He just randomly decapitated one of the company's biggest selling points
Looks like tesla has eliminated as he said almost its entire supercharger team
It's a 500 strong team in charge of rolling out at the supercharger network across the u.s
Including its senior director rebecca tenucci. Shall we decimate them?
That sounds good nice word
Decimate these are on top of the 10 percent
company-wide staff cuts that musk ordered up last
Month and then having done that has proceeded to say okay. Let's decimate the company again
Remove 110
And he's still not finished companies that actually make stuff can't just do this
It takes time to get the right people into the right job with the right knowledge base and training
For example, john is not an extremely hardcore worker
But does know how to fix a mcguffin in the factory john is fired for not being
Extremely hardcore enough and the uh mcguffin breaks
And no one can fix the mcguffin causing millions of dollars of damage because the noise to fix the mcguffin has been lost from the company
musk's beast mode might have already put tesla into a
Decapitated chicken mode the company might already be the walking dead from this alone
And all that's really left is for the body to stop twitching
So where does that need this turn into a fraud and uh enron musk on curiously
This week one of the founders of facebook actually said that tesla was going down
Like enron and that they've mislead consumers on a massive scale lying about full self-driving
Inflating the range of their vehicles and uh
Unconfirmed that they inflated odometers, you know, probably to make the vehicles sound more reliable or something
Many times now security fraud he said now, of course musk was straight on top of the numbers to say disciplined
Professional and published a detailed response debunking all of the accusations now he posted this meme
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the ceo and cto of the company responsible for building the spacecraft
To take americans from lunar orbit and land them on the surface of the moon
No, no, he's working really hard because I have to triage the the things that I do at each company
And constantly think about what is the most useful thing that I could that I could do
Okay
Now the same thing but you're looking at a solar eclipse
Oh, that's good. That's spot on there. Now. Can you just give us the expression when you're looking down like on the
Little people you're firing while you're working out how many zeros to add to your own pay bonus
Oh, that's awesome Elon. I don't know how many hours you're practiced in front of the mirrors to knock it out of the park like that
But you did it. I triage the tasks and
Um, try to do the things that are most useful
Um, or where I most needed, you know, because they're going to be landing on the moon in the first quarter of
2024 and yes, if you check your watches that is actually in the past now
And thus far muskers created a rocket that can take zero tons
Not to the moon not to orbit but on a sub orbital trajectory
Which then spun out of control is entering the atmosphere
Backwards or um with the engines burning up like that or just upside down for instance
And what was SpaceX's edited reaction to all of this to a literally out-of-control spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere
upside down
I
Congratulations guys you did that that's in that's insane. I mean it looks like CGI
Um, I mean it's hard to believe that that is unfiltered video. That's just the actual what the camera saw. No filters. No nothing
That's actually what the camera saw, which is insane
So, you know
You're doing incredible work that I think
Almost no one thought would actually happen
so
It's wild that that this
Yeah, SpaceX has taken two out of three billion
taxpayer dollars for this contract and their head is hard at work
He has to really triage the task to think what's the best use of his time
But curiously he didn't threaten to sue the guy making these accusations
You know like what he was saying was demonstrably false or something
You see musk is a habit of filing frivolous anti-free speech lawsuits
Like against a non-profit that reported that since musk took over the platform
There'd been a rise in hate speech and he wanted to sue them six ways from sunday
Except the judge said nope
You are clearly only trying to sue these people to silence their free speech
But most telling out of all of this is when this guy says to musk this is now enron
musk's response is basically
Yeah
Kind of telling really wait till now that the department of justice and the security exchange commission is looking to tesla for
wire and securities fraud in relation to full self-driving
Yeah, I think he might have had a point. Look, you're allowed little flamboyance on salesmanship
What's the difference
Presentation
But when you're promising a hundred percent return on investment per year for your uh cyber taxi that is ready now
so the current cost of
model three robo taxi is
um
Less than 38 000 we expect that number to improve over time
You say what would be the probable gross profit from a single robo taxi?
um
We think probably something on the order of 30 000 dollars per year
You say what what does net person value of robo taxi?
Probably on the order of a couple hundred thousand dollars
You might have crossed that line, you know when you're promising 10 times the return of the largest Ponzi scheme in history
You might have crossed a line. I mean the claims are legion where he's claiming in 2020 that full self-driving was worth in excess of
100 000 dollars and that its price would only increase
They then proceeded to cut the price from 15 000 dollars to 12 000 and now to eight or you can subscribe to it for a
$100 per month
Still very few takers as the guy who said he would never settle an unjust case against them settled a full self-driving case
Where it was claimed that full self-driving killed the driver
This is definitely more like theranos, you know beta testing an unsafe product on the public relatively easy and
Like a model s and model x at this point
Uh can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person right now
It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement
Ed 209
Where glitches can end up in people dying
I'm sure it's only a glitch a temporary setback
You call this a glitch?
Yeah, it's now gotten so bad that the national highway transport safety association
Is taking legal steps to get all of the safety data off tesla
You have been notorious about releasing data that gives a
Selectively rosy picture. I mean it's easy to have your full self-driving be responsible for zero accidents
If it disengages one second before the crash and musk setting 2020 that there hadn't been a
Single person killed due to full self-driving in the first year of a full self-driving beta
To which reality call and said uh, nope. Yeah, when I said this is like enron, but run by a clown
Maybe I had the wrong sort of clown in mind. Maybe you think more like a
Transdimensional demonic space clown who feeds on fear
Play a game with me, would you
Just need really good AI. You just need really good intelligence
And you saw like all the extra sensors all the extra hardware all the extra cost to get the waymo to run
Tasty tasty beautiful
That was I was freaked. I was a little freaked out right there. I'm not going. Yeah, that wasn't good. Uh
Holy shit, what's going on?
Yeah full self-driving 99% of the time it doesn't try to kill you it just feeds on your fear
Oh
But this is just the musk theranos technology that can kill people
In terms of musk theranos technology that can't kill people
He's not theranos. He's serial theranos
You know theranos merely promised a miracle blood testing technology
Musk promises a miracle item like that every week
Musk did it with autopilot with robo taxis with flints water with across country summons with telepathic brain implants
With tunnels between washington and new york rocket technology submarines rocket thrusters on cars
rocket technology on tunneling machines rocket technology breaks rocket technology respirators
Rocket technology battery swaps rocket landings on mars by 2018 a floating
super heavy class of spaceport for mars the moon and hypersonic trouble around the earth
solar roof tiles and now
Robots and he's always going to deliver a term
In a year maybe a year and three months if you've asked for a year just a little maybe a year maybe a year and three months
Uh
But next year for sure
We'll have over a million robo taxis on the road
But if you wanted to prove it was fraud
Okay, that's pretty slum dunk case already
But if you wanted even more evidence that it was fraud like say for instance if you had the head of full self-driving at the time saying that
In 2017 full self-driving could barely keep the lane
Roughly five years at tesla when I joined it barely kept lane
On the highway
I think going up from palo Alto to sf was like three or four interventions anytime the
Road would do anything geometrically or turn too much. It would just like not work
And at the same time mask was saying this or december of this year
We should be able to go from yeah all the way from a parking lot in
California to a parking lot in new york
No controls touched at any point during the entire journey
But stunningly that's still not the
Clearest case of fraud against tesla. Take a look at the roadster
They took a thousand founder series orders for a quarter of a million dollars each
That is they took in
250 million dollars in 2017 for a car that they said they were making now
It's though it was this the foundation the whole company was the tesla roadster people who asked us for a long time
When are you gonna make a new roadster? We are making it now
And here we are in 2024 and there is still no sign of the car
I mean really is there anywhere where you can just take quarter of a billion dollars of people for a product
You claim you're making now and deliver nothing and not get prosecuted for fraud
But it's worse than that the product that they were promising was just pure vaporware
It couldn't be made then and it can't be made now
In that the battery that they were promising was what 200 kilowatt hours
This is gonna have a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack
So let's see give or take twice the size of the cybertruck battery pack which weighs about 700 kilos
So the battery alone on this thing is going to be about one and a half
Tons about the weight of an suv
So this small compact sports car that's going to have amazing acceleration and range and all that sort of thing
Has to carry the weight of about a Subaru Forester for the battery alone
606 this is these numbers sound naughty, but they're real
No, they're not these were completely made up stats
Presumably some us could take in a quarter of a billion dollars for orders that they would have known the company had zero
Chance of delivering, you know because our physics
uh, so um
Wire fraud that's really not like n-ron. That's definitely much more like theranos
So this guy saying it's n-ron, you know n-ron being an energy company that was for a while a perfectly respectable
energy company that just found out that it was a damn sight easier to
Lie about being profitable than actually being a profitable business
Is tesla lying about being profitable? Well, this guy certainly thinks so and musk had no credible
Comeback to it
But for me when I smell a rat is when I have clear evidence that the company is being
Outrageously and deliberately misleading in the figures that it releases, which at this point is the straight-up
Expectation for any company headed by musk, which if you're going to be honest have just been one
Giant string of bullshit claims
At that point, why wouldn't you expect them to lie about the financials as well? So a simple example
They started delivering the cybertruck in december of 2023 and about five months later
They recalled every single truck that they'd ever made which turned out to be just under 4 000
So that's a production rate of about a less than a thousand per month
But yet in that same quarter
They had a shareholder call where they claimed that they'd reached a thousand trucks per week. Thank you
The next question is what is the progress of cybertruck rounds?
Uh, I can take that one too cybertruck at 1k a week. Uh, just a couple weeks ago
Huh, so they claimed they're putting out a thousand a week
But still only managed to put out 4 000 in 20 weeks
And that's nothing in the media that came with the conference call
In big bold letters. It says production capacity of cybertruck is 125 000 per year
So what 2 000 a week? Oh, but wait, what's that in the comically hard to read ghost print at the bottom?
Installed capacity isn't current production rate. Ah, blah blah blah
So why report this in big bold letters if it's basically a useless number?
Why don't I just tell people how many you're actually producing? You know, this seems just kind of a
deliberately
And for me, yeah, if you're going to casually and deliberately mislead your shareholders like that over things that are in practice
operationally insignificant, you know, like the cybertruck
I definitely wouldn't trust them on any of their big numbers. This stinks of enron
Fudging your numbers to make things sound better than they are
Which has actually been musk's modus operandi going all the way back to zip 2
Where they would just get a regular computer and put it in a big box
So musk could tell them how this was a super sophisticated computer
A trick which apparently barely fooled the venture capitalists
But this constant fudging of the numbers to make the company seem better than it actually is is almost pervasive at tesla
So if you come to the tesla website, you'll find that they advertise the price of their models
Say 63 thousand dollars for a model x apart from that's not actually the price that you would pay
The price that you would pay isn't 63 thousand dollars. It's 77 thousand dollars 78 some
14 thousand dollars more expensive than the advertised price
Why because there is this weird little checkbox which says include a federal tax credit of
Seven half thousand dollars and an estimated five-year gas saving of
Six and a half thousand dollars. So just to be clear how stupid what they're doing here is what they're doing is saying
Well, if you bought a gas car
Then you would have had to have paid this much extra in gas over the electricity you put in the tesla
So we can include that in the ticket price. Why five years?
Why not? I mean, it's just a random number that they basically subtracted off the price of their tesla
To make it sound like it's more competitive and just put that on their website as their default prices for their cars
But fine tesla if you want to play silly games like this
Let's play this game of how much a tesla will depreciate over a first year versus a stock standard gasoline powered car
Like say a honda civic which you can get for some 30 thousand dollars
And we'll lose about 10 of its value over a year or so
Four teslas now the company has purchased four teslas and the last tesla
We bought was a model three performance which we bought about a year ago and the plan even back then was to trade it in on the cyber truck
Yeah, um, so we put 16,000 miles on it fine
So let's creatively modified the ticket price of our honda civic to
Include the depreciation you would have suffered if you actually bought a tesla over some random period of time
Let's say one year. We paid
$57,000 for it. How much did tesla want to give us give to us on trade?
31,000 yeah, in other words half after a year after a year
We tesla was willing to give us a half the value of the car after a year
Which I also found insulting so we factor in the
$26,000 depreciation of the tesla versus the 3k depreciation of the honda civic
That's a $23,000 saving. Wow looks like civics can advertise themselves for
Two and six thousand dollars respectively if they were as creative in their advertised prices as tesla
We ended up selling that car for 36,500 on the open market
So tesla was you know well below the market value of the car
So essentially buying a car today is an investment in the future. You're essentially buying
You're buying the I think the most profound thing
Is that if you buy a tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating asset not a depreciating asset
So not only have they not delivered the truck not only were they going to you know short us on the value of the model 3
And not only are they you know not delivering what they said they were an original lever
But now to really add insult to injury. It seems like you know, they're delivering
Trucks to people who are you know behind us in line as opposed to in front of us in line
You look the best evidence that tesla
Is finished is the fact that the car company that has pitched itself as a car company for the last 20 years
Is trying really really really hard to convince people that it's not a car company
You know even though 90 something percent of their revenue comes from selling cars or charging them with the remaining 5% or so
Basically being batteries and solar installations for houses
Yeah, but nron mask is so nice and telegus that there are financial summaries are
Unaudited but really this not a car company really wants us to believe
They're going to train their ai that can't be trusted to drive a car across a car park
the
full soft driving computer essentially the the inference engine on the car
It kind of makes sense to put that on to a humanoid form
They're going to use that ai and teach it to work in a factory
Wow
Robot in a factory that's not something that was done like
15 years ago only much much much better
And all of this from a company that built a robot with two arms that can only ever use one of them
Actually, I think you'll find that this is because these things are just being driven by people in haptic suits
Which is why teslas demos to date have been massively staged like this
And there's never been a live demo of the robot actually doing something, you know
Like robotics companies you'd be doing for over a decade because
Guaranteed this thing cannot keep its balance
You push it and it'll fall over faster than the constipated old man
It's mimicking and it will just roll around helplessly on the floor
Incapable of doing anything the only thing that teslas got going for it here is the um
The pareidolia effect, you know that people see it behaving kind of like a human
Unsurprising is being controlled by a person in a haptic suit
But they they see that and they think that this therefore must be really advanced robotics
I guarantee you if this thing ever gets demoed live
It will be the quickest bursting of the bubble ever
But even ignoring that let's just say it magically all works perfectly somehow
Now all you need is a massive set of training data to train the AI on
So let's see the cars driving across the car lot millions of hours of training data wasn't enough
You know for a car where it controls a simple faster slower left and right and this is going to be a far more complicated problem than that
So what 10 people in haptic suits might be able to train this robot in what a few thousand years
The robots and robo taxis of 2024 are the million robo taxis that will be on the road by 2020
But next year for sure
We will have over a million robo taxis on the road and delivered nothing the roadster of 2017
Thousand kilometer range this will be the first time an electric vehicle
Breaks a thousand kilometers a production electric vehicle will travel more than a thousand kilometers on a single charge at highway speed
So
The point of doing this is to just give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars
And delivered nothing the tesla semi that could beat rail
We're confident that this is a product that is better in every way from a future standpoint that wins on economics against
Diesel trucks in a worst-case scenario and that
defeats rail
In a convoy scenario. Yeah, they truck did precisely none of those things the fake solar tiles
So that's what it looked like before now. That's um all solar
The fake battery swaps from 2012 but it took 90 sort of 90 seconds for a pack swap. So
So hopefully this this this is the hopefully this is what convinces people finally that electric cars are the future
Or the fake
Supercomputer from 2003
Bernie Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history for some 20 years and did so with the veneer of the successful
Calculating businessman before he ran out of money and the whole thing collapsed
Musk has gone with a different approach of being a clear vaporware salesman for some 20 years in a clown costume
Sorry, uh
Updated clown costume inflating the price of his nfts to stupid levels before cashing out
Only to turn around and ask his fans to give him more nfts to sell them and these cull aren't just they're still drinking the kool-aid
They're asking for more
Sooner rather than later the market will realize that tesla isn't a tech company
It's a tech fantasy company, which my finance friends assure me is significantly less valuable
So how does this end with musk firing is remaining employees with his infamous
heartfelt
Dear employee email from an underground bunker blaming them for not being hard core enough to fulfill his vision
and then just declare victory and
Bankruptcy it's going to be interesting to see how his greatest fans rationalize the fall of
Techno Ponzi rocket Jesus when the financial disaster he's caused is bigger than enron and bernie meadoff
Combined and that's today's video
If you enjoy these rather in-depth well research videos feel free to drop a thumbs up on it
Or if you really like them you can support this channel directly through patreon because honestly at this point
I think musk's just going to be lucky if he merely goes bankrupt and follows the illustrious steps of billionaire unicorn entrepreneurs like
elisabeth holmes sam bankman fread and trevor milton to spend
You know the best part of a decade in jail and if he's unlucky
It'll be more like burning meadoff where he's going to spend the best part of a century and a half in prison
What I can't say is we're going to move to just truly massive scale
Uh scale that uh, no company has uh ever achieved in in in the history of humanity
