Today, we have an awesome guest, the creator of Baggage Claim.
Welcome.
Hi.
Hi, Mark.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Good.
Thanks for having me.
Of course.
I love your channel.
And I find it so refreshing.
And on Baggage Claim, you talk about cultural issues, but you take a really nice philosophical
approach to them and, you know, it's so confusing.
We live in such a time of chaos.
And to hear your take has been just refreshing as the word that comes to mind.
Thank you so much.
And I feel the same way about after school.
I absolutely love your channel, consume everything.
And I've been very inspired by how you, you have these takes where you'll draw really
good parallels without actually mentioning the particular issues that you're talking
about.
And I think in that way, you make your videos so timeless and universal.
So that's actually really been inspiring me to, to be better at doing that.
Oh, well, thank you.
That means a lot, especially coming from you, great creator.
So yeah, before we, this video will come out right after our collaboration comes out.
So we can talk about that.
But first I'd love to hear about just what were you doing before you started your channel?
Sure.
For a better part of a decade, I've been working in the startup space and so doing something
completely else.
That's not really where I started.
I started off as an accountant and then slowly got entered into startups.
I was inspired by my brother to move up to the Bay Area.
I used to live in Los Angeles before that and then moved to the Bay Area and really
enjoyed that aspect of sort of learning on the job.
You know, at a startup, you kind of wear multiple hats, you have to do whatever it takes.
So I learned a lot, but I kept kind of missing something.
I kept feeling like there was a part of me that just kind of realized that I was not
really meant for the job.
In a lot of ways, I'm, I wasn't really enjoying it.
It felt very forced.
I was kind of forcing myself into this particular mold of being this big exec.
I had this, you know, big dreams of, of that I was going to be this big executive.
And the more I got into it, the more unhappy I became.
And so I finally sort of got to that point, I think around the 30 mark, I've heard a lot
of people share similar stories where you stop trying to force yourself into being something.
You finally just acknowledge what you are and what you could be if you stopped trying
to force things.
And I just reached that point and I said, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.
I was fantasizing about YouTube videos.
I was thinking a lot about, about, you know, I was thinking in video essay form.
And I said, okay, I think it's time.
I think it's time to, to leave all that.
And it was a good time because 2020 happened, you know, all the madness that happened with
2020.
And it was a good time to take a pause and step back because everybody was kind of separated
out anyway.
So there wasn't enough distraction of the world.
And that's when I came up with the concept of baggage claim.
And it, I was motivated by wanting to talk about issues, personal issues, professional
issues, psychological issues that people might have on an individual level, but also culturally,
what are things that we can't sort of see eye to eye on?
And where can we meet in the middle?
Because things were becoming more and more polarized, more and more people were getting
angry and angry and angry.
And being in, you know, I'm, I'm based in San Francisco.
So being in San Francisco, things just over the last 10 years just became so polarized.
And my opinions that I thought were perfectly acceptable before were suddenly completely
being ostracized, especially I had to be really, really quiet in professional settings, or
people were making assumptions about how I think politically, just based on the color
of my skin or my gender.
And so I found those instances very strange and I said, this is, this, this can't be the
future of our society.
We have to be headed in a better place.
And so, and that's what really inspired me to, to start thinking about, about what I
could be contributing to that conversation.
So you basically got so uncomfortable in that startup environment that it pushed you
to express your creativity.
That story really resonates with me because I have, I had a similar thing where you feel
like you're just a cog in a machine and you feel like you're not being able to be creative.
And that's kind of what people are put on earth to do is be creative.
And if you're not doing that, you, you just, you feel completely inauthentic and it's almost
like you have a psychological death.
And so now are you doing a baggage claim full time?
Yes.
And what you just, you know, what you said, I also found that so much of my work, because
I never really thought of myself as a very creative person.
Even though I used to write a lot of stories when I was a kid, I just didn't think of myself
like that.
And my role just became sort of babysitting a lot of people, making sure that they did
their job.
That kind of became my everyday job was, Hey, can you make sure that people meet their deadlines?
And I found that to be such a strange idea that there was no self-governance for a lot
of people and they would find reasons to justify not getting their work done.
And, and I was just going around chasing things down and, and people, people were very kind
about, you know, pushing this narrative that I'm, oh, I'm the woman who gets shit done.
You know, that was kind of the tagline under my slack was, you know, she gets shit done.
And, and yet I found, well, why, why am I doing that?
Is that really helping people at the end of the day?
Is that actually contributing anything positive?
I just felt like a, I just felt kind of like a fetcher of sorts.
So, you know, it's, it's what you're saying is that psychological death, because you're
actually not being as productive as you could be.
Well, you are definitely getting shit done on your channel.
Yeah.
Um, so I, I, I've been really hyper focused on the issues that you talk about on your
channel because, um, movies in particular seem to be at the center of the culture war
now.
And it seems like our, our modern movies have been overtaken by some sort of rot within.
And, uh, I've been really into channels like, uh, critical drinker and nerd Roddick and
your channel.
Um, and I'm curious to know like your answer is just why are modern movies failing to connect
with audiences?
I think honestly analyzing that question ends up answering a bigger question around what's
wrong with society in general.
Um, and it could be perfectly summed up with we are caught up in this pursuit of the overly
simplistic approach.
I think if you think about the appeal of going the simple route is because it's possible
today because of the advent of social media.
So if I have a particular opinion, if I take it online, I could put that out there and
immediately get likes, whatever that opinion might be.
So I can build up a reputation pretty easily by minimal effort and just say things that
are particularly popular or, you know, rile people up, whatever, whatever my, my base
level goal might be.
And that's sort of, that sort of thinking has really translated into movie making because
to make a good movie, it takes a lot of work.
It takes so much effort.
And this is something Chris Gore talks, talked about.
He and I were, you know, messaging back and forth about this a couple of weeks ago.
Um, and someone who wrote for his, for his website, film threat, um, talked about that
there's this perception that movie making is actually really simple and anyone can do
it.
It's a form of jealousy, but also this marginalization of the effort.
And there's not that realization that to put something together, that's a good narrative,
you know, good structure, good, a good heart to it, good dialogue, even takes a lot of
thought, takes a lot of experience, um, a lot of consternation, a lot of collaboration
to come up with something like that.
And that's not really the approach that modern, um, writers that have gotten into these writer
rooms because they meet certain diversity criteria.
They don't think like that.
And a lot of the identity politics is rooted around that belief, that ability is not really,
is not really something that can be achieved through effort.
Ability is inherent to your experience or, you know, your, the color of your skin.
So for example, and I was talking about this on NerdRotix channel last week, that there's
that belief that a woman who checks certain boxes has something really unique to say.
Cause if you, I don't know if you know, but Disney released a new chat, a new TV show
called Echo, and it's, it hits, it's like the intersectional gold mine, so to speak,
because the main character, Maya, is a woman, she's indigenous, she's deaf, and she is
an amputee.
So she just hits so many, you know, checked boxes that, uh, all the people have to sort
of step back and bow down and say, you know, this woman's going to offer us an understanding
that's going to be so unique that nobody's ever, you know, could, could even perceive
what she might have to say or if she, you know, if she can't speak, but represent.
And that is just such a falsehood of, of belief that we are all so individually unique.
It's that idea of saying like everybody's special and such a, and everybody has such
a unique thing to do.
The thing is everybody has value to add, but we are a lot more similar than we are different.
And what makes a story good is when it speaks to universal truths that hit close to home,
that can actually, you know, they, they actually get to your heart, not because you look a
certain way or you, you, you have a certain background, but it's because of the universal
human experience.
And this past weekend when I was watching, I was watching, uh, the behind the scenes
for Lord of the Rings, which is the greatest trilogy of all time created of all time.
And I love watching the behind the scenes more than even sometimes watching the movie.
I like watching the behind the scenes because it shows you the Herculean effort that a lot
of people put for better part of 10 years.
And if you look at the entire sort of like vast variety of like production and cast from
top to bottom, everybody pulled their soul into that, that piece of work.
And I love seeing that because that's what art takes.
As you know, you know, that's what art takes is that it takes almost everything out of
you for you to create something beautiful, something that a lot of people can identify
with.
And I don't mean identify in the identity perspective.
I mean from the humanist experience perspective.
And you see that, that, you know, Peter Jackson set the tone at the main push behind that
whole project.
And everyone followed suit, all the production people, all the artists, you know, they even
thought about the cultural significance of what it means to be from Rohan and how significant
horses would be and where, you know, farmland would be placed.
They thought about all those little details versus what would it be like for Gondor?
I mean, that's how much that they really put thought into that.
And it showed, even if you didn't catch every little detail, it showed in the project as
a whole and it transformed all of their lives that art and their, their willingness to engage
with that art transformed their lives, but it transformed so many millions and millions
of people watch that and continue and will continue forever to watch that and be transformed
for it by it.
And I don't enjoy that movie or that story because there's, you know, a brown girl who's
happens to be Indian and an immigrant and is, you know, has, has black hair and is nearsighted
is in that movie.
What value does that add to me?
You know, and it's a very, that's a very narcissistic perspective to say, I need the
hero that's accomplishing great things to look just like me.
That's such a, that's such a surface level way to engage with a movie, but that's what
modern movie makers really expect.
And what is that?
That's the easy thing to do and say, you should enjoy this movie because the heroine looks
like you and that's what the entire promotion for Echo was exactly that.
It was our main character is deaf, our main character is deaf is she's indigenous.
She's this.
She's body positive.
She's this.
It's just all these little things that are so easy to do is the main promotion of that
TV, of that TV show.
But the actual value that someone might be able to get to see a story that transcends
time, that transcends space, but speaks to that human experience of what does it take
to do something really hard?
Lord of the Rings, what does it take to do a really difficult task?
And how does it change you?
How does it, how does it, what does it mean to go up against evil?
And how can that evil touch your heart and almost destroy you, almost kill you in that
process?
I mean, that's the human story that a lot of people connect with.
And so I think that's really the problem is that there's not that willingness to do the
hard thing because there's a lack of recognition that, that it's even worth the doing.
It's like, just take the easier out.
Just go for representation.
And that's the, and there's a whole group of people that are reinforcing that perspective
amongst those writer rooms.
Wow.
You just said it all.
You just hit so many different things that I want to talk about.
Um, and I think at the core of it, the, the writing is, is really fallen off a cliff and
they don't have anything new to say.
They're not telling any new stories.
They're not speaking to these universal truths.
And perhaps that's why they're so focused on these materialistic identity things.
Because if you take that identity aspect away from it, what is it?
It's just an empty, there's nothing behind that.
So perhaps that's why they are pushing that so hard because that's the only new
thing they're bringing to the table.
Otherwise it's like, well, why are you making this movie that nobody asked for?
We're making it because the genitalia of the new care of the main character is
different.
That's why we have to remake this $300 million movie.
And it's like, okay, I guess if it's that important to you, I guess it's worth
remaking, but I love that you spoke about Lord of the Rings.
Cause that's my favorite movie by far.
And I think I've literally watched that same behind the scenes video and I
can't watch Lord of the Rings without pointing out, like, you don't want to
watch Lord of the Rings with me.
Cause I'm going to be like, Viggo Mortensen broke his foot in this scene, you
know, he broke his toe.
And that's the first thing I thought I was like, you know, I think the same thing.
Yeah.
Like, did you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Same way.
Lord of the Rings is, is so deep and so good.
It's such a, it's a symmetrical story.
You have like nine members of the fellowship and then you have these nine
Nazgul who are like the shadow side of them chasing them.
And then you have the good wizard and then you have the dark wizard.
And then you have like elves and dwarves that contradict each other.
And then the Urukaya, the orcs are like literally dark elves.
They are like dug up from the earth and they are elves.
So it's like, it's almost like a perfect symmetrical psychological mind, the story.
It's like, there's a dark side and there's a light side.
And without the dark side, what is the shire?
The shire is like nothing without the dark side.
But because the dark is so dark in that story, the good is so good, you know,
that the anti-hero defines the heroes.
And, um, I never thought about it that way, I never thought about it that way.
I never thought about the symmetry.
That's very interesting.
And so true.
I never looked at it that way.
Really good stories have great symmetry.
Like I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.
And that story is very similar because Walter White is sick and he's kind of
dying, he's on his way out, but at the same time, his wife is pregnant.
She's bringing life in.
So you have this nice symmetry to the story.
You have his son in the above world, which is the, his son with his wife.
And then he has his son in the dark world, which is Jesse.
It's, um, and then every character in the dark world has good qualities.
And every character in the above world has these dark qualities, like his
sister-in-law steals, you know, everybody does these like things that you're like,
wait, maybe they're not so good.
Maybe all the good people aren't so good.
And he's got this like shadow side that he taps into.
And whenever he does that, you're like, yes, come on, Walter.
Well, I, I didn't, I never looked at that.
That's, that's the thing I, you know, I, that's, that's amazing.
I love that.
I can see why then you appreciate these things even more, you know,
seeing the deep layers of everything.
Yes.
And, and like you were saying with, with modern movies, there, there
isn't really much thought to like the symmetry.
It's very one dimensional.
Like you see a white guy on the screen and you're like, okay, he's the bad guy.
All right.
And you don't get much more depth to that.
No, no, you don't.
And the, what you were saying, you know, you can see with the writing, the,
around the laziness of everything, you know, taking the easy route for everything.
And, um, one of the things that I hate that, that's kind of come along with
is the amount of cursing in, in every, every single, um, script.
Because so, you know, there are some comedians that'll say, you know,
I'm going to work clean.
Like Will Smith is one of them.
He always said that he was going to work clean.
I obviously broke that cursing, like crazy during the Oscar night.
Um, but he's, he's always been one of those people who says, like, I'm not going
to curse and, and I think with cursing, it's a very easy to convey anger by just
using certain four letter words.
Um, it takes a lot of effort to convey it otherwise.
And I think that's again, one of those things that really bothers me about like
every now, you know, new TV show has cursing in it.
Rather than actually working with the language, the English language to create,
create dialogue that's engaging and interesting and like gives you full
nuance of someone's character and feelings without having to rely on something
like that, which is what was nice about network TV in the past is that that's
what it kind of demanded.
It said, you can't curse.
So a lot of people with that limitation had to make sure that they were going
to be really good at, at their mastery of the English language.
And that's now without that limitation, people just kind of go with them, you
know, lowest denominator.
Again, I know that I sound like such a, such a, you know, buddy, daddy, saying
stuff like that, but I just really want to defend the English language.
Well, I completely agree with you because if you don't have a lot of cursing,
when, and you do have cursing, it, it really has weight to it, but I have seen
that where there's certain shows where they're saying the F word in every other
sentence and it's kind of like, it just becomes a filler word.
Yes.
I don't like the word like, you know.
Yeah.
It's in succession.
That's one of the reasons I couldn't get into succession is that every other
word was the F word.
And, uh, what I liked about, um, what was interesting about sex in the city was
that there's a, I mean gratuitous amount of, uh, you know, sex scenes and nudity
and all the stuff, but when it came to Sarah Jessica Parker's character, one
of the things she said, when they started working on that, she said, I know it's
HBO and we can do anything, but I feel like my character being a writer should
not be cursing all the time, that when she does curse, like you're saying, it adds
that weight to it because that's the point is that she's a writer.
She's, she should be good at communicating her emotions without having to devolve to
that or resolve to that resort.
Sorry.
That's the word I was trying to think of.
And so what those times that she would say, you know what, F him, that like hit
really hard because that's, that was atypical for her to say something like that.
You know, I, I am a big fan of that show.
You are has, and like you were saying before, um, it has universal truths.
So you don't have to look exactly like the people in the show to get it.
And the swearing aspect, I remember the first episode of that show had the best
writing of any show I've ever seen because she asked Mr.
Big, have you ever been in love?
And he says, abs a fucking Lutley.
And you, you're like, okay, this is not going to be a traditional romance show
because he just swore while talking about something that's very traditionally
romantic, but he just swore.
So this is not going to be that type of story.
Right.
I could go on on that show as well.
Yeah.
The writing for that show is really good.
It is incredibly good.
As good as that writing is, it's exactly the opposite when it comes to the reboot.
And just like that is so poorly written.
You can just see, yeah, you can just see sort of the evolution of, of writer rooms
just from that, because I think it's a lot of the same people still involved,
but you can just see how the situation has really changed and, and talent has sort
of devolved.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think that show got consumed by identity politics as well.
Yes.
Yes.
I mean, Mr.
Big technically is canceled.
Forget Chris Knoth, the actor who plays Mr.
Big, but Mr.
Big, the idea of Mr.
Big is unacceptable in, in today's world because, you know, he's, he, he is what
he represented everything that was emblematic of New York in the nineties,
right?
Extremely kind of bigger, larger than life, uh, you know, uh, very masculine,
very sort of has his own way to everything very intrans, intransigent, uh,
and extremely, uh, rich, which is like what the whole show is about.
The whole show is about consumerism, you know, essentially it's about shoes.
It's about all the best clothing.
I mean, that was so much about it, but also about trying to find love at a time
where New York was kind of past love, right?
Past romance.
And so it's, it's interesting because now they're trying to kind of, you know,
they, they participate in all that and now they're trying to prove that they've
evolved beyond all of it and, uh, you know, think that by killing off of a, a
character, an iconic character, they can kind of claim moral high ground.
Yeah.
I've noticed that there's been a decline of, of romance in media and just in
general, um, you can even look at like statistics with Gen Z.
Yes.
There's less romance, less children.
Um, yeah.
What, what do you think that's about less romance?
I think, so this is, this is actually kind of perfect to talk about because I've
been, uh, neck deep in this feminist video that I seem to be working on forever.
I started writing it in December and I'm finally, I think almost done with the
editing and, uh, what, as part of that, so the question I've been trying to answer
is like, how has feminism helped our society and how has it hurt it?
Because I think we tend to take, at least out in the open, people tend to take a
very sort of polarized view on everything.
Oh, feminism sucks or feminism is great.
What about the middle ground is kind of what I wanted to dive into.
And so as part of that, I've read a lot of the writings of, of feminist thinkers,
you know, across the 20th century.
And the one that I found that I found to be the strangest was this woman called,
uh, Shula myth Firestone.
And she, uh, you know, passed away recently in 2012, she, but in, in the 1970s,
she was quite active and she wrote this book called The Dialectic of Sex.
And in that she laid out what the future needed to look like, excuse me, needed
to look like in order for it to actually be fair for men and women.
And she was building on a lot of the ideas that previous, um, previous
feminists had, had come out with, but there were a couple of points that she made.
And one of them was around, um, around men and women just being indistinguishable,
uh, physically, that they should be indistinguishable, that you should not
be able to tell, um, the difference.
And that women should not be responsible for bearing children, uh, because
of the pain and anguish attached to that, and that, um, children should be
bought born in pods, little, little, you know, pods outside of women's bodies.
And that children should not even be raised by their genetic parents.
Um, so, and that, and that the nuclear family should be eradicated.
So there are all these ideas and this was pretty consistent with sort of other
thinkers. Yes, she pushed it even further, uh, by saying that women, you
know, should not bear children period, but there were a lot of feminist
thinkers before her, uh, starting from the sixties that were suggesting that
women should not engage in, in sort of motherhood and family and in
relationships with men, that that was the ultimate, um, feminist move was to
just reject any sort of relationship with men.
And many of them suggested then, okay, well, how do you
fix loneliness? Oh, it's like, oh, engage in lesbianism is was sort of the answer.
Um, so it's that whole idea that women are so much happier without men and men
are just useless and get rid of them.
And, you know, they're just responsible for the patriarchy and, and, uh, upend
the whole, whole, whole board by not even engaging with them.
So I think that sort of thinking has been making its way and trickling into
various parts of, of sort of the teachings that, that, you know, children
go through when they go, go through college, that they, they get indoctrinated
with this idea that it's men and it's women and we're against each other.
And, you know, there can be only one winner.
You know, you don't need to engage with the other side.
You don't need to compromise.
You don't need to find a way to work together.
You don't need to build partnerships with the other, other sex.
It's just, you know, it's going to be one winner and it's going to be women.
And I think as part of that, then you're seeing those types of thinkers, you
know, the, the, the sort of disciples of those, that sort of thinking, then
entering writer's room.
So any sort of modern writing is not about romance at all.
It's actually about domination.
So Captain Marvel has no love interest.
Her only marriage is because, you know, she's, um, she's, I think, made a
political alliance or something in the, in the new Marvel movie.
I don't know if you saw that the Marvels and yeah, oh, you probably saved
yourself some time and time and money.
I couldn't do it.
There was, uh, uh, uh, an extra scene.
I don't know why I'm forgetting the word that deleted scene.
There you go.
That, uh, nerd Roddick showed on his channel and, uh, in the deleted scene,
there was this like very inappropriate lesbian joke made by one character to
another who's underage.
So it's very obvious that that, all of that sort of perspective on just cut
men out is very strong within the writers and they're just trying to insert
it anywhere possible.
And so it's old fashioned to be in love with a man and want to form a good
partnership with him.
It's old fashioned.
It's anti feminist to do that.
It's anti woman to do that.
And you see that even, uh, surface up with that, uh, Rachel Zegler interview
where she says, um, you know, there's a big focus on her love story and she's
so sarcastic about it.
She's so irritated about it, despite she herself having a boyfriend that she
often talks about in references.
Uh, and she talks about how the prince could be completely cut from the story.
Right.
It's, it's for who cares about love when there's power to be had, right?
And that's one of those things that's very interesting is that that's what
feminists think of the patriarchy, that the patriarchy only cares about
power and they don't care about love.
Um, and that's their person.
That's the very, I think very, you know, we can dive into the patriarchy whenever,
but that's a very simple overly simplistic, uh, ex understanding of how men think.
And so that's, this is their counteraction to that and saying love is a distraction.
Love requires compromise.
It requires, uh, sacrifice.
Um, so why would an individual do that?
Especially if we're pushing for a very self first perspective in philosophy and life.
So instead we, we should say, F love, we should go and seek power and leadership.
Yikes.
Well, it seems like the actions are driven entirely by resentment.
You know, there's no, I've heard that you're either driven by gratitude or by resentment.
And I think it's very clear that the people creating these movies are driven by
resentment now.
It's like all about what power do they lack?
Or, you know, how they've been wronged.
And it all stems from, to me, it all stems from narcissism, because there's
two types of narcissism, there's the, the form where you think everybody's better
than you.
So you were entitled to what they have.
You, you need to be leveled out or you believe that you are better than everybody
else and you're entitled as well.
Like both, both views lead to entitlement and that you're better than, you know,
that you come first.
Yeah.
And so you see that in, in the way that the characters in these movies behave.
It's this resentful narcissism.
And I don't think it's really connecting with audiences anymore, because if
you're looking at the numbers, it's been like flop after flop after flop with
these huge budget films.
So they're going to either have to correct their mistakes.
So they're just going to, they're going to not be able to sustain this, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
And, um, I think they're going to keep going for some time because the thing
is wokeness and I know we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll touch on some of this stuff
of how it's going to sort of infected companies and cities later.
But wokeness is, is such a, such an infection in that once it enters certain
environments, it's very hard to argue against.
It's very hard to overthrow and because it's very easy for people who are
willing to play that woke game.
It's very easy for them to destroy other people's reputations by casting
aspersions on their character and calling them racist and bigoted.
And, and those sorts of, those sorts of, those sorts of terms really stick.
You know, you, you say that enough, enough people say it, um, you know, it's
very destructive on an individual level.
So why would someone sort of stand up to that?
And so you just need one or two bad actors from, from a wokeness side to
kind of overthrow an entire organization.
It's really not that, not that hard because we live in a polite society.
We don't want to offend, uh, we're not brutes.
So it's almost like the strengths, the greatest strengths of Western society
are getting turned on itself, so to speak.
And everything you're saying about the resentment aspect of it, you know, I
think one of the best stories I've ever written is Groundhog Day.
And I don't know if you've watched that movie, have you?
I have to know.
You, you, and I think you'll really, I think you'll really enjoy it.
And I, you know, without giving, well, I kind of don't want to give it away.
I'll still watch it.
Um, yeah, I don't want to get, I don't want to ruin the experience for you,
but it's not, I mean, I think you can anticipate what the movie might be
about the second you start watching it.
But the, what's great about that movie is first of all, the premises
that this man is waking up and reliving the same day over and over.
So you must have heard that part, uh, because it's some, it's like a fun
trope that he's literally replaying Groundhog Day every day.
And he has no idea why.
And when you meet the character, his name is Phil and, you know,
played really well by, uh, yeah.
Um, Marie, right?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm so glad you remembered his name.
And he, you know, played so well by him.
And when you meet him, he is this very resentful sort of narcissistic,
um, self aggrandizing type character.
And he's full of loathing.
I mean, for everything, for life, for the world, people around him,
his colleagues, uh, his job, everything.
And so you see him live two particular days before the repeating starts.
And when you see the second day that he lives, the one day that he keeps
repeating over and over, you realize it's actually a really shitty day
that he ends up living where he wakes up.
He's, you know, he's here in this town.
He's reporting on Groundhog Day and he wakes up.
He's at an, at a BNB, it's a cold day.
He's rude to the person he meets outside of his room.
He mocks him.
He goes downstairs.
He's rude to the, uh, BNB owner.
You know, she doesn't know what espresso is and he mocks her for that.
He, he walks out, he sees some old man and he's, who's asking for money
and he kind of mocks him as well.
He tries to avoid this insurance salesman that he runs into,
who's an old, old student from his own, own school.
He ends up getting, walking into a puddle, like a really cold, wet puddle.
And like, he's just having this terrible day and he comes, he gets to his job.
He reports on it.
Again, he's like sarcastically reporting on this job and, and you see him
play out this whole day and it's like, what, what entity forced him to
relive this day every, like for possibly years.
Like people estimate that that day he lived for maybe 10 years over and over
is what people think.
Like it's like thousands and thousands of times he's waking up,
but it's, it's that we experience his experience, we experience his life for
that one sliver of a day, but you can make that assumption
that that's how he was living every single day of his life leading up to that.
And the movie as it evolves forces him to rethink some things
because there's just no out of sheer, you know, lack of choice.
And suddenly he switches his perspective from being sort of the supercilious person
or even hedonistic person to suddenly he's like, let me see if I can help people.
Cause I'm here and I see what they're up to.
And suddenly he just starts helping people.
He helps the old man that he comes across.
He makes sure that he's warm and fed and he goes to,
he realizes that one kid across the block like broke his leg.
So he every time, you know, he's about to break his leg every day.
He's, he saves him and prevents him from breaking his leg.
Or like some old women get a flat tire and he goes and spends time on that.
And that's just him helping people around the town,
but he starts learning how to play the piano and he starts
learning how to ice sculpt and like he starts reading French poetry.
And there are all these little things he starts engaging in.
And then as a result, it actually completely changes his perspective on life.
And you, so you see from in the beginning, he lives this terrible, terrible day
to suddenly the last day you see, he lives this wondrous day
where he goes around reading everybody of their misery.
And you realize that nothing has changed.
It's not, it's like the day is exactly the same.
Life is exactly the same.
It's his perspective has changed, his effort into his life has changed.
His, how he thinks about other people has changed.
And he went from living this resentful, terrible life
to actually a very fulfilling, thoughtful life
where he's looked at by other people and respected by other people.
Whereas before people couldn't give a damn about him.
And the, the person who wrote this and the directors,
they both said that they received so many letters from across the globe saying,
this is the perfect Buddhist movie.
This is the perfect Hindu movie.
This is the perfect Jewish movie.
This is the perfect, you know, Christian movie
because they were talking about like what lessons that this, this movie was espousing.
And the reality is it's actually the perfect, it's perfect universally
because it conveys that basic idea that nothing you do in life is under your,
sorry, life in general, what happens to you is mostly not under your control.
It's what you, how you choose to engage with life that's really important.
And that idea is so universal that people across the globe are writing to him and saying,
this really spoke to me, you know, this completely connected with me and thank you.
And, and, and that's the point.
That's what makes a good story.
And that's what makes a story transcend time is if it, if it gets to the core of like
actually solving a very important question, which is how do you find a way
to live a really good life despite the endless miseries of life,
but also why then exploring why resentment is so attractive to it, to a lot of people.
And everybody goes through that, right?
You could be the most optimistic person possible.
And I'm, I'm a very optimistic person.
But for the last four years, I had a very trying time.
There were a lot of things that were happening in my life personally,
including health issues and like family issues and all the stuff that it,
I could see the door.
I could see the door open for me to walk through and become this very resentful person.
It's like that there's always that attraction,
but it takes that it takes work to stay on the optimistic side.
And that at the end of the day, it just benefits you.
You live a better life.
If you engage with an optimistic perspective versus, you know, a resentful sort of angry one.
Well, that's a beautiful analogy.
And I have so many thoughts.
And the saying I say all the time is fate is what you are given.
Destiny is what you make of it.
And I like that.
I think that speaks to two things are true at the same time.
You are a product of your environment,
but your environment is also a product of you.
So when people get drawn towards that victim mindset,
it's so attractive because it says, Hey, nothing's your fault.
You're just a product of your environment.
You didn't pick your genes or your parents or where you're born.
So none of this is your fault.
And you're like, Yes, thank you.
That that is true.
And it is true.
But what is also true at the same time is your environment is a product of you.
So you can enact free will and create the situation that you want to make it.
And it all starts within your own mind.
And that's kind of why we watch that movie Groundhog Day in the first place.
Because if it was just him reliving the same day every day,
and there was no evolution of his mindset,
why would we even watch it?
That's kind of why we watch movies is to see this hero's journey play out.
You know, they start in this resentful, bitter place like Thor or something.
And then they have to learn this important lesson.
And they come out on the other side, this evolved enlightened being.
And I think that's what modern movies are missing so much
is the characters don't develop.
And in so many of the scenes, nothing is lost and nothing is gained.
And you're kind of like sitting there, why did I even watch this?
Because it's almost like the producer said,
we need one more battle scene here.
And they just inserted it after the movie was already made.
And but, you know, nobody can die and nobody can get hurt.
So because it can impact the later scene.
Whereas you think of a good movie, Lord of the Rings,
every single battle, every line, every interaction,
something is lost and something is gained.
So you, you know, everything has weight to it.
Everything becomes important.
So yeah, that's, that's why we tune into these things to see that evolution.
Yeah, just a thought on what you said.
Absolutely.
Absolutely agree with you.
There's no, there's, yeah, there's, there are no stakes.
And that's what's interesting about Echo is that not only are there no stakes,
there are also no morals.
You know, she wants, she wants to replace the crime boss that she used to work for.
She's this assassin.
And she, you know, she realizes that this man kind of betrayed her.
So she goes and, you know, shoots him in the face.
And now she wants to be, you know, run the ring herself.
And there's no recognition that she's gone around killing people.
There are no consequences for that.
You know, there is no atonement for that.
She's not really a hero.
She's only so because you're being told that she is so.
There's no actual morality attached to it.
So that, and that's the other thing is that there's no sort of,
that everything's sort of murky on that side as well.
Well, yeah, that's, that's also a sign of good story writing because
the line between good and evil is not very simple.
You know, you can't just put all the oppressors on one side and all the oppressed on the other.
Um, the famous writer Alexander sultan is saying his name wrong,
but he was the Russian writer that was in a gulag.
He famously said that the line between good and evil runs between every human heart.
And this was very profound for him to say because he was at the mercy of
these communist soldiers in a gulag.
And he was able to even see the humanity in them.
And he was able to see that people that were right next to him in the camps were also
had evil qualities.
So it's like everybody with just a few different tweaks of your circumstances,
you could end up being that soldier at the gulag or you could be the prisoner, you know?
Yeah, it's not clear who's good and who's bad.
Right.
And I think, um, I think there was a lot of black and white perspective on,
you know, that could be achieved on the war when it came to world war two
because of this like mass imprisonment that happened of people.
But everything that's happened geopolitically since is so nuanced that people crave,
but people crave that black and white perspective is that they, they don't want to,
you know, and I, I do too.
I'm not, I'm not pinning it just on other people.
I too wish that I could just say that person's evil and, you know, our country is great.
And then that way I can just connect with our country's national identity and never have to
question it, you know?
And I can just feel safe in the national identity, but everything is so murky,
but people are often looking for that is that who's the bad guy and I want to be part of the
good guys and, and just leave it at that.
Very true.
I think there was a point in American history where we did think that we were the good guys
and we were absolutely sure that probably after world war two we were patting ourselves
on the back, but I think around Vietnam is when we realized actually we might be the bad guys.
And I think a lot of that American innocence was ripped away in the sixties.
Yes.
And I think one of the things that makes me really sad is it was really interesting to watch
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s podcast.
If you haven't watched his talk, by the way, on Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman, just incredible.
And he talks a lot about his father and his uncle and their assassinations.
And, but also how his father and his uncle really helped prevent the war escalation,
the Cold War escalation with, with Russia and the whole sort of machine kind of what
Eisenhower warned us about the, the complex industry, the military industrial complex.
There you go.
And the obsession with, with another, starting another war that there was this whole machine
trying to manipulate JFK into going to war.
And both RFK and JFK sort of coalesced and decided to try to de-escalate it by just connecting
with Gorbachev directly.
And I think RFK ended up writing a letter to Gorbachev and talking about the importance
of a future for their children and Gorbachev being a father himself really connected with that.
And RF, RFK Jr. tells the story much better than I could do it justice.
But what I found really sad about that is that here were two men that were thinking about
rather than their legacy, because they could have thought from the perspective of,
you know, being those presidents that are waging into war and, and, you know, recognize
as heroes and vanquishing the enemy, so to speak, and just cementing their legacy accordingly.
And all they could think about instead was, you know, the people that, you know, millions of
Russians will die, millions of Americans will die.
And that that's more important than any individual's legacy.
And knowing that these two men couldn't be sort of bamboozled into going into war.
And there were many attempts made to convince our JFK to send troops to Vietnam.
That was actually what RFK Jr. talked about, that his, his uncle was really resisting starting
a war with Vietnam. And that that's when the assassination happened, you know.
And after that, LBJ, the, the vice president got promoted and very quickly we went into Vietnam.
So you have to wonder sort of around that. I'm not making broad statements there,
but you just have to kind of wonder what exactly was going on there.
But that's so sad that, you know, these men looked at someone like JFK, who was essentially,
in that context, the best man among them, who was willing to think about greater good than,
than their, than his own selfish desires. And they decided to get together and, and, you know,
maybe get him out of the job. So that, and that's what happens, right?
You, it takes one man to stand up to something like that, to prevent something bad like that.
But that's, that's what moral degradation looks like, is that when good men are unable to,
to do anything to stop it, right? You don't, you have a room of, of like smoky cigars, just
driving, you know, very sort of narcissistic, like selfish desires forward versus thinking
about the bigger picture of things. Yeah, well, it seems like we're at a point where
the actions of our country, especially abroad globally, don't seem to be in the best interest
of the vast majority of citizens in America. It seems to be serving this very small elite group,
who is like this puppeteer pulling the strings. And we're sitting here like,
nobody really wants to go to war. I haven't really met a single person that was just like
gung ho about going to war. And it doesn't seem like we're getting much out of it.
And, but we're sending all these resources to other countries to keep this going. Yet,
when a tragedy happens in America, like in Hawaii, the citizens in Hawaii are kind of left
needing help. And, you know, they're American citizens. Where's their help? Well, it's not
really in the interest of these puppeteers. So, you know, they don't really get much from helping
the Hawaiian citizen. Absolutely. And I think this is where the self governance aspect has
really fallen apart in society. Like if you have to, if we have to wonder, you know, what exactly
is wrong with everything that's going on, it's, it's the, it's the fall of self governance because
laws and even constitutions, they don't, they don't actually implement anything. They, you know,
they, they set the tone, but it's like, it's, it's an agreement that the individuals have to
maintain it. Right. So what ends up maintaining a good society is culture. And what ends up
maintaining a good culture is self governance. And how much an individual is willing to do the
right thing. And so the culture reinforces that, and then the individual reinforces the culture.
And this is, you know, the, the, the common Nietzsche line is that we have, we have killed God,
right? And, and he predicted all the things that were to come that have, have happened in the 20th
century. And I think that's where we're really languishing as a society is that we don't know
what to do with ourselves post God. And we're seeing, we're very, we're very quick to reject
the idea of God and, and say, oh, that's such an antiquated idea of some man in the sky,
kind of like cartoonish perspective on God. But once we've destroyed him, we've actually
replaced him with ourselves. And that's a terrible on a, on a human level, that's actually terrible
for us. We, we should not think of ourselves on an individual level as the most sort of
the highest being to kind of abide by that what you do alone when no one is looking,
your, your selfish mind will say, that's fine, you can do whatever you want. If you have a
relationship with a higher power, you would say, no, what's the right thing to do? And that
conversation is completely lost. And so people, people kind of, people have become more and more
just out for themselves. It's like, I can do whatever I can, even if, you know, even if you
look at a very successful, unsuccessful CEO of a massive company, you know, who's getting fired
for a job, because his, his company is, you know, laying off people and doing really poorly. And
yet his, his, you know, exit package includes a $50 million bonus, right? There should not be a law
that says, hey, unsuccessful CEOs should not be paid. But on an individual level, if you're a
moral person who says, what about, what about this is right for me to take money for a job poorly
done? You know, and, and there's no that sort of that cultural reinforcement nor individual
reinforcement of doing right by society. And that's where we're at right now. So that's why so,
and then other people look at it and say, well, if other people are going to live for themselves,
and I'm going to live for myself. So everybody's just sort of bumping into each other, living for
themselves, trying to screw each other over. So, so we don't really know what to sort of,
who to answer to what to do. Everybody's like, just get out of my way. It's like individual first.
I don't know if I did the best job at explaining that, but
No, you did an amazing job there. You made me, I'm really glad you brought up that quote from
Nietzsche, because I've been looking into him a lot lately. And I think that's so relevant when
you look at what's happening in, in these like big urban cities, where there's a complete lack
of common belief system. They've killed God. And so there's nothing holding the people together.
And we like to think that we've got science now, and we're really enlightened. And we,
you know, science has given us all this convenience and comfort, but you can't get your morals from
science. You cannot get your principles from just dry facts. And I think that's what religion does.
You know, there's good and bad with everything, but one thing that religion does is it tells you
a code of morals to live by. And so when somebody falls in front of you and gets hurt,
you know, a religious text would say, you get down and you help that person.
So you know when that happens to do that. But if you don't have that core belief system, somebody
falls down in front of you, you can kind of just look at them and say, Oh, that's not my problem.
You know, there, if I help them, what would happen to me? You know, like,
it reminds me of the Good Samaritan idea and being a good neighbor. And
yeah, I look around cities now and I see a lot of godless behavior, a lot of lack of morals,
people are not, people don't say hello to each other. There's a lot of disconnection. And you see
it manifest in like people live impulsively, they go towards addiction and prostitution. And then on
the other side, you go to a temple or a very old ancient religious site, and there's pristine gardens
and it's quiet and it's been preserved for thousands of years. And you think, okay,
maybe there's something to this. And there's a philosophical concept called Chester's tins
fence, Chester tins fence. Have you heard of this? I have. Yeah. Well, just really quick. It's like
you come up on a fence and you don't know why it's there. You shouldn't destroy that fence until you
know its purpose. And that's kind of what religion is. Like we're coming up to religion and we're
saying, Oh, let's just destroy it. But we don't really know what its purpose is fully. And it's
been around for thousands of years. And it's, we need to be careful if we're just going to
toss it out. I heard a quote, it's there are two types of fools. Those who take religion literally
and those who believe it has no value. So I kind of that that quote really resonated because
I like that. I think you have to have your foot in both realms.
Yes, because on either side, there's a very dogmatic belief. You know, and
I'm going to say something. I'm sure it's going to upset a lot of people, but
you know, with the decline of religion could have been so massively avoided to
specifically Christianity in America, if Christians and Christian leaders were more
willing to accept people in, you know, in the gay and lesbian community and say to them, Okay,
this is, you know, sort of how you, you're born, you were born. And instead of rejecting you and
calling you immoral and telling you, you know, you're going to burn in hell, which is to say,
No, you know, come into the community, be who you are, but live morally,
settle down with a person, adopt a child or, you know, have a child by via some other, you know,
person, but live morally and live a nice fulfilling life. Come, come be a Christian.
Here's your path to being Christian. You know, and, and I know a lot of people that makes a
lot of Christians unhappy, that idea, because they said, Well, the Bible says this X, Y and Z.
There are a lot of things by both the Bible says that people don't want to live by people kind of,
it's like what you're saying is like you take it to literally, right? It's like the Bible also has
its own limitations. It was written at certain times. And so there should be a willingness to
understand when something is, is out of fashion, but can be evolved to meet modern requirements.
And what happened instead? So they rejected this, this huge community and told them that you are,
no matter what your immoral, no matter what, and completely turned them away, ostracized them
completely. And so they said, Okay, well, if I'm immoral anyway, why should I live a normal life?
You know, why should I try to engage with any of your rules? And they completely, they were
completely cast out into the wild. And I think that's so damaging for society, because we at
some point we had to reconcile with that fact is that some people are gay, some people are lesbian,
you have to reconcile with that fact. And, and that's the thing is that religion should,
should endeavor to be at the best version of people rather than the solid overly solidified
aspect. And same with, you know, I'm, I'm not Christian, I'm, I'm Hindu. It's the same with
Hinduism too. Hinduism, you know, has made many attempts to reject a lot of things. And
oh, women should do this and women should jump in the pyre of their dying husband. You know,
there are a lot of limiting things that religion do, they have to evolve. And I think that's where
we're kind of stuck is like the, you know, like all these old fashioned ideas that have persisted
for thousands of years, you know, why is marriage good, all of these things, they're being upended
today, because everybody's like willing to question everything. Let's question everything. And the
problem is that a lot of people don't know how to defend it. If, you know, it's like kind of like,
if a child keeps asking you why, why, why, why, why, why this, why that, why do I have to eat this,
why do I have to do that? And then the parent just goes eventually because I said so, you know,
and, and that's sort of what society was trying to do is like, well, you, why, why should I get
married? Everybody does it, just do it. And so that those, I think we became too, we came, we,
at a point that we're willing to question everything, we needed better answers. And I think
that's what your channel and you know, hopefully my channel, we're trying to do is we're trying to
answer these questions of, of sort of the old fashioned values, what value do they have to
the individual today, because they persisted, not because it's some nefarious plot to control the
individual, they persisted because they're actually good for the individual. And understanding that
so that people can understand why is marriage so good, why is monogamy so good? You know,
there's that whole idea of no, you know, human beings are meant to be meant to be,
you know, polygamous and that selling monogamy, that's a very Judeo-Christian old fashioned way
of controlling people, you know, that whole thing. And when that's not true at all, monogamy is actually
so good for individuals, and it's so good for children. And, and so understanding all of that
and explaining all of that is, I think that's the way we move forward is, is a non,
is without relying on, well, because God said so, that's why you have to do it,
instead actually giving a thoughtful action with a thoughtful answer without having to
kind of jump it up to the big man in the sky, as a, as to rely on his authority.
Yeah, that's, that was beautifully put. And I've come around to see that monogamy is
the best long-term strategy by far for raising families, for long-term happiness, for living
life. And it's the simplest, for sure. But I can see when you're young, it's hard to see that,
because you want to experience everything. And you, you know, it's like if you're a prisoner
in a cell, I'm like literally drawing this image right now, there's a prisoner in a cell,
and he can reach for the keys to open the cell, or he can reach for some food and get some food.
And, you know, the prisoners usually going to reach for the food. Well, the image shows him
reaching for the food, because it's like we want to reach for that, that instant gratification,
that pleasure, rather than seeing, okay, what's good for the long term. Yeah.
Yeah, you're so, that's, you're absolutely right. And I think as when you're young, you know,
you're impetuous enough, but that's also important to kind of explore. You don't know what you want,
you're not crystallized yet. It's good to have a good dating history to try to see like, you know,
what kind of person's going to gel with you? I'm very opposed to the idea of people getting
married super young. I'm very opposed to that idea. I know that's, a lot of people feel like
that's the good approach to marriage longevity. I think, I think instead in those cases, you can
sometimes hit the jackpot and other times, you know, you were kind of 45 and you wake up and you,
you know, have to upend your whole life to say, I have to get out of this relationship,
which is very destructive, you know, divorce. I think, honestly, hell and divorce are
pretty close together, the ideas of those two experiences. And I think it's good to experience
and then at some point to say, okay, now to move forward and kind of evolve into
who I'm going to be for the, for the long haul is to, is to settle down with the person.
Yeah, I agree. All said. Yeah, there's a couple other things I wanted to talk to you about.
I think now would be a good time to talk about what is healthy masculinity and healthy femininity
look like. You said femininity without struggling. I always struggle with that.
That's a tough one. Yeah, I think I even wrote it with just like,
just endless anonymity. Yeah, I, I think so this is what's really interesting, right? Because
with the way people think today, it's that if you, if you give a proper definition to something,
people are like, well, they'll think about the exceptions to that, right? So I want to talk about
this on a general level, because it's like, that's one thing that's gone out of style is pointing
out that what are men like and what are women like? It's like, well, some men can be like that and
some women can be like that. It's like, yeah, with eight billion people, there are always
exceptions to everything, but there's a general ideas of, and there are a lot of similarities
between most men and a lot of similarities between most women, but there are always exceptions.
I think positive feminine, positive masculinity to me means a person that is, is oriented towards
protection, you know, who's strong, you know, because men are, are born to be strong, to be
physically strong. And I think psychologically for men, engaging with physical strength is actually
really good for them. And I think that trend of modern life that doesn't really reward physical
strength is not, it's not, that's not a good thing for men. And I think encouraging men to be strong,
but also dangerous and capable of being dangerous, but then knowing how to be gentle,
like that right balance of, of dangerous and gentle, which is why, you know,
martial arts is such an interesting endeavor for men is because they learn that discipline of how
to be really, really strong, but how to apply that, that strength in the right frame of mind.
And part of that I think is, is stoicism, which is so, I feel like it's such a misunderstood idea,
because people often look at stoicism like saying, oh, if you're stoic, you reject all emotion,
you know, you, you suppress all of your emotion, you don't feel anything, you don't have space to feel.
And I think that's completely wrong. The, the tenants, sorry about the sound,
the motorcycle sound, but the tenant, tenants of, of stoicism is to say,
one of those is, is what you and I were talking about earlier, that you can't control what's
going to happen to you. You can't control what the world is going to be like. What you can control
is how you react to it and whether or not you allow your circumstances to destabilize your mind.
And so the antithesis to stoicism is someone walking into a bar
and the barman calls you ma'am, but you identify as, as not a ma'am and you get angry and you start
throwing a fit and then you go online and start crying and, and making a video complaining about
how much that hurt to hear that. That's the antithesis of stoicism and you have allowed
someone else's actions to make you deeply unhappy and completely, completely upend you. And that's
the point is that stoicism says that are you the master of your emotions or the, are the emotions
the master of you? And I think that's a really important part of what it means to be a man
because men often have to go out and do sort of the harder, physically harder things.
So a mastery of your emotions is really important versus let's say for a woman, which you know,
people might take, take offense at that, but the reason it's so important with men is because men
wield more dangerous physical power. So balance of mind is really important. If a man loses his
cool, he can cause a lot of damage to the people around him. Whereas a woman might just say things,
right? But a man could actually like really hurt some people around him. And so that's why
I think the stoicism aspect is so important to masculinity and that his orientation, his like
focus is about protecting the, should be about protecting the people around him, whether that's
his, you know, wife and mother and, and father and daughter and son. And that's what's really
interesting. One of the things I was looking into was the statistics up around fatherlessness.
And there's so much negative impact of the fatherlessness issue in our society. But one of the,
one of the really shocking ones was that a daughter in a fatherless home is 900% more likely to be
assaulted. And, and you know, my, my friend and I were talking about some, some random stuff we
were talking. And one of the things she pointed out, she was like, you know, when we were looking at
all these Epstein things, all these flight logs and all this stuff going on, she said, her father
said the first thing that her father said was, where are the fathers of all those daughters?
Like, why are those daughters, you know, all those little young girls, why are they in those
situations? And that's the thing is like, you need a strong man to protect young girls from
other nefarious men. You need a strong man paying attention to that. So I think that whole aspect
of protection and children who come from homes where they feel protected is so crucial. And I
think for young men having a man model for them, the importance of positive masculinity is so
important because for young men, they don't learn from moms, just like young girls don't learn femininity
from dads, you know, you need it to be modeled for you to understand. And so that's why then,
you know, it's important to have a coach or a teacher or someone, some male influence, positive
male influence to tell you what's right. But also to keep you in check, young boys, you know, test
the boundaries of life, and they need someone that can challenge them. A mother can't challenge
them after a certain age, but a father can forever if he's taking his responsibility seriously.
And that's one, that was a really good point that Larry Elder had made when he went on the
breakfast club a couple months ago. He said, you know, I was never scared of the police,
what the police might do to me. I was scared of what my father would do to me if I if I misbehaved.
And when you see the amount of youth out there, you know, you were mentioning kind of the city
streets issues, you see a lot of youth out there that's not afraid of the police, they're not afraid
of anybody. And it's because the first person they need to be afraid of was their father as the
primary disciplinary disciplinarian. So I think all of those aspects are really important about
that going to masculinity that end up actually really holding society together that are really
crucial. And then should I move on to femininity? Or do you want to pause here?
That was really beautifully said. And it's the masculinity issue is it has so many sides to it.
Yes. And you were saying that a lot of men find used to find their place in the world through
physical means, you know, they pride themselves on being physically strong.
And for thousands of years, that brought you a lot of value into the world or that
that was your way of adding value to the world was your strength. And now we're living in this
modern world where your physical strength and endurance and just like your your masculine power
isn't isn't quite as useful. And so I think a lot of people are turning to like things like
martial arts as an outlet for that. But still, it's not like you're going to be on the front lines
doing jujitsu to defend your country. Right. It's it's a simulation of of an ancient art. But
there are less and less jobs that require that masculine physical strength. So I think that
an important transition for men is to be there as spiritual protectors now. Yes. Yes.
It's it's just as important as physical protection. And yeah, if you abandon your children,
they're not going to have that spiritual protection or encouragement or guidance. And yeah,
it makes sense. Some of those statistics that you just said that without that spiritual protection,
you couldn't end up in some bad situations. It's a sad situation, especially in San Francisco,
when you walk down any street and you see these people who are engaged in drug abuse. And
they're keeled over. And I look at them sometimes and I feel like I mean, I know this might make
it sound like I'm trivializing the situation. But I often think in movies, I like make connections
to certain scenes and like the emotional resonance of things kind of help stabilize
accordingly to me. But I thought of them and thought about Gollum and how, you know, one of the
things he says is that I forgot the feel of of the wind. I forgot the taste of food. I forgot my
own name. And that's what it seems like to me is that they're forgotten that they're human beings.
And they're willing to actually let themselves be in this very sort of
disjointed, you know, non-human state. And a lot of that comes from
feelings of abandonment of, you know, the statistics around, again, youths that end up,
you know, engaged in drug abuse and running away from home and becoming homeless
are pretty heavily tied to fatherless homes, pretty heavily. It's like 90% of youths that are on the
street are, come from, from fatherless homes. And the thing is that your mother can't abandon you.
A mother might, it's very rare because mothers have the biological attachment. We have the
benefit of that. First of all, child is like literally part of your body. And, but there are
also a lot of hormones and things that engage in bonding that are very, very strong. So it's,
it's almost like a given that a mother is going to be there till the day you die, you know.
Well, that's a weird way to say it. When you mothers rarely see their children die. What am
I saying? I understand what you're saying. You understand what I'm saying. I'm losing my mind,
clearly. Um, mothers are there through the long haul, like you said, but a father has a choice
whether or not to engage with his children and he can choose to walk away. And when a father chooses
to walk away, it actually creates such a fracture for children, a feeling of abandonment, a feeling
that they weren't good enough. And that's such a common thing. By the way, if you see, you know,
in any TV show, there's so many instances of characters that the father wasn't in the picture.
And they have all these abandonment issues as a result. You know, uh, Barney from how I met your
mother is an example of that. You know, Schmidt from new girl is an example of that. I mean,
it's very common. And Barney, when he comes across his father and finds out that he actually has this
family now and has a kid who he named after himself, you know, he Barney feels so, he feels so
terrible. He was like, why was, wasn't I enough for you to do that for you to be there for me?
And so this whole idea that, you know, it's totally fine if a child is raised by single
mothers. And the reason people say that is because they don't want to hurt the feelings
of single mothers. They're doing a very hard job, but it's actually so massive. It's such a massive
problem. And, and then you see them then on the streets and you can understand why one of the,
you know, one half of a very important partnership that needed to make them feel like
they were good enough, was missing from their lives. And, and they didn't know how to,
they don't know how to manage life without that for a lot of people. You know, that's the,
that's the unfortunate occurrence without a father.
One of my most popular videos is how childhood trauma leads to addiction by Dr. Gabor Mate.
And yeah, essentially his, his theory boils down to from a young age, from the moment we're born,
attachment is our number one need. If we don't stay attached to adults, we'll die. So we
hold that over every other value. We need to stay attached to adults.
And we will suppress our authenticity to stay attached. And he says, anytime you suppress
your authenticity is when you create trauma. And the more you suppress your authenticity,
the greater you will chase that feeling of attachment later in life. And things like heroin
I've never done it, but apparently it provides that exact feeling, almost that exact chemical
concoction in the brain of that attachment feeling. So you see some of these addicts living in what
looks like hell on earth, but they inject this drug. And for however long, they are feeling
like they're bathed in love. They're finally getting that hug from their parent that they've
been longing for forever. So that theory seemed to resonate with a lot of people.
That's really, really sad. Yeah. So yeah, you know, there's,
there's two ways to look at these people on the street. You know, a lot, a lot of people see them
as a problem to be solved, but you can also look at them as they are just the products of this
environment that they didn't choose. And, you know, if I was in that situation, would I be the same?
Maybe, you know, probably. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, in that way, you know,
you have to really count blessings, right, that are given to us and, and that have helped prevent
us from falling down that kind of path. But to say, Oh, I would never do that, right? You know,
but, but to say like, no, there, there are situations that you might do that, you know,
or I might do that. So, um, I feel, yeah, I feel really sad for those people because it is such
a misunderstood problem, but it's also a one that there's no sort of, there's no adequate push to
resolve at the moment, unfortunately. Absolutely. There's a YouTube channel called channel five
with Andrew Callahan, I think, and he just did a really good documentary about San Francisco.
And, um, all the car break-ins. I used to live there and my car got broken into six times. I
lived there. So this particular, did they break the tiny window or did they do other things? Just
curious. They pretty much broke every window, okay, including the front windshield at one point.
So, yeah, it's very thorough experience them all. And so when I saw this topic,
I clicked on the video with a lot of emotion like, yeah, we got to get rid of these,
these people. They're like parasites that are just going around causing chaos with no
ramifications. They need to be stopped. And he did such a great job reporting. He finally meets one
of these guys that breaks into the cars and he follows them around for an entire day and gets
to know them really well. And by the end, I'm feeling really bad for this guy. Like he has a
kid that he hasn't seen and he wants to see him and he's, he's got no options. He's hooked on these
fentanyl and he's been abandoned. Kind of, kind of like the typical tragic story. And by the end,
you're like, my God, like I could have been this guy if, if I was in that situation, you know,
you can't, it's hard to judge at that point. Wow. Okay. I, I definitely need to watch that
because, you know, I, I can have empathy. And then there are moments of frustration where I kind
of find myself completely outside of that and very angry. And I think I need to recalibrate a little
bit. Yeah. Yeah, there, there's an idea that we don't have any free will that I don't fully agree
with, but it, there's a lot of logic to it. That, you know, we are products of our environment and
all these variables go into everything is cause and effect. Right. And I think the value in, in
seeing that argument though, is that you don't hold blame on people as much as you would if you
didn't know that idea. Cause when you see somebody committed atrocity, you can kind of see, all right,
at one, at one point, this person was a baby and they just got fumbled around in the wrong way.
And you don't, you don't hold that resentment in your heart towards them. Yeah. If you know
that idea. Yeah. Of course there are lines that you have to set and there are boundaries that
have to be drawn. So you can't just be indifferent on everything. Right. But I think it's helpful to
have that idea in your mind as well. Yeah. You, you know, that completely makes sense because
it's not like they got, they have no free will, but there is, they need to have some level of
positive influence to at least help them see what's a good path for them of how they can
create a better life. But if they never get that opportunity, how could they see? It's not like
we're born with any kind of inherent understanding of good. We, we have, we have some level of where
we can gauge, oh, this is a good thing to do and this is not, but it takes a lot of thought and,
and sort of exploration to get to that. It's not kind of built in.
Absolutely. Well, I guess we should probably round this segment out with the femininity side.
Yes. So what does positive femininity look like? So
I think femininity is not about physical strength. That's not to say that some women aren't physically
strong and if, if that's what they are interested in, I think femininity is about
a different sort of emotional and mental strength. It takes a lot to,
first of all, walk around as a, as a sort of a weaker, weaker part of society.
Uh, in a lot of ways, if I'm just going about my day, uh, I have to make sure I'm thinking about
where I might be putting myself at risk and I have, I have responsibility to myself and my
loved ones to make sure that I don't put myself in situations where I'm at risk. And in those cases,
it's, it is this weird, um, relationship that every woman has with men where a man at,
on an empty street, dark street could be your perpetrator or your savior. It could be either.
You know, you, you don't know, you might either be really happy to see him or really sad to see him.
And I think that one of those important aspects of, of being a woman is to be very responsible.
And I mean, and this is one of those things that women, women, modern women really hate this idea,
but there's a reason why women mature faster is because we, first of all, puberty for women,
it means we are inundated with a lot of negative emotion, which I recall that moment. And suddenly
I went from being a very happy child to very sad all the time. And, you know, we had our,
we have our initiation into womanhood that men don't have. You know, we, we know when we're
suddenly women, we actually have a very strong bookend for that or sorry, like, I guess not a
bookend, but, um, transition for that. And, uh, that means suddenly you're looked at differently.
You have to behave differently. You have to, you have to be a lot more thoughtful on how you're
presenting yourself to the world. And, uh, I think part of that is also then how you engage with men
and how you allow men to look at you. This is something I feel very strongly about,
but I think about it's very important for positive femininity to be about imposing
lines on, uh, with how, like boundaries around how men engage with you and, and converse with you,
relate with you. Um, and, you know, this was something that when I was growing up, it was a
good thing I'd grown up on books like Pride and Prejudice and, you know, Emily Bronte's books.
Like I had, I grew up on kind of very old fashioned perspectives on, on the feminine.
And when I got to college and every man thought that it was perfectly acceptable to get my affection
or my time by just sending me a you up text was so angering that that's what passed as,
as modern romance. And I found it so deeply offensive that, that it was perfectly acceptable
that a man could look at me like a commodity that he could get at the end of the night. Um,
just by sent, you know, either buying me a drink or sending me something like that. And I think
forget about what anybody thinks on an individual level as a woman, you will live a much better
life if you have a strong control on how people, how people, how much people sexualize and commodify
you. And, um, you know, and this is something I could talk about honestly, endlessly, but the,
the, the biggest difference, the biggest impact is kind of how, how, if, if you set a boundary on
how other people treat you, you also end up really ensuring that you, you treat yourself
properly, that you respect yourself. It's really easy. Again, coming back to that, like people
kind of rushing to whatever is easy today. It's really easy for me to monetize myself on my body.
I could start an only fans tomorrow. I have a YouTube channel. I could tell them, Hey,
I'm starting an only fans and I could be making money. I'm, I mean, I'm like, whatever looking,
whatever, but I could do that because it's really easy for a woman to make money by commodifying
herself. But does that mean that you're going to be endlessly happy and respect yourself and have
healthy relationships with opposite sex or your children or your parents? Absolutely not. It's
because you're telling someone else that they can buy your body and that's how, that's how the world
is going to treat you. They're going to treat your body like a commodity. So I think that sort of
conservative approach to how you let the world talk to you is really, really healthy for on an
individual level for a woman. And then the other aspect of it is like, what's your responsibility
to the opposite sex? Let's say your husband or your part, you know, your, your male partner,
specifically we were talking about men and women here. I think men unfortunately don't have a lot
of opportunity to have an outlet for their emotion. I think partly societal and partly I think it's
just how men sort of prefer to be. And I think being that sort of sort of creating that space for
your husband or your boyfriend or whoever to have an outlet and talk to you and share with you
and share with you sort of all of their insecurities and fears and giving them that
opportunity to do so without having ramifications or like, you know, reputation issues or punishing
them is really important because we women are really good at that. And this is something I
didn't really realize until, until I was married. So I, you know, I have a brother, but I honestly
didn't understand this until I got married was that, you know, my husband talks to his father
about his issues or he talks to me, but that's, but that's it. I talked to my husband, I talked to my
dad, I talked to my mom, I talked to my brother, I talked to my sister-in-law, I talked to my
friend, I talked to my other friend, I talked to my other friend. I have endless sources of places
where I actually have an outlet for my emotions and my issues and all of that and everybody,
you know, receives it and says, go, go ahead, you cry, you feel it, all of that. And I noticed
that with my husband, he doesn't have a lot of those. Like he's not, he's not even willing to do
that, but it's like, he actually doesn't have adequate outlets for that. And that's one, one of
those aspects I think is really important is that if men are going to be those like spiritual
protectors, like you were talking about, and I love that idea, that concept of spiritual protective,
that's so important, that they also need to have a place where they can be weak and have an outlet
for that emotion. And I think that's really important for women to do that. And, you know,
modern women hate it being told like, we need to do this for our husbands. Like it's like, it's like,
you know, this absolutely loads some idea to say to a woman these days, but just like men
owe women things. And for us to say, oh, a husband should endeavor to do this for his wife. That's
a good thing. We say, oh, that's a good thing. Yes, husbands should do things for their wives.
But that's the same thing is that, you know, we women have responsibilities as well. And I think
our emotional intelligence is our greatest strength, our ability to, to comfort, to care for. I mean,
that we should not, we should not reject those ideas. That's, that's our greatest strength. The
whole, the whole foundation of family is built on a woman that's willing to build a good family.
But the protection and safety and ultimate success of the family is based on a husband
and his willingness to protect his family. And I think in that way is where you partner up and
create this really strong connection between the best of both sexes for, you know, ultimate success.
That was beautifully put. You, you, you keep giving me a lot to think about. And I'm taking notes
here. I did a video this summer to try to clarify sex and gender. It was a big video. And I knew
it would be risky to make. But we, I worked with Heather Heying and Brett Weinstein on it. Oh,
what a, what, I mean, what a great partnership there. So they look at this entire issue from
a evolutionary biology lens. And it was really interesting to just look at it through that lens.
But when you take it down to like the sperm and the egg, you have
thousands and thousands of sperm competing, competing for that one egg. And that translates to
our behavior in the real world. Men typically are more focused on what happens before reproduction,
whereas women are more focused on what happens after reproduction, because they
have to take care of the child. Whereas men, so you typically see men competing a lot more.
And they're fighting with, with each other for a mate. And it is the woman's job to be a filter
and to, to be selective. And I think that manifests in what we value in men and women,
like we, it's really seen as valuable for a man to be able to provide.
Because that sets him competitively, that sets him out from the herd. And it also shows that he
could be an asset after the child is born. He can create a stable environment for that child
down the road. Whereas what men value in women is fertility, but also a big thing that you are
speaking on that often gets overlooked is the ability to be selective, the ability to be that
filter, which is the ability to set boundaries and say no. And so if a woman shows that she's
able to say no, her value goes way up in the eyes of men. And yes, that, that only fans life is very
alluring. It's right there. It's that instant gratification. And it's, it can be hard to say no
to it. But the second you do that, you completely lose that filter, that value. And you can never
get it back. Yeah, which is something, you know, feminism is trying to change that. So fourth wave
feminism, I think we're evolving past fourth wave and into fifth wave, I don't know when they'll
make that declaration. But I think, you know, fourth wave was all about sort of DVI and, and
actual, like, I think at fourth wave, they've achieved a lot of success by actually infiltrating
HR departments and writer rooms. And they, you know, they've gotten some level of critical,
critical mass. But fifth wave, if we could make that argument that we're entering that is,
might I lose my train of thought? Fifth wave, like a fifth wave, do we even have women anymore?
Or is that concept just become relative? Yeah, no, that I think so. The whole breakdown of the
definition of woman really happened at the third wave. But we didn't hear about it until the fourth
wave. Because the whole third wave was based on intersectionality, as well as this book that Judith
Butler, I always find it hard to say her name, but Judith Butler, who is a who is a professor at UC
Berkeley, wrote this book called Gender Trouble, where she sort of brought to popularity the concept
of gender roles, you know, being something that you could jump between, sorry, gender and sex
being something you could jump between, that it could, and, you know, she, she identifies as
non-binary, so prefers to go by they. So it really got introduced then. But what was the thing you
said? Sorry, what was the last thing you had said right before? Was it about fifth wave and how we're
just going to get so relative that we're going to lose the definitions of everything? But right
before that, what was like the point? I was talking about women are the filter. Oh, and only fans,
yes, okay, so now I caught it, sorry. That fifth wave is going to is really going to be about
finalizing this concept that sex work is just regular work. And that commodifying of the of
the body is totally fine. And I think part of that is already in motion. There's a lot of push for
the de-stigmatization of adult industry work, because women are the ones, you know, they say
that suffer the consequences for that, for good reasons, as you've explained, and I completely
agree with all of those, which is that it's, you know, a filtration system for a woman is far more
important than for a man. And that's the big push that women are suffering for having to engage with
the adult industry, because you know, due to limited economic issues, you know, resources that a woman
might turn to something like only fans, and then she's ostracized for the rest of her life. And that
should not be allowed. Why is it that men are not and when men are the main consumers of something
like that? Why is that not why is that not forgiven for women or even not even considered for women?
And the other thing that's going to happen is going to be the overhauling of woman, you know,
that idea of woman bearing children. I think that's going to be the next push is going to be that,
oh, well, we should just be relying on science to bear children, and that even a surrogate is
totally fine, that's going to be the next push policy wise, which in America is a lot more lenient,
but in other countries, it's considered pretty, pretty difficult thing to accept, because what
you're doing through surrogacy, and this is something Louise Perry talks a lot about,
that she talks about how, you know, you're intentionally breaking a very important bond
between mother and child. And I'm sure Gabor Mate would have a lot to say about that as well,
because, you know, that there's a lot of trauma attached to that, because, you know, the baby,
the first heartbeat that he or she hears is the mother's heartbeat, the smell. I mean, the baby
doesn't even, for the first couple, for a long time, doesn't even feel like they're apart from the
mother, right? Even after being born, they feel like the mother's body is their body. It's like a
very deep connection that you intentionally break through surrogacy. So, I think there's a lot of
moral questions that people are going to try to raise, that, you know, the next wave of feminism
is going to say, no, well, you know, it's totally fine to farm out someone, some other woman's body
for, for my particular needs or your particular needs, that should be totally okay and considered
a regular transaction. And that's, that's really what is, we're looking at is the general commodification
of the female body. And, and, and that being totally okay.
Well, yeah, if we're going to take it to the future trajectory, yeah, I think we're not that far away
from AI porn and things like that. So, yeah, it'll, yeah, the, the, the competition may be with
these AI porn bots. And that's going to be hard to compete with because those things are going to
have no taboos. Those things will be able to go to the wildest fantasy and beyond. And I don't think
any human would be able to compete with that. So perhaps we're going to go so full cycle, we're
going to go all the way around where, you know, every sex work is going to be incentivized. And
then it's going to be just like, we can't compete with these AI bots. Let's just go back to having
like peaceful civil romance or something. Hopefully, if I'm being optimistic, maybe it'll just
get so chaotic that people are like, I'm done with this. I'm getting off this train.
Yeah. I, I actually think that I don't think we're headed into a dark future. I think things are
really dark now and are likely to be for a little bit, but I don't think our future is dark. I think,
I think we're in a very difficult transition period where we've lost that. Like I was saying that
that man in the sky to tell us what to do. And we've overextended individual freedom so much
that we feel completely spiritually lost. And now I think it's going to be about bringing things
back together, hopefully, but without reliance on, on, because God said so, but instead, because
this is what's good for everybody, I think we're going to build a new morality system is what I
think is going to happen because it's kind of already happening. You know, the idea that porn
is bad for you, if, if you said that five years ago or 10 years ago, people would be like, shut up,
who cares? You know, no, it's not. And now that actually that idea is, is taking hold. People
are understanding why porn is so bad for you. And many people are choosing to stay away from it,
completely stay away from it. Same with alcohol, same with birth control. You know,
birth control is just considered this magic thing. And now there's so much awareness being spread
that birth control is actually devastating to your hormones, hormones, and that you should
absolutely get away from it. And many people are resentful that their doctors, their primary care
physicians didn't warn them about the side effects that they could expect, because a lot of people,
women felt suicidal on it, emotional on it, still do. And, and then the impact on it later is, is
after once, once you get off of it, it's also pretty, pretty big. But again, people like Andrew
Huperman, you know, is shedding a lot of light on stuff like that. So I think we're an, and even
fatherlessness now, that's like a big conversation that we're having, right? I think it's all sort of
gone from research to entering the, the general conversation. And now it's just going to spread
from here. And there's this whole slice of society that's so intent upon making themselves
as great as possible. And I think they watch your channels like yours, they watch channels like
Chris Williamson, like Andrew Huperman, Brett Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, and they,
they are intent upon building a good life for themselves that's, you know, without caffeine
or like full of workouts and, and, you know, thinking about their problems and not,
you know, suppressing them. It's like all these great things. And then also understanding their
moral code, or understanding the value of religion. I mean, how many people watched
Jordan Peterson's lecture on, on Genesis, and then his seminar on, on Exodus? I mean, people
are engaging that without being religious themselves. And they're seeing that kind of like
the Chesterton's fence thing is that, you know, religion has its values. You don't have to turn
into a dogmatic, you know, person who's going and looking down at everybody for, for believing
certain, not believe, not believing certain ideas, which is what religion really turned into for a
lot of people is that it became this tool for their ego and to beat down on other people and
tell them they're going to hell. But no, religion has individual value. That's so, that's so
wonderful. And I think it's all about taking the ego out of it. And I think that's going to be the
new form of morality that's going to burgeon up. It's going to be an intellectual morality.
And, and, and so I, I'm very hopeful that a lot of things are going to turn around.
Hmm. That's, that's brilliant. Yeah. I love what you just said. And I think we've now had enough time
to see the second order effects of a lot of things that we thought were like the solutions,
the be all and all solutions. And now we're saying, okay, 20 years later, what's the second order
effects of all these antidepressants we've given everybody? Yeah. What's the second order effects
of all the ADHD medication we've given out birth control? You know, we're now starting to see,
oh, wow, there, you know, you, there's nothing, no such thing as a free lunch.
We know there's, there's an impact. There's unintended consequences to everything.
So unfortunately, we're still doing things right now, where we're going to see down the line,
the second order effects. But I think a lot of people that are optimistic enough to be parents
in this modern world are going to have the tools now to teach their kids about
second order effects, instead of saying, Hey, no, you can't do that. Hey, don't watch porn,
no matter what, you're not allowed to, and they say why, and you're like, I don't know,
it's bad. Instead of saying that, you could lay out a path and say, look, down the line,
this is how it affects you. And this is how it'll derail your entire life. So
it depends on what you want. If you want a family and a successful career and to be fit,
you can't get derailed in this way. But if your goal is just to be derailed,
or if you don't have a goal, then by all means go down these impulsive paths. But I think it's
having the ability to lay that out for a next generation is really important so that they have
like a healthy compass of the world. Because like in Genesis, the first one of the first stories,
it is human nature to want to do what we're not allowed to. That's like the first thing humans
want to do. God puts Adam and Eve on earth and says, don't eat that fruit. First thing they're
going to do is eat it. So, you know, maybe if he explained what happens if you eat it,
they would have chosen differently. Yeah, yeah. And my husband and I were talking about that
because he recently gave up alcohol. I say recently, but it's been more than a year.
And it's funny because every time he tells people that he gave up alcohol,
people will say, well, were you an alcoholic? You know, it's like they assume that you had
this major problem. And that's why you had to give it up. When he just realized like,
I just didn't feel good with it. And, and one of the things he was thinking about is like,
oh, when we have kids, at least I feel more now emboldened and empowered with, with information
to say, why you should not drink alcohol or have a healthy relationship with it at least.
But that when he was growing up, it was just like, because I said so and same with me and the
ideas around modesty. I grew up in a very modest household. I grew up, you know, and I took to
it. I, I wasn't really rebellious about it. I actually felt like it actually felt kind of natural
to me to be modest. And, but as I grew up, it started to make sense to me. And I of course
tested a lot of the theories out when I was in college because I did want to have my rebellious
time. But I had to like stumble into the understanding of why me treating my body as
something that was sacred was important for my mental health. And for me to actually have a
very successful relationship then in the future with whoever I ended up with forever is that
then he also knew that I had treated my body as very sacred and wasn't. So it was, it took time
to understand that. And now, and, and now, you know, you have writers like Louis, Louis Perry
explaining the ideas of why modesty is so important. Or, you know, you shouldn't get drunk around,
you know, these in these like fat parties of because of what kind of impact that might have on you.
And she does it all without lending to religion at all. And, and if she had, you know, I don't
think it's wrong to rely on religion. But I think people feel like religion is an
incomplete answer to them. And so it's like she's instead explaining like the full path of it and
bringing it back to the individuals like what exactly happens, you know, if you if you engage in
one path versus another, I think we're just getting those like very detailed answers to things.
Yeah, we're very lucky right now where we're living in this age of we have so much access to
information. Yes, I'm so grateful to people like Jordan Peterson, who are taking all these incredible
philosophers and old texts, and he's filtering it down into such an easy way to understand.
And same with religious texts, too. Yeah.
It's because of Jordan Peterson that I've looked into Carl Jung and Victor Frankel.
And all these other philosophers that, you know, you hear him mention a name enough times,
you're like, Okay, I should probably check out that book. And it's, he's really been like,
well, I guess you could bring it down to like Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan led me to him. And then he
led me to like 20 other great philosophers. And I keep going down this rabbit hole. Now I'm like,
getting into these very obscure, ancient occult type things. And I'm like, Wow, how did I get here?
Yeah. Okay. Is this an okay time for me to tell you about Vibhashna?
Do you want to do you want to talk about that?
Yeah. Because I think I think it's a good wrap on everything as well.
So I've told you this, but I, at the end of last year, when for a 10 day silent retreat,
it's called Vibhashna where you live like a monk for 10 days. You don't, you have certain precepts
like morality precepts that you have to follow. For example, you don't engage in misconduct,
you don't lie. For those 10 days, you're sort of taking this oath. You don't kill anything.
So even if there's an insect in your room, they have like a little way for you to take it out.
So you don't kill the insects, you're eating vegetarian food. But specifically, it's through
this organization called, it's maybe it's called just Dhamma, D-H-A-M-M-A. And it follows,
it follows the precepts set by Buddhism, like Buddha specifically from, you know, centuries ago.
Buddha himself discovered this practice when he was meditating and he discovered it based on ancient
Indian texts that were sort of lost. So he rediscovered this technique and then he crystallized it into
this method of 10 days of meditation that help you achieve, start to achieve sort of an understanding
of your path to enlightenment. And my friend convinced me to do this. I was very, very skeptical.
She's been trying to convince me for 10 years, but the idea of being in silence and without
any access to, you know, my material world felt very frightening to me. And I'm so glad I went,
she finally convinced me and I went. And the whole idea is that it's actually completely free.
And they don't even let you donate before you take a course. So that's actually part of the
mechanism to get you into the right mindset, which is that you are here with all this room and board
and food that's being served to you, you're here by the grace of other people's charity.
Other ex-students have paid for your ability to be here. And that alone, that begins that sort of
humility practice to help you recognize that you need to, that maybe this is a good time to sort of
rethink your approach to life. Because, you know, modern life, we're relying on ourselves,
we go out and about, like I pay for my lunch, you know, I'm, I've been relying on myself for,
for, you know, better part of, you know, 20 years, whatever. So to suddenly be there on
someone else's charity felt very strange, but that's how monks and nuns live, right?
And that's what you're engaging in. You're engaging in the very simple life.
And you're not allowed to talk to anybody. You can't look at anybody in the eye. Everything's
kind of set up as like a self-service situation. And the men and women are completely separated.
So that you're not distractions to each other. And then the primary thing you're doing
is that you're meditating pretty much for most of the day. It's like 10 hours of meditation a day.
And you learn a specific meditation technique. So even though you're not allowed to talk to
anybody, they do have a discourse where the teacher teaches you about the system of meditation
and why it's important. So you're kind of learning the tenets of, of, of Dhamma.
And it's a non-religious, completely, you know, completely sort of secular universal
ideas that they talk about. And they all, they talk about the, the kind of what is,
what is the cause of everyone's misery. And, you know, this is something Buddhists talk about
all the time, which is attachment. But specifically what they talk about is this,
we're caught in the cycle of craving and aversions. And this was something that was really important
for me because I am actually prone to this massive iPhone addiction. I mean, it was bad.
And that was something I realized that every time through this practice, every time I was,
you know, writing a video for my, for my channel, and I would run into something
difficult, some difficult part, I didn't know what to write as the next sentence,
immediately pick up the phone, right? It's because I had an aversion felt terrible,
had a craving to stop the aversion, pick up the phone, phone is a distraction.
You know, and that's sort of how I've been living my life for some time now
of just using my phone as a distraction. And what's amazing about Vipassana is that
you have nowhere to run. You are meditating, you're going inward. You don't have anyone to talk to.
You don't have any distractions of modern life, like your phone, like your computer,
but you don't even have an occupation. You don't even have a job to keep you mentally busy.
You just have to reconcile with yourself. And that whole forced process of that you're just
sitting with yourself is so interesting. It's, it's really difficult. It's extremely difficult.
It was like way too much time to spend with myself. But the learnings out of it are so incredible.
And then what you start to notice through the Vipassana practice of a specific type of meditation,
which I won't get into here, but it actually starts getting all of your, all those things
that you've been running from, it allows it to come out. It allows it to surface. And it'll surface
either as a thought or as a sensation on your body or emotion. And they warn, they warn you
that specific days tend to be really difficult for people. And fifth day was the first day that
I noticed that a lot of people were crying around me. And I was very emotional. It's like stuff
just, it's just, there's been enough time that you've been sitting in silence that stuff starts
to really come out. And that's what the whole practice is really about is just try to recognize
the misery cycle that people tend to keep themselves in and how to release themselves from it.
And it was the most transformative experience of my life. It's something, you know, I know
you're curious about it, I would highly, highly recommend. But that's also why I wanted to bring
it up here in case this is something that is interesting to other people. They should definitely
check it out because I think it's a very easy, we live in a world where we can get every one of our
sort of immediate needs met, sort of what you've, you've been talking about this, you know, the,
the sketch you were talking about. So it's a very hard to meet our, it's very easy to meet our basic
needs. It's our spiritual needs that go completely ignored. And this was a great opportunity to
sort of reset my priorities. Like one of the things I noticed is that I, I love my family,
I love my husband, I love my friends. And mentally I was deprioritizing them over my phone.
That like there was a part of me that was irritated if someone was talking to me because
that meant I wasn't on my phone. I mean, that's how bad my addiction was. I mean,
it's really embarrassing to even say it. But this thing completely helped me see that. And I felt
that ache that that's what I was doing in my life. And, and so it helps you sort of reset a lot of
things actually understand what your real priorities are. That sounds amazing. Wow. So that was 10
days? 10 days. How did it seem like 10 days? Or did it seem longer? Seem longer. Definitely
seem longer. And I think the first couple of days like past glacially slow, because the meditation
periods, you know, are really long. And then it changes your perception of time, you know,
suddenly sitting because you meditate for one hour at a time, just, just about. And that first
couple of sessions felt so long. And then slowly you're like, Oh, one hour meditation doesn't sound
that bad, you know, anymore. And, and now we keep up the practice, you have to, you know, if you
want to continue to engage with it, it's up to you. But you keep up a daily practice of it as well.
But yeah, it did feel incredibly long. And then especially at the end, because one of the things
I just really struggled with was just missing company. It's like, I'm really lonely. And so I
got to I think by day nine, I just started started to really like, come on, we're almost there, almost
there. Wow. So have you had enough time to process the experience? Like, have you changed?
Yes, I have. I think, I think there were a lot of ideas, if you go, let's say, I think what you
might find is that there are a lot of ideas that aren't really new to you. You've been circling
around them, you know, in your, in your intellectual endeavors, just like, as you know, that's how I
felt. Because I think they're all ideas that that makes sense on a universal level. Whether it's
Stoicism telling you about it, or Jordan Peterson talking about it, or Carl Jung talking about it,
there are a lot of similarities in that understanding. But there was one final piece that
felt like it was missing, where I was like circling around the ideas. But that didn't mean that
it had internalized quite. So as part of this, this philosophy, you know, the teachings of Dhamma,
one of the things he talks about is that there are three types of the main teacher. His name is
Goenka, who has passed on now, but there are recordings of him, where he, he just gives the
lesson. And one of the things he talks about is that there are three different types of
wisdom. One is you hear someone else give you a piece of wisdom. Another is that you yourself
understand it, where you can intellectually completely understand it, and relate it to other
people. But then there's a third piece of wisdom, where you feel it. And he gave the example of,
of medicine, that if a doctor tells you, Oh, you're sick, you need to take this medicine. And you say,
Oh, that's great, doctor, thank you for this medicine. That's you recognizing this other
person giving you this piece of wisdom. You can go and possess the medicine. That's you
understanding it, you go when to the pharmacy and filled the your prescription. But until you
take it, it's not going to help you. And that was the piece that I felt was missing, where I,
you know, one of the things that's due to the difficulties of the last couple of years.
It's, it's really taken a toll on my body. So for, you know, for about a year ago, I just came
out of this period where I had a lot had like massive hair fall, like massive hair fall. And
I also developed a chronic health issue in that, in that period. So it was like, I understood the
ideas that people were telling me intellectually, but I hadn't quite internalized it, where it wasn't
being all these issues and miseries of my life were still being stored in my body and we're
still taking a toll on me mentally and physically and spiritually. And this, this going to this
help take me to that finish line, where I'm not saying I'm fixed or anything like that, but at
least understanding the principle of how to help myself and how to engage with, with, with, with
my issues. That was, that was extremely, extremely necessary.
That's incredible. Well, I, it sounds like an experience I could benefit greatly from.
I'm, I'm, you're not going to change too much though, right? You're still going to get your
channel, right? I might become too zen and just float out of here.
Do you think this is going to inform your future content? Are you going to take it in a different
direction? Yes, I think so. I think, you know, one of the conversations you and I had had last
time, like I was telling you, the, you know, you've inspired me to be less sort of
attacking about things and more, more sort of create positive visions for things. So I,
you know, you had, you had sort of told me about how you think about those things.
And that was something I was kind of mulling over in my, my mind. And now I understood why
that's so important for me to do that. So I don't want to be sitting and just bashing things. And
it's okay, I think, to criticize stuff. I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
I think that's a necessary part of any dialogue, but to be constantly dunking on something is not
something that I want to engage with. I think that, that instead trying to spread as much
positivity and love as possible is, is really what, what I kind of gleaned from, from this experience.
That's amazing. I think for the last couple of years, the level of cynicism has been increasing,
but I feel like it, it might get to a breaking point where people are going to
get keen to it and say, I'm done with this cynicism. Cause even, even in our area,
we're like critical drinker. He'll make a video about how horrible a movie is, and that will get
three million views. And then he'll say, Hey, this movie's pretty good. And that'll get like
a couple hundred thousand views. And even myself, like when I see, he's like,
he says, this movie really sucks. I'm like, Oh, this is going to be a great review.
Let's hear a critical drinker just dunk on this movie. Yeah.
But that's fine. I hope he keeps doing that. Yeah. But because the movies do suck,
they need to get dunked on, but yeah, someone has to dunk on them. Come on. And he does it so well.
Yeah. We need a positive image of the future. We need a vision that we can,
that gets us out of bed in the morning. And I was, I just did a podcast about the pyramids in
Egypt. And one thing that's so special about them is they're so mysterious, but when you see them,
you realize that possibilities are endless. And you're looking at something that is impenetrable
to time. And for one moment, you get a glimpse into this thing that is like eternal. And it
makes you feel like you're part of this thing that's eternal. And that even though your physical
body was going to go away, part of your essence can just like ripple on forever. And
when you, it's easy when you're in this matrix world, where everything's so temporary,
and the buildings are all concrete and glass, and everything's put together so fast and carelessly,
you kind of feel like you're just a cognitive machine. You're just disposable. And
yeah, I feel like the importance of getting outside of the matrix into these situations like
what you just did, or seeing the pyramids, or just anything that takes you out of your normal
state of consciousness. Maybe it's psychedelics, who knows, can show you,
can let you touch a different state and see time in a different way, to see yourself in a
different way and step outside yourself. So yeah, it's very important to mix things up. Otherwise,
it's like Groundhog Day, same thing every day. Yeah. Yeah. And look, you know, especially true for
SF is that it's very easy to distort your own reality and think that this is life. This is
everything that's happening, the chaos that's happening on these city streets is life. And
suddenly I found myself in these beautiful woods, and it's snowing, and there are deer about, and
woodpeckers in the trees, and there are, you know, ducks in the pond. And I thought, wow,
what, you know, I'm so wrapped up in one type of existence that I can't, I can't even perceive
anything else sometimes. So it's good to, just like you said, just good to break out of it.
Yeah, well, I don't think your phone addiction is that bad, actually, because when you were
saying that, I was like, oh boy, that's, I do the same thing. Sometimes when somebody's talking to
me, well, I've got my phone out, I'm like, all right, just want to see this one more meme, hold
on. Yeah, yeah, it can get bad. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's designed to keep you
hooked, you know, it's designed to keep you swiping forever. Yeah, I mean, I just got back from a trip,
and I had my, my phone on airplane mode, I didn't want to do the roaming. And so I, my mind was
like, okay, you're gonna be back in Wi-Fi pretty soon, you're getting closer to Wi-Fi. And I felt
like my mind, I'm like, can you just enjoy what you're doing now instead of worrying about when
you're gonna get to that, like, I felt like a guy that was swimming through the ocean trying to get
to an island. There's Wi-Fi, it was bad. Okay, I, that, so, okay, so as part of a question I, they
have you, you know, hand in your phone, you can either leave it in your car or you leave it in a
locker. And I found myself not missing the phone at all. Because I'm on the phone, even when I'm
brushing my teeth. I mean, it's, like I said, it's bad. Nothing you're saying is that bad.
I'm glad you're validating that other people are also there doing, doing this along with me.
Hopefully I'm not enabling you though. No, I have changed, I'm, I'm now reformed.
Hopefully it sticks is the question, because you know, it's like two weeks, we're two weeks out of
this, so, but I did not miss the phone. But when it was time to get it again, I reached for it in
this dark locker, it's just a single phone. And it honestly felt like I was reaching for the ring
from Lord of the Rings, you know, and Gandalf reaches down for it. And I'm like, and it felt like
hot in my hand. And I went to sit down because I was eating breakfast with my friend, she was,
she's the one who had convinced me, so she was there, finally we could talk. And
it was like, I was talking to her, but like my attention mentally was on that phone.
And, and I thought, wow, it's so strange, because then she got up, she left, and I turned it on.
And I saw like my usual, you know, notifications, okay, text from mom and dad, like, okay,
check my, you know, Instagram real quick, check YouTube real quick, check Twitter real quick.
And then I thought, really, like this is, this is the thing. Yeah, but like this is what all the
consternation is about, just for those like four or five things of engagement, that then you just
cycle between all day for what, you know, and what satisfaction that that gave you
in that moment, you've got nothing out of that, you got not a damn thing, not as much
as satisfaction as you had talking to your best friend over, you know, over breakfast a minute ago.
And so the whole ride home, we had a long ride, so I had a long time to think about it.
And I said, okay, it has to change, like the relationship has to change, like it has utility,
it is the must in modern life, but you have to change that it should not be
moving on your person at all times, like again, it's like the ring, it's like the ring, where
when I'm walking around and I have my hand in my coat, because it's SF, so it's cold all the time,
my hand is around the phone, you know, like that, like that level of engagement with it,
or what if I'm around the house, it's in my back pocket, if I'm at my desk, it's sitting right
here on the desk, if I'm standing in the kitchen, it's on the counter next to me, if I'm in the
bathroom, it's in the bathroom with me, if I'm in my bedroom, it's on my side table, why such an
intense like it is, it's like I'm attached to it. And so I said, okay, no, it's going to live in the
kitchen 24 seven, it's not going to be here next to you, if you need it, you can get up,
use it in the kitchen, then you can leave it there and come back. And that has been the new
system, so it's not allowed in the bathroom, it's not allowed in the bedroom, nowhere,
it just lives in the kitchen. And that has been really, really good. I keep trying to break it.
But I'm like, nope, don't forget, you know, I need to do it for 30 days, and then it'll
hopefully stick from there, and I don't have to force it as much.
Well, that's, yeah, that's a great insight that you tapped into. And you're inspiring me, I should
probably do the same thing. I might need the 10 day retreat to really like, jolt me into it.
It's ironic, because we're both content creators or influencers or however you want to put it, but
it's like we make our career online. And a lot of the things that we're spreading are awareness
about your behavior, which if you listen to us, you might get offline. So we're like, wait,
don't listen to us too much. Yeah, yeah. But I also think that, you know, when I was on the retreat,
a lot of the time I actually was thinking about when, you know, when you have breaks and stuff,
and you're not like meditating, I was thinking about a lot of movie scenes, I was thinking about
TV shows, certain quotes that were sticking out to me and like given books, certain books. And I
thought that's one thing I realized is that because of my phone addiction, I actually
deprioritize all the things that I genuinely love. And I mentioned family and friends and my husband,
but I actually even, even art, like sitting and watching Lord of the Rings felt feels like,
oh, it takes too much time out of the day, but me being on the phone for four hours, you know,
not cumulate, not all at once, but cumulatively throughout the day. Yeah, I'm probably on the
phone for four, four hours. So that's okay, doing something that brings you no joy, but watching
something really nice or even a, you know, a YouTube video that you like that you find informative,
interesting, whatever, versus just mindlessly scrolling. And I think that was actually the
big thing is that I'm still, you know, I'm still consuming things. But it's stuff, it's just being
about more mindful and what impact it has on me. I think that that was the shift is that engaging,
actually engaging with art on a day-to-day basis versus scrolling Twitter, where I go through,
you know, 15 different types of emotion in rapid succession in under a minute. You know, what does
that really do for me? I'm outraged at this and excited by that and ambivalent to this. And what
does that do for me versus sitting and watching something that I actually really like or find
interesting? One of my favorite quotes is from Terrence McKenna. He says, if you don't have a
plan, you become a part of somebody else's plan. And I think about that quote all the time. It's
like nobody wakes up in the morning and says, today I'm going to spend eight hours on my phone.
Nobody does that. But once you slip into a subconscious state, which we operate on 95% of
the time, your mind just reaches for those programs that are like deep grooves in your mind. And
like the more you do an action, the deeper the groove is going to be in your mind. It's like
skiing down a mountain. And so, you know, it's like such a deep program, like there's certain
apps on my phone that I go to all the time. And my finger will automatically scroll and search for
that. If I move the app, I find my thumb like, wait, where'd that go? I'll do it subconsciously.
And then, wait, you know, I'll do it without thinking. Or like I used to go to Facebook so
much that I would go on the computer. And then my fingers would just type in FAC. And I'm like,
I don't even want to go to Facebook right now. Why am I doing this? Or even that moment where
I'll like close the app only to reopen it and not even realize, like I just closed it and I
reopened it. And even the instinct that if my phone is on my desk, I will just instinctively
instinctively reach for it. And it is that that, yeah, like you're saying, it has those groove
marks, right? It's built in after years and years. And that's why that what you learn at
the Bushna is that craving. It's a craving. And you have to meet it immediately. And so you just
leap to meet it immediately. So having that creating that disconnection and recognizing it's
that it's just it's that slight form of distance space between the craving craving coming up and
you resolving it instead going, Oh, look at that craving. I have a craving to be on my phone right
now. Why? Okay, because I just reached something hard in the script in the in my next video script
that I don't know how to resolve. And I feel inadequate. I feel like maybe I'm not good enough
for this. Maybe I'm not good enough for for what I'm trying to be. Maybe I'll never be good enough.
Maybe I'll fail at this. Okay, so you're afraid, like, you know, so just taking it. That's the
weird thing about being a human being is that we're so fear based, we're so anxiety based.
And we make these crazy leaps, you know, we make these crazy leaps of of of the small thing happens
and it'll be like, Well, maybe I'll, I'll die because of this, you know what I mean? It's like
maybe psychologically, I'm completely completely, you know, at risk because of this. So it's very
interesting. Then then we have these tools to then distract us in the moment and keep us away
from that that but it exists somewhere. It's always there. So it's better to address it rather than
let it just just let it hide from you. Oh, yeah, that's very inspiring. You're
I'm definitely going to make some changes after this conversation for sure. Thank you. Thank you
for saying that. And yes, I think you'll find I think you'll find the 10 day retreat really
helpful in doing it. If you know if, yeah, I'll send you I'll send you some stuff about it after.
Yeah, I'd love to check it out. I'm clearly becoming a Bipassana pusher.
Well, I like it that it's not it's not led by like a guru or something. Right. It's kind of just
your own experience. Yeah. And they're very anti ego. It's a very anti ego. Like anytime there's a
a group that's led by one individual who's got like all the answers. I'm always like,
I'm not really into cults. You know, like that's not my thing. Yeah. But this sounds like a very
personal journey, which I've always been drawn towards those experiences like sensory deprivation
tank or psychedelic journey or something like that. Yeah, those have kind of sparked my interest
more because it's like, I don't know, you're just grappling with your own inner journey.
Exactly. I think this, you know, micro dosing around psychedelics is is fascinating. It's
really, really interesting. Yeah, that's something I've covered a lot on my channel.
But it's definitely not the be all end all cure. Like people are are going crazy with it now.
Yeah, it's that I like by the way, I like how you think in quotes, because I feel like I think in
scenes and like movie scenes, I think you think in quotes and you come up with the best ones,
they like the exact right quotes. But there's that that that one, I think it's a Carl Jung quote,
but don't be careful of unearned wisdom. Am I am I right about that?
I'll have to look into that one. That's a good one. Be careful of unearned wisdom.
Yeah. And I think it relates to this is that, you know, psychedelics is people think that it's an
easy route to wisdom, but it's really it's really not it's yeah, it's it's more about building on
what you're already doing and like aiding that rather than suddenly catapulting you into massive
realizations. 100%. Well, this has been an amazing conversation. Thank you. And I'm so excited for
our collaboration to come out. Me too. When this podcast is out, it'll be out. So hopefully people
love it. And if you want to check out baggage claim, it's one of the greatest channels on YouTube.
I watch every video. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. And this was a great
conversation. I really appreciate it. I love talking to you. This was great. It was awesome.
Okay, I'm going to end this transmission.
