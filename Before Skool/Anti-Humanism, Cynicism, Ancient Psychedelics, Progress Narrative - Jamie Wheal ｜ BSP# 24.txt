Hi, Jamie. Welcome. Good to be here, Mark. Yeah, so I've recently discovered your talks
and lectures and I haven't read your books yet, but what I've seen thus far has been
awesome. Daniel Schmockdenberger referred me and said I have to talk to you, so I'm
really excited to talk to you today. Yeah, happy to dive in. I mean, just getting
to check out some of your beautiful drawing and animations on YouTube. It seems like you're
barking up a number of very diverse and eclectic trees, but there is that kind of theme of
sort of just better understanding, you know, the human condition, our past and our future.
So, you know, obviously happy to jump in on all this thing. Yes, I think that you and
I are very aligned on what we're interested in, like from existential crisis to meaning
to psychedelics and everything in between. So I'm really excited to just see where this
conversation goes. For sure. So I thought we could start by just, you could introduce
yourself to the audience. Sure. So my name is Jamie Wheel and I am the founding executive
director of the Flow Genome Project, which is an organization dedicated to the research
and training of peak performance and leadership, and so sort of combination of neuroscience,
anthropology, optimal psychology, and then, you know, quite often adventure leadership
fun things to do in the wild and backcountry and mountains and oceans. And we get to work
with everybody from, you know, executives at companies like Google and Deloitte and
Disney and Lululemon and places like that, but also privileged to work with some of the
tier one special operations community in the world, the SAS and Santos Military Academy
in the UK, as well as SEAL Team 6 and Dev Group here in the US, and really always just
curious about what makes us come alive, what lets us feel and perform at our best. And
then fundamentally kind of almost back to the old school Greeks, you know, what is a
good life well lived. And that inquiry has also led to me writing a couple of books.
One was called Stealing Fire, and that was really trying to sort of trace and track the
multi-thousand year history of ecstatic cultures, like those communities of practice that have
sought and made the most of non-ordinary states of being. And again, that goes all the way
back to one of Socrates' senior students stealing the psychedelic brew from the Lucidian
Mysteries and throwing a house party in Athens, which was kind of a wonderfully weird and
funny story, risking life and banishment, you know, to do so, all the way to contemporary
expressions like Burning Man and other situations. And then most recently, I wrote a book called
Recapture the Rapture, Rethinking God, Sex and Death in a World that's Lost its Mind.
And really that one is just to say, hey, where are we going as a civilization? Feels like
we're in kind of a tight spot. Seems like we're going to need to get much better at
processing our grief at skillful and responsible accessing of peak states and connecting to
each other in resilient, anti-fragile ways that don't end up in the ditch of dysfunctional
or cultic communities. So how do we do this thing is fundamentally the ongoing inquiry?
And what are some ways to have, you know, to have as meaningful and purposeful and healthy
and happy and joyful lives as we can along the way?
Oh, that's all brilliant. And I'm excited to dive deep. But first, I think I need to
stop you and have you tell that story about the Illusinian Mysteries. Oh, I've been really
fascinated with that whole ritual, the psychedelic brew. And so somebody stole the brew?
Yeah, it's such a crazy story. And I actually shared it with a friend, Brian Mororescu,
who wrote the immortality change kind of right, which blew up and expanded the story,
which was fundamentally, I mean, Brian, Brian's new contribution is the, what does he call it,
the archaeochemistry or something, but basically actually the fine grain scraping of the pots
and things to see what was actually in them versus just the written record. But he was
really just dusting off Ruck and Wasson's thesis from way back in the day about the
potential LSA, you know, ergot fungus as the actual psychoactive kicker in the Greek Illusinian
Mysteries. But what's so interesting about the Illusinian Mysteries is they persisted
for 2,000 years. You know, you're like, holy shit, like what cultural anything continues
for 2,000 years. And here's one of the wilder and woollier state experiences. And this is
Plutarch and Cicero and Plato and arguably all the way back to Pythagoras and the Presocratics,
like there was some serious juju coming out of this over a week long ritual with sleep
deprivation and chanting and pageantry and costumes and all these other kind of state
shifting technologies, but then also Kukion, this arguably quite credibly psychoactive brew.
And if you were an initiate into the mysteries, you weren't allowed to share it or talk about
it on pain of death. And so about 20 years ago, I was doing research and I just remember
this random little snippet of an account from sort of Plato's era of a court case about
someone having stolen the Kukion and then making use of it. And so in the writing of
Stealing Fire, I was like, oh, I remember that. I've got to get back to that, dust it off,
see what it was. The story was actually even better than I remembered. It turned out it was
Alcibiades, who was this like rascal of a senior student of Socrates and potentially they were
lovers. So he was kind of his like chicken boy, you know, slash, like sketchy teacher-student
relationships. But Alcibiades himself was a rascal. He then steals it. He ends up throwing
a huge house party with the magic potion. So this is not that different than like Silicon
Valley billionaires going to Burning Man, you know, and blowing the roof off the thing,
he then gets ratted out by some rivals. And he ends up then betraying Athens. He's like
this crazy double crosser, all sorts of things. He ends up actually, I just read two weeks
ago, I think he ends up getting murdered in the end. But like his story is absolutely
off the charts. So that idea that, you know, we often think of ancient things as very kind
of stuffy and respectable, you know, and buttoned down. And that was the way they did things
back in the past. And if we want to be respectable, we should do things more like they did, not
how we do now. And then you kind of realize this was almost identical. And it was literally
like, it was was it 22,000 or 2,500, whatever it was, it was almost to the day, an anniversary
of when Ken Kesey was at Stanford University, unbeknowingly, taking MK Ultra, you know, the
government PsyOps projects, taking their LSD as part of a medical study and stealing it
out of the cabinets and taking it back to Stanford and lighting up all of the, you know,
this was Larry McMurtry, the writer, this was at Abbey Wallace Stegner, you know, all
these like literary giants were there. And they were literally like early sixties, getting
lit up with exactly the same process, stealing fire, stealing the psychedelic magic. And
then that booted up and turned on everything from the Grateful Dead is their house band.
They were just a bunch of funky musicians in Palo Alto at the time. They pioneered psychedelic
rock, which is now happening at the sphere in Las Vegas with John Mayer taking Jerry
Garcia's place, you know, one of the largest grossing acts to this day over the last five
years is still that lineage, as is all the Silicon Valley from the Homebrew Computer Club,
all the way to the imaginings of AR and VR, all the way into the entire Burning Man culture
and community goes back to Ken Guzzi stealing that government asset and throwing a house party.
So the parallels are just, you know, you couldn't make up. And I think they are, they are fascinating
because there's always that question of, can you bottle lightning without getting burned?
You know, is there something that is tricksy? Is there something squirrely? Is there something
inherently unstable and therefore kind of not scalable, right, about these experiences and
also about the utterly predictable backlashes that they almost always seem to precipitate. And
even just last week, right, we had the maps, FDA clinical trials, getting the hard breaks,
and the committee voting 10 to one against approving it because there's been a lot more
scrutiny and a lot more attention. This was MDMA, right? This was for the MDMA trial. This is a
40 year effort. And it's right there at the goal line. And potentially getting, excuse me,
and potentially getting sidelined. And Jesus, I'm going to grab a drink. Yeah, yeah, no problem.
All good. You are on fire right now. I am loving the pace of this podcast.
Great. This is just me on normal settings. So we can play however you want.
So the MDMA studies. So the MDMA studies and the FDA's oversight committee basically had to
sift through, there was a petition and a kind of a complaint that, hey, things were a little
fast and loose here with this, with this, you know, taking this drug to market and moving through
all the phases of the trials. And one of the comments really struck me, which was one of the
most significant concerns was, hey, by the way, we've heard that this MDMA, one of the known
side effects is euphoria. And that's concerning because euphoria means it has a high potential
for abuse. And you think now, wait a second, this is the same FDA that Greenlit, Adderall, and
Ritalin, basically we've had, you know, and just in the last 18 months even, there's been a published
report being like, oh yeah, by the way, all you parents that were talked into putting your
little developmental kids on amphetamines for their adolescence and neurological development,
there is no correlation between them, between that and them doing any better in academic outcomes.
They just kind of slipped that one into the news cycle like, sorry, kids, 30 years of creating
little speed freaks, and it wasn't even going to help them get into college. Right. So we did that.
We did Celebrex, which turned out to be a huge, the largest settlement, class action settlement on
killing people with a drug. What was Celebrex? Pardon? What is Celebrex? Well, gosh, now I've
been, let me think, it might even be worth doing. Celebrex, it sounds familiar. So Celebrex, it might,
what is the largest pharma settlement? It could be another one of those.
It says Celebrex is used to treat pain and redness, swelling and heat inflammation.
Oh, Vioxx. Vioxx. Thank you. Right. We did Vioxx. We definitely did oxycontin,
you know, and all of those drugs made it just fine through the process. But we are having real
issues and hyperscrutinizing, one that also has euphoria. And HL Makin was that famous kind of
very funny newspaper publisher back in the early 20th century. I think he said Protestantism,
you know, and he said the definition of Protestantism is that sneaking suspicion
that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And so you can see like all the way back to
Alcibiades back in ancient Greece and being taken to task for outing the mysteries, which,
you know, fair cop, those were the road rules. Right. But nonetheless, it was fun enough,
whatever that experience was, it was fun enough. He wanted to steal the magic brew for a house
party all the way to Keezy in the early 60s at Stanford, unwittingly interacting with MKUltra,
the Mind Control government project that Stranger Things is based on. Right. All the way to our
current situation where we have MDA running up against FDA concerns about they might be having
a little too much fun and we need to put those extra extra screws to them. So for me, that's
you can boil it almost down to so what is that dynamic through through the ages is the sort of
ongoing battle between the priests and the Prometheans. You know, there's always the
priest class and they start out, you know, wearing black cassocks. Now they're the shiny
men in black, the feds. Right. But it's still those in control of the status quo and the norms
who are who are empowered to police consciousness. And then the honest to God Prometheans. Right.
I mean, all the way back to the ancient myth. Right. Prometheus is like, Hey, Daddy Zeus.
It seems like there's a bunch of cold, starving, shivering little monkeys down there and I'm
taking pity on them. Can we help them out? And Zeus is like, hell no. If we did, they'd get too
epiti for their own good. Right. And Prometheus is like, All right, well, I'm going to do this
anyway. My heart bleeds for them. Right. He's kind of an, he's almost like a Hellenic Christ
figure. Right. And he's like, Okay, so I'm going to do this on behalf of them. And he doesn't just
bring them fire. He brings them civilization, technology, pottery, language, medicine, all of
it. Right. And then there's hell to pay. Right. And so we see that that oscillating
dynamic that the Prometheans find the juice, wherever it is, wherever it's been buried,
wherever it's been hidden, wherever it's been locked up, they free it. And there's almost
always these explosive renaissance is right celebrations, rocking good parties. And then
that starts giving you know, then other people start finding out about it. It draws attention.
And then invariably gets shut down. And the real tell is the extreme prejudice with which
it gets shut down. You know, it's not, Hey guys, cool, cool it off. You know, turn down the music
by 11, you know, make sure you clean up when you're done. It is, it is like literally the most
aggressive and violent reactive repression you could possibly imagine. And it so it seems like,
Yeah, that, that, that ain't shall make him quote that idea of that, you know, the sneaking
suspicion that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And even last year with when
Burning Man got, you know, rained out. And it was, I think, arguably the first year of that event
where the people at just because of enough starlings on site, right, there was a it became the
first extremely online burn in history. Because in the past, you used to schlep it out to the
desert, you were completely unplugged and out of touch for, you know, a week to two weeks,
depending on how long you were there. And you were out of contact with all civilization, that was part
of the magic and the mystery of it. This was an extremely online burn. And you had all the
haters, and you had the New York Post, and you had crazy tiktokers, and you had all right wing
nuts on Telegram talking about how this was a federal, this was Operation Mockingbird or
whatever, you know, and then they were going to inject everybody with Ebola, you had people
weighing in like that, you had people being like, Oh, look, there's Chris Rock, and, you know,
you know, and, and, and Tiesto, and here's the cool DJs. And, and then you had people
at Burning Man, also reading these things, and then also commenting. And, and the amount of
psychic energy that was devoted to making sense of what was a few rainy days was completely out of
proportion with that and being a NASCAR race, or a football stadium, or, you know, a stamp
collector's convention or anything. And so it is, I think, super interesting that how we hold
notions of bliss, pleasure, joy, liberation directly affect our, our willingness, our tolerance,
our curiosity, and our positioning, because radical, whatever, you know, radical joy, radical
awareness, radical freedom is rarely in a vacuum and rarely without other people having strong
opinions about how it can and should go down. Well, I love everything you just said. I have
quite a few thoughts. My first thing is I don't want to make this about me, but at Burning Man,
Brian Morescu went there and people were very inspired by the video we made together on the
Elucidian Mysteries and the Great Psychedelic Secret and that whole ritual. So they built an
entire section of Burning Man based on the idea that if you die before you die, you don't die.
And that was written on this giant cup. It was massive. That was the Kukion cup. And they took,
I don't know, like 10,000 drones, and they put them up in the sky and they programmed them to create
the images that I had drawn in our video, which just blew my mind. It blew my mind. This was
funded by the Musk family. It was a Kimble and Christiana. Right. Yeah, I don't know them, but
I was just, when I saw the pictures of the drones making this DNA tree that I love to draw, I was
like, that's insane. So that's one thing you reminded me of, which I think is really cool how
the secret of the Elucidian Mysteries, it still lives on and it still captivates us.
And then one thing you made me think of is, can humans handle these very potent, powerful
substances without these ancient rituals attached to them? It seems like if you just
take all the barriers down and you just give people these really powerful agents,
sometimes they can't handle them. And you look at cities that have made all drugs legal
and it kind of didn't work in some ways. You can't give people ultimate freedom without
accountability. Have you seen that? Yeah, but I think to quote the great philosopher Homer Simpson,
he was like, short answer, yes with an and, long answer, no with a but. I mean, the bottom line,
there's a couple of things. If you're referring specifically to current U.S. cities efforts like
Portland and Oregon and those kind of things and even Vancouver and then those those sort of things
to decriminalize drugs, you could also potentially look to Portugal and a few other places in the
world. You know, I think it's essential to differentiate or disambiguate between different
classes of chemicals because they are radically different in their in both impact, user experience,
prosocial white indoor health benefits or detriments. So the fact that folks were trying to
do that, especially in North America, you know, in the last decade, and quite and in the midst of
both a quarantine lockdown crisis of public and mental and social health, as well as an opioid,
you know, starting with oxy, going into street heroin, going into fentanyl, you're like, okay,
those are not that's not a cognitive liberty argument. And in fact, I was on stage speaking
of Benningman, I was giving a talk at maps with Rick Doblin and Carl. Gosh, what is Carl's last name?
Hart? Carl Hart. Yes. Carl Hart, right? Who is who is that? I believe he's at Columbia. And he is
a very strong cognitive libertarian, basically, the idea that people should be free to consume
anything they'd like. He's also quite infamously, as he, you know, wrote in his own books, a high
functioning opioid user. So, you know, the thing there is like you can, you know, motivated reasoning,
there is an element where he's like, of course, you're going to argue to be left alone to do the
thing that you like to do, and may or may not be able to, you know, stop or start at will, right?
But the urban situations does lead you to question how safe, stable, pro-social are
accessed to these tools and techniques. I've written in like my last book, a sort of a suggested model
of social psychedelic use, which would be a bell curve. And basically, 10% of the population,
those with family histories of Doctriad, personality, so narcissism, Machiavellianism,
sociopathy, authoritarianism, schizophrenia, you know, borderline personality, any number of
situations where like, hey, your medical and or family history does not suggest this is a good
role of the dice, so don't, right? That 10%, take those folks out. 10% only, only 10% of the
population should probably ever do them more than one, two or three times in their entire life.
And those could be sort of the psychonauts, test pilots, the cultural creators, whatever those people
are that self-select and are willing to kind of learn and apprentice to the skill sets. And then,
you know, the overwhelming majority in the middle, what would it look like to do what you suggested,
which is reintegrate these state experiences within a initiatory cultural ritual framework,
a.k.a. the anthropology, the neuroanthropology of it. And you can make a case then if you're like,
okay, well, how have civilizations, how have societies made use of hardship or deal,
initiation and access to transcendence, vision quests, rights of passage, all those kind of
things. So you can make a case, hey, first one kind of makes sense. And the right of passage from
adolescence to adulthood, right, that great, very famous book by Alex Haley that then became,
I think, the most watched miniseries ever roots, right, which was about the African diaspora and
the slave trade. But back in Ghana, I think it was, you know, Kuntakinte is the lead, you know,
he's the kind of the hero that makes his way through the story. But as a baby, he is born
in West Africa and his father holds him up to this incredible Milky Way night sky. And he says,
behold, Kuntakinte, the only thing in the universe greater than you. Right. And it's this
beautiful like, like, like welcome to the world kind of moment. And here's your place in things.
Here's your place against the vast and the infinite, the Milky Way, the night sky,
here's your place in your family, here's your place in your community. And so picturing that,
you know, fast forward 15 years, picturing that as our initiation for young men and young women
into adulthood, because right now we've got failure to launch, we've got kids at kicking
the can down the road on an extended adolescence, right, until they're 30, which is, I think,
arguably, a little too long. You know, it's like, I'm just going to smoke weed and jerk off to porn
and play first person shooter games in my parents' basement, and then become an angry incel, you
know, because I don't have a snatched jawline like all the chads who are snagging all the Stasis,
you're like, that's wildly dysfunctional. You know, and so what we need are you need
moments of effective initiation that actually are transformational. They're not as Michael
Pollan called them placebo sacraments, right, you actually need the real deal. So that if I pass
through that threshold, I am no longer the same person, my relationship and obligation to the
world is not the same. So authentic initiatory rights of passage. And folks have been talking
about that, that's not a particularly profound insight, it's just pronounced and how absent they
are. And the next one could arguably be marriage, right. So picture, you know, and if you wanted to
get really down into the details and programming, right, you could be like, oh, that initiatory
right of passage could be three grams of psilocybin, or it could be a functional ayahuasca
experience or something along those lines, right, slow enough, not acutely intense enough to just
scramble you, you know, like DMT or like five MEO or something like something along those lines,
but you know, a real, you know, like the world's enchanted and magical, you know, and I'm being
and seeing that, right. So that that that is an initiatory process for partners and couples. And,
you know, maps has been parallel tracking this, which is MDMA as couples therapy. So imagine if,
you know, instead of sort of sitting with your rabbi or sitting with your priest or whoever the
sort of minister of your ceremony would be beforehand as a young couple, you know, like a happy
couple to be, what are you guys going to do? What are your commitments? What are your obligations?
What might it be like for them to take MDMA together? And with some form of guidance or
facilitation, right, it could just simply be loving friends and family, it could be a minister,
it could be whatever, to actually speak their deepest hopes and fears for and their pledging
of their love for each other in a way that marriage then became that communion, not simply,
oh, we got a Williams and Sonoma guest list, and please make sure we get enough linens to
match our silverware, you know, and there we are, you know, doing our destination wedding for the
Graham, you know, like all of these super hyper superficial things that don't carry you through
the doldrums, don't carry you through the, we've got two kids under the age of three and we've been
sleepless for six months and I, you know, and I don't even know who I am anymore, let alone who
you are anymore, and this doesn't feel fun anymore, you know, and couples just drifting
under the burden of being householders together, which is, you know, which is an unmitigated son
of a bitch, if you don't have, you know, the other things that come with deep connection
and potential communion. And then the obvious final one is just end of life. What might it mean?
There I am, you know, sliding off this mortal coil and really whatever, you know, I mean,
there's so many stories of either staunch atheists who then get religion at the end, you know, or
devout believers who then doubt everything or whatever it might be, but basically facing
the reaper is a great equalizer on whatever worldviews or philosophies you played through,
you know, the rest of your life with. And an experience like, and again, this is all wildly
open to interpretation and curation, but, you know, an experience like 5MDMT, which many
participants do report, is as close as anyone can imagine to a near-death experience of sort of,
you know, brilliant white light encounter with source consciousness. You're like, oh, okay,
many people who have had that experience prior to dying explicitly go out of their way to mention,
I'm no longer so afraid of my physical death. I know what's on the other side. I've had a quick
sneak peek preview. And so imagine that and not just by itself, like, oh, let's just get Grandpa
loaded, you know, and put him in front of some, you know, immersive VR and see what happens,
but much more like, hey, Grandma, Grandpa, here is this sacred experience you get to peek
around the corner of where your path is going soon. And then you get to come back and now,
potentially with guided therapy with, you know, again, family facilitation, what is it that you'd
like to share? What are the places to make amends? What are the truths you want to pass on to your
grandchildren? What are the heartfelt things you want to share with your own kids? You know,
and so we could really reintegrate disassociated teens and bring them across the threshold into
adulthood, partnership and union, which, you know, you don't have to be a sort of card carrying
conservative to just acknowledge that, hey, as parents come together to make more children and
further our nation, our communities, our species, having them be happy and connected is generally
a better thing than having them alienated and fragmented. And then end of life. And I mean,
you know, and baby boomers have kind of led the way every, every stage of their own development,
you know, the famous kind of me generation, you know, when they were young, they were all
about personal growth and development and transcendence. And then they were in their middle
years and they were all about making bank and, you know, money and kind of Wall Street greed is
good kind of thing. And now they're, they're, they're shuffling off the coil. So there's naturally,
this is a great time to revisit our end of life rituals and ceremonies and compared to,
hey, grandma or grandpa, we found them off to a nursing home five years ago, because they just
got too difficult, you know, and now we are paying exorbitant amounts of money to these companies
who hire minimum wage employees who dope grandma and grandpa to the gills, you know, on sedatives,
you know, whatever it is to keep them docile and manageable. And they die, you know, and we maybe
we guiltily, you know, obligingly show up around their bed when it's when the time is getting
really close, but they're often out of it. And they die under fluorescent lights hooked up to
tubes and you're like, Oh my God, like we can do so much better than that. Just just from a heartfelt
human sense, but also even just from sort of clinical and therapeutic outcomes sense. So that to me
would be a really meaningful wrapper that culturally and interrelationally and communally,
we sort of can and ought to include in these peak states and experiences because the downside of the
maps medicalization model, which was a very, you know, strategic tactical thing, which is like,
let's make this respectable, let's make this legit, let's go through all the proper channels and let's
speak in the language of mainstream dominant society. So they actually understand and can
validate what we believe is to be true and precious about these experiences, aka PTSD, depression,
smoking, smoking cessation, anxiety, right? All the, all the kitchen sink stuff that has been
laid at the feet of the psychedelic experience. And instead be like, look, guys, those, those are
epiphenomena. You know, those are little bells and whistles that may or may not be improved by an
encounter with the numinous. But can we actually just sort of let the mystery stay the mystery?
Can we actually just say, hey, these experiences seem to somewhat reliably gain us access to
non-ordinary states of being where there is a certain sacredness, suchness, magic, mystery,
you know, insight, delight, aesthetic appreciation, you know, take your pick as to which of those things,
you know, you want to hang your hat on and then just say, hey, we can't and we shouldn't
try and pin that down to the 17th decimal place. That kills it, you know. And it reminds me of
that. There's an old joke, I think, I think Mark Twain used to tell it, but like, probably not,
because this is too, too recent a story that the plot is there's a biologist checking to see
how far frogs, frogs can jump. And he gives them different commands. And he's like, oh, a frog,
you know, a frog, when given the command to jump will jump 10 centimeters. And then he takes an
exacto knife, you know, a little scalpel, lops off one leg. And he's like, and then when I gave
the frog another command to jump, yeah, he only jumped seven and a half centimeters. And then
he chopped off another leg and gave him the command to jump. And he only jumped five centimeters.
And then, you know, I cut off his final leg and gave him the command to jump and nothing happened.
So I now conclude that a frog with no legs is deaf. And you do, and you kind of think that's
sort of how our, you know, again, big pharma, double blind, placebo controlled,
DSM five, correlate psychedelic research is, you're like, do you guys know even what you're
looking at? Or are you all pretending that there is not this magical mystical
initiatory experience behind those doors? And we're just sort of all sort of that that's that's
the, in some respects, that's the, that's the scam is we're all pretending that there's no magic
and mystery there. And if we all stay on that hymn book of like incongruity, such and such, such
and such in conjunction with clinical therapy, you know, is going to result in all of these outcomes.
But it's a little like that, you know, Hunter Thompson's fear and loathing in Las Vegas,
you know, like, you know, we were somewhere outside of Boston when the drugs began to kick
in, right. And then famously, they're driving along that Cadillac and then they pick up the
hitchhiker, you know, and Hunter's peeking. And he's like, when are we going to tell him about
the bats? You know, don't worry, the poor bastard will see him soon enough himself, you know, and
you kind of feed that to me. That's, that's the shadow side of the conventional pharmacological
medicalization and VC corporate, you know, experience of this quote unquote, psychedelic
renaissance is we're going to get Prozac Nation 2.0 with new and improved five HT2A receptor sites,
you know, versus anything, but just imagine if 30 years ago, we'd gone down the religious liberty
route and had said, hey, placebo sacraments suck, you know, and we as humans deserve cultural
communal encounters and renewal for healing and inspiration of the mystery. And that's our
best right. No, I deserve a copay for a coded illness for my worried wellness of tired, wired,
stressed and anxious. And I've heard that this new magic pill might allow me to keep going as one
more how slightly better adjusted cog in the neoliberal machine. Wow, you just said a lot of
things that are that kind of I'm going to have to sit and reflect on everything you just said
and rewatch that clip because that yeah, well said, well said. And I got it down quite a few
notes, but I think on a on a grand level, you made me think of this progress narrative that we've
been given that if you're really materialist in your thinking, things are just getting better and
better and better. We have more stuff. Everybody has a bigger flat screen TV. They often point to
metrics like life expectancy is longer, child infant mortality is lower. Look at all our pharmaceuticals,
look at our health industry, look at how much food people have. And they say that's a progress
narrative. Is that progress narrative a lie? Yeah, I mean, that's such a good question. That's
literally the subject of my next book. And I'm so I'm deep into the research right now. And
I mean, I think the only honest answer and I actually had this conversation
with Daniel Schmackenberger several years ago, it just hasn't, you know, the foundational
conditions are the same, which is is that for most of us right now, it's bafflingly confusing
to figure out kind of quote unquote, what's really going on. Because when you do see Hans
Rosling or Steven Pinker or, you know, pick your favorite Ted talk, you're like, Oh, my gosh,
you know, this is the most peaceful we've ever been. This is the most people living above the
poverty line. This is, you know, just the litany of public health statistics that are suggesting
this is the best of times. And then you end up either on an environmental channel or just
doom scrolling your newsfeed. And you become very quickly convinced, Oh, no, we are going off the
cliff with no skid marks, you know, to our doom, and we probably deserve it. You know, like, look
how many dumb, terrible, stupid ass things we're doing, we deserve what's coming. Like, and so
things are getting exponentially worse and getting exponentially better at precisely the same moment.
And oh, by the way, this super advanced techno industrial society with pronounced civil liberties
and incredible hyper mobility and access to the world's information, you know, is also the very
same container that is allowing us to do all these personal growth and healing and waking up
experiences. Right. And so you sort of you wake up and then you're like, Oh, my God, wait, when did
I wake up? I woke up now in this moment. I mean, I had that experience going skiing in Colorado
a few years ago. And it was a spring skiing and we rolling into town and everything was melting.
Right. And it was early, like it was it felt like May and it was actually mid March. And, you know,
there was muddy waters down the streets and there was grass and straw showing around, you know, and
there we are riding this lift and they just, you know, having lived most of our life in Colorado
and knowing the history of the ski industry, you're like, Holy shit. So I'm riding this lift
and I'm watching everything melt around us and being like, Hmm, I don't know how much longer
the ski industry is going to be a thing. And then thinking, Wow, this ski industry was the direct
byproduct of the military industrial complex. The 10th Mountain Division had trained just over
the hills from us. They went to Italy fought on the Alps. They all came back from the Alps,
started Veil started Aspen started Sun Valley. Right. The skis we the skis and snowboards we
ski on have advanced petrochemical P text bases that are super slidey with metal edges and all
these things when flex patterns and all this kind of stuff that the lifts and all the steel and
all the all the things. Right. The very techno industrial warmongering society that made this
possible of like little monkeys sliding down white stuff in the mountains for fun is also the
very thing that's also melting this planet's atmosphere. Right. And so that was just a tiny
example of what we're experiencing globally and at scale right now, which is that our awareness
has gone through the roof at the same time that what we need to be paying attention to or be
made aware of is that the very same culture that has birthed us is also threatening to kill us.
And most people can't hold that cognitive dissonance. So we toggle between the coming alive arc of
like what's the infinite, you know, what's my hashtag best life? What's my optimum personal
growth? What's the way do I want to go? Who do I want to be unlimited possibilities and then also
societally, you know, what is a world where any gender is welcome? What is a world of post-racial
equality? What is a you know, what is a realm where the bottom four billion of the global
south have equity and inclusion and we've made reparations for all the dirty, dirty deeds
over the last 500 years, etc. Right. So that's that's the coming alive arc. And it's sort of,
it's not time bound and it's not resource dependent. It's a sort of infinite open,
what's the best thing we can possibly imagine and live into. And then that gets clipped by the
staying alive arc, which is very time bound and very resource constrained. And it's like, oh,
shit, you know, should I have my money in fiat or crypto? Should I get a, should I get an, you know,
a golden passport in Portugal, you know, or maybe I've heard that St. Kitts is dishing them out?
Or do I need to get down to Mexico? Or do I hunker down in the US? Or do I flee to Canada?
Right. Or those kinds of things. Or like, what do we do right with the best places on the maps?
I mean, a buddy of ours was, was it was an SVP at Google, who got super freaked out during,
I think it was the 2018 California fires. Or maybe it was later than that actually,
because it was during COVID, it was that super dystopian situation where families were like
fleeing San Francisco to get to Tahoe, where they could see sky and their kids could breathe again
in the midst of a pandemic with masks on, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is, you know,
this is bleak, right? That waked him out to the point where he's like, Okay, California's
off my list. I'm moving my family somewhere to be safe. And he did all the research being,
you know, an engineering quanti guy with the world's best search engines at his fingertips.
And he concluded that Lahaina Maui was the safe place on an island in the middle of the Pacific
in a tropical rainforest. And that's where he was going to post up. And he got clipped,
right with the Lahaina fires, which, you know, kind of reminds me of the, there's again,
an old Greek story of someone going to the Oracle at Delphi. And being told, tomorrow you will,
you will die. And he flees Athens for Sparta. He's like, Oh, fuck that noise. I'm getting out of
dodge. And then runs into the Reaper in a crowd in Sparta. And he's shocked. And he's like, What
are you doing? And he's like, I was waiting for you. So that notion for all of us these days,
that there's sort of, there is no a way. And it's on us to pick our spot to make our stand.
And then get on with living through this feels like an important part of how do we reconcile that
impossible contradiction of things are exponentially better and worse at the same time? And where do
I even map that? Right? I mean, I think if you think if you've heard, in fact, I guess people
have heard of it, because it's called the three body problem is isn't that that the new HBO show,
right? With the Game of Thrones guys, I think it is. But anyway, the three body problem
refers to in astronomy slash physics. It's very, very hard to map and model. It's one thing to
map like the moon going around the earth. But when you throw in the sun and the moon and the earth
and where all things are in relationships to each other, it gets herdy, goody in a hurry.
And we've got an eight billion body problem. All agentic little egos bouncing around each other.
How on earth we map them leads to cognitive shorting out, leads to emotional psychological
overwhelm, and leads to boatloads of grief, as we potentially run all the traps, run the numbers,
and come to the conclusion that the world as we have known it might not actually be as stable or
foreordained or given or even, you know, predictably carrying forwards as we might have thought,
as we might have hoped, as we might have been led to believe. So how do we grieve in all of this?
Also, you know, in a healthy way, you know, in a powerful way, in a way that leaves us cleansed
and grounded and stronger and wiser, versus in a way that leaves us kicking and screaming and
embittered and feeling victimized, feels like a super important part of what, you know,
what life might look like going forward or kind of part of the immune, our immune systems,
that will be really helpful for us to develop.
Well, part of that progress narrative is that technology is going to save us,
and that's going to be our get out of jail free card. Do you think that we could develop
some technology that fixes all our problems? Yeah, I mean, Mark Andreessen, right, of Andreessen
Horowitz, you know, famously, infamously wrote the techno optimist manifesto last year,
and he was basically coming down hard on the side of technology progress is it has always been
with God knows what's got us out of the last pickle. It is forever will be. And anybody who
isn't for utterly unregulated effect, you know, the term that sort of showed up on Twitter is
effective accelerationism, right, instead of effective altruism, right, the idea of just like
pin it. Let's put every penny and every calorie and every gigawatt we've got into
general artificial intelligence, basically a silicon God, and that'll fix it. Which, you know,
if anybody's seen, you read the stories of Dr. Faustus or seen Fantasia with Mickey and the
Sorcerer's apprentice, you know, or any countless, countless tale where humans are tempted to go for
ultimate power or knowledge, right, and they try and grab for that ring, you know, there's not a
single story where that one comes up roses. So there's a lot in our kind of mythical memory,
as well as our historical memory of, you know, all we ever do is kick the can down the road to
greater, more complex, wicked problems from solving our earlier ones. You know, and some of the
classics would be, oh, you know, London fog, right? London fog was because we were burning too much
coal, and then we discovered, you know, quote unquote, cleaner, burning diesel and hydrocarbons,
fossil fuels, actually liquid fuels, that was much better. London fog as a pollution went away.
The, you know, New York and Chicago and Paris and London were, you know, in the 1890s were up to their
kneecaps and horseshoes of all the carriages, and then Henry Ford invented the Model T. See, look,
we keep doing this, right? And so there are these really well worn tropes about what is our direction,
does, is there a teleological thrust, meaning is there a point or a purpose to where we're going,
and then all the stories of progress are, yes, it's high into the right, right, the curve goes up,
and we're on times arrow, it's going someplace, which really wasn't, you know, wasn't arguably,
that is a highly Judeo-Christian concept, right? It's not until the Hebrew and Christian sacred
scriptures had an alpha and had an alpha, in the beginning was the word and the word was good,
right? And an omega, an endpoint that we actually got to have connect two dots on a line and create
times arrow. Now, there's all sorts of reasons, Elia Prigogene, the Nobel laureate and physics
and others have, you know, played with, you know, what is the notion of times arrow, not just as a
cultural story, but as potentially a deep code of physical reality, a.k.a. you can't unscramble
an omelet, those kind of things, there's certain appearances of directionality that breaks down
at a quantum level. And Prigogene actually had another really meaningful contribution to this,
so just to be clear, so we're talking about Mark Andreessen posting something on, you know,
effective altruism, or effective accelerationism, we're talking about the sort of tried and true
progress narrative, and now we're kind of kicking it down to, well, what's true at the base levels
of reality? And Prigogene advanced this notion of complex dissipative structures, and that a complex
dissipative structure could be a human, like we talking, breathing, loving, writing poetry,
doing whatever, we're far more complex than the 28 minerals and elements that make up our bodies,
right? And when we die, we go back to decomposing and pushing up daisies, and that is a less complex
state than we were when we were alive. So a human is a complex dissipative structure,
when we need constant inputs of energy, a.k.a. food and water, or we die, right? And that's
the dissipating part. And so are civilizations, and the more complex our civilizations get,
the more energy they need to keep them going without collapsing. And of course, as we're
contemplating for the first time in human history, a transition from burning ever denser carbon,
right? In fact, Wes Jackson, who is at the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas, he's one of the great
kind of environmental and ecologists. He's a sort of contemporary of Wendell Berry.
He said something interesting. He said, basically, you can make a case that all of human civilization
is just the hunt for ever denser carbon and ever hotter fire, right? So from like,
rubbing sticks together, you know, just burning up trees and twigs and that kind of stuff,
to ceramics and kilns, like now we can actually cure Earth in a waterproof,
bugproof storage container for our grains. So now we can take starlight in the form of photosynthesis
and grain production, and we can bend time, right, by keeping it in pots. And then the
bronze age, oh my gosh, if we dig up some of this stuff, we'd dig up tin and copper,
and we put it in a hot enough fire, we can make bronze, that's amazing. We have swords and poke
people and beat the shit out of the people that don't have sharper, pokey things. And so then,
and you get into the iron age, oh my gosh, even better. And then all the way into the silicon age,
we can melt sand, turn it into glass, turn it into lenses, turn it into silicon ships,
but at 1500 degrees, right, all the way to like the Large Hadron Collider, where we have the light
and heat of our sun. So we're forever hunting hotter fire, to heat ever more dense and interesting
star stuff, to our own benefit and advantage. Which, back to Prigogene, and the notion of
complex dissipated structures, right, is the idea that he makes the case, and other
physicists and writers who've kind of built on his work since, is that our complexity,
our civilization, all the cool stuff that we like to think of as, you know, human,
isn't actually random. It's actually a very, very elegant way of the universe reconciling
the second law of thermodynamics, aka all things tend to entropy over time. Because if you're in
that camp, you're like, oh, we're just, we're just random fluctuations, we shouldn't be here,
roll the dice a million times more, and we wouldn't be here, right? There is no point or
purpose, we're an accident of randomized genetic mutation, right? There's definitely that camp,
right? Prigogene would say, hey, yes, it's true that the universe tends towards the heat, you know,
heat death, right, and a complete unspooling of all order and complexity over time, but wouldn't
you know it? A complex dissipated structure is actually the universe's best way to get to entropy
in the end. So if you take an example of like, if there's, if, you know, your bathtub is filled
with water, and then it needs to drain all the way to daylight, you know, through your basement,
through your pipes, out to the stream or the river, right? Well, what does it do? It creates a whirlpool,
which is a complex dissipated structure. It is one of the best ways to take an energy gradient
of a ton of water, resisting gravity, you know, high to all the water going low and draining out.
What's the best thing? Create a whirlpool to migrate it, the same thing with hurricanes,
right? You've got a low pressure and a high pressure system, you've got someplace that's
really cold and dense, and you've got someplace that's hot and light, and if it's powerful enough,
what does it do? It creates that giant whirlpool situation, and it mixes, right? It very, very
effectively mixes the energy gradient. It balances it. So if you're in that prigogene camp, you would
say, hey, we are complex dissipated structures, we are enacting, so we have a purpose, and it's a way
to reconcile the second law of thermodynamics, this all ends in the ditch, right, with the goodness,
truth, and beauty that may emerge, right, in us, and we're not just random accidents, we are actually
agents centered in the bigger and greater unfolding of universal physical and energetic
processes. So now, let's go back to, because that's just kind of like, that's a nerdy sidebar,
but I think it's super important, because if you're just dealing with, like,
warring, like, Twitter wars, like Mark Andreessen and the EX versus the de-growth or de-sell
haters and you're just in a pissing match at that level, we're not necessarily kind of taking in the
whole context and getting beyond opinions and into outlooks that are potentially rooted in
more deeply structural reality. So, right, the reality of, hey, is technology going to save us,
right, is the way forwards even faster, right, the folks that are like, again, like Mark Andreessen
has a great phrase, he said, we're teaching sand to think, right, and that's what we're doing with
artificial general intelligence, and you can make a case, like, are we just being carbon-based life
form chauvinists, is it just because we're carbon-based life forms, and everything else we
know on this planet is carbon-based, that we somehow have a prejudice, like, we're special and
unique, and we're the honest and good and true, but silicon-based consciousness is somehow an
abomination and we should prosecute it and shut it down, like, that's an interesting question,
you know, and that's where Larry Page has been, that was the rift between him and Elon,
where he was basically, you know, he accused Elon famously of being a speciesist, you know,
like you actually, you know, Sam Altman has said, in fact, he came on right after us giving a
talk at Burning Man, a couple, it was like six months before ChatGPT launched, so it was before,
you know, he, his sort of recognizability had blown up to the level it is now,
and he said basically there's only two options for humans, we either become cyborgs,
meaning we're sort of like supplemented, augmented, you know, but not just biological
people anymore, or we just become bootloaders to silicon consciousness, we're just the little
monkeys with thumbs that were just clever, just clever enough to dig up all this stuff and heat
hot fires, right, and make the silicon, and organize a bunch of buried fossil fuel starlight
and energy to pump into the grid, until, you know, silicon consciousness could boot up and say,
thanks very much, you clever little monkeys, we're now going to eliminate you, you know,
or enslave you, you know, I'll sky bot in the matrix and everything else, or sky net. Yeah, so,
so I think there's a, you know, a very practical and real question, which is, can we decouple,
like what, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow I think famously talked about conscious uncoupling,
like for divorces that don't get nasty, right, and I think for all of us there's a question of
what is conscious decoupling look like, and in this instance it's, it's can we decouple
our carbon burn, right, from our quality of life, and if we can, then we buy the time,
and the, and the options to architect a more inclusive, more creative civilizational structure,
and if we can't, then there's very real questions back to the degrowth side of the
argument, which is like, hey, no, actually look, look at us, we're, we're, we're grossly obese,
we're wildly unhappy, you know, Marie Kondo became a thing because there's, you know,
$23 billion storage industry, like we have way too much stuff, and we literally have way too
many calories hanging on our bodies, like clearly we've overshot some sweet spot, right, for quality
of life versus energy burn, even though that that, even that statement seemed is surprisingly
controversial, you'll still get slammed with being a degrowth or in a D cell and you'll be accused
of wanting to deny some poor starving, you know, grandmother in Africa or India, you know,
denying her the right for her refrigerator and cell phone and air conditioning, you know,
you're like, no, no, no, that's not what we're talking about, right, but we are saying, is there,
is there a mark we've overshot on calorie burn versus the quote unquote good life,
and can we, because many of the sort of eco optimists, and Hannah Richie is the most recent,
she's at Oxford and she just recently published a book, I think called It's Not the End of the
World, but she's a protege of Hans Rosling and Max Roser at the Our World in Data project,
you know, they're basically making the case of like, hey guys, we can have everything,
right, everybody can have, all we need to do is just heat pumps and Teslas, right, and we don't
need to back off on any of the stuff we've got, right, and also some, you know, rhetorical play to
that mother in Africa or India and giving her a chance at the good life too,
which fundamentally is their own socializations of Simon Cousnets, the Nobel Prize winning
economist who came up with GDP, but he also came up with something called the Cousnets Curve,
right, and specific subset of the Cousnets Curve is the EKC, the Environmental Cousnets Curve,
and you've definitely heard this argument, even if you didn't know that's what it was called,
it was just basically that more advanced societies pollute less, right, so that basically all of
Europe and the United States, et cetera, we're on the happy far right side of the Cousnets Curve,
and we don't have, well, we do, but we just, we're not still building as many dirty coal power
plants, we don't have people using diesel and kerosene heaters to heat their homes, or we're
going to cook their foods, et cetera, et cetera, so basically IKEA and Volvos and Teslas, good,
you know, in Western Europe and the US, and coal and kerosene, you know, in China and India,
bad, and the goal there, you silly humans, right, is to get everybody up and over the
Cousnets Curve as fast as possible, and any efforts to pump the brakes is wrong-headed,
counterproductive, destructive, and anti-human, that's typically the argument, right, now,
back to motivated reasoning, like we were talking about Karl Hart, the functioning opioid user
slash professor arguing for cognitive liberty and people getting to shoot up and do what they
want to do, we are massively motivated to accept the argument of, and that's sort of the almost
religious dogma of the Cousnets Curve, because it gives us permission to keep doing exactly what
we wanted to do anyway, right, and the realities are there have been quite a bit of, there's been
quite a bit of kind of, you know, replication studies and those kind of things on the Cousnets
Curve, it doesn't exist always, it's not a law of nature, it was most pronounced at a very specific
time and place, which was post-World War II, in Western Europe and kind of the G20 countries,
OECD, you know, North America, et cetera, it hasn't replicated in a bunch of other countries,
like in Asia and other places in the global south that have attempted it since then,
and it's wildly variable and dependent on a bunch of conditions, including are you at war or not,
like, like this war is not going to be eco-groovy ever, we burn a ton of shit and we blow up a ton
of shit and we don't care, because it's war, right, so there's a thousand reasons why the Cousnets
Curve is not a law of nature, even though it's implicit in every single pro-growth argument,
you pretty much ever hear, and up against it is Javon's Paradox, and Javon's Paradox is when
things get cheaper, you don't consume them cheaper, or better faster cheaper, you typically don't end
up with a decrease in usage and consumption, you actually end up spiking and incenting even more
consumption, so as we've done all the wind and all the solar and all the batteries and all the good
groovy stuff, right, our carbon burn right now is higher than ever, so it's basically Cousnets Curve
versus Javon's Paradox, right, can we say enough is enough, can we buy some efficiencies and bank
them, or is every innovation going to then incent even further extreme growth, and as a funny example
of that, right, I was just reading this morning that the Paris Olympics were set out to be super
groovy low carbon footprint, right, and of course they're French, and you know historically
weather's been really quite nice and mild and temperate in Paris in the summers, so they didn't
bake in air conditioning, right, to all of that, to the athlete's village, and now they've just
done a survey, every single one of the G8 countries, right, minus the host, are bringing in portable
air conditioners for their athletes because they're like, no, fuck that, we, our people cannot be
flopping around on damp sheets, you know, before their race day, they need to be in 68 degrees,
so you see this fascinating thing of like Andrew Huberman, Tim Ferriss, biohacking optimization
culture, right, you should sleep cold and dark in 68 degrees, which is awesome, right, I'm a huge,
huge fan of cold nights, but it's an incredible privilege, and the fact that France attempted
to make these Olympics as clean and groovy as possible, but in that stand has run right up
against carbon footprints, and it would have been far, and the irony is they would have been far
more eco-groovy if they'd actually baked in air conditioning properly into their builds versus
having everybody run extension cords, you know, to generators, to run little portable units,
and so just back, that's back to coming alive versus staying alive, those two arcs, coming alive,
hey, 68 degrees is your optimum sleep temp to get your uro ring best scores, and staying alive is,
oh my gosh, we're burning so much fossil fuel, we're overheating the earth.
Wow, that was brilliantly said, I love that rant, and you just, you said so many things,
and I guess one thing I wanted to mention is the changing narratives,
particularly, I can use movies as an example, I remember when I was young in the 90s,
we had movies that were about humans saving the world, it was like Armageddon, Deep Impact,
some huge comment was going to hit us, and we had to stop it, then probably about 10 years later,
I noticed a changing narrative where earth is, we've messed up earth too much, and we have to
leave and find some other home, I'm thinking of movies like Interstellar, and that seemed to be
like a common theme, I started seeing that a lot more, and then maybe about 10 years later, I noticed
movies that were really pessimistic, that humans weren't really a species worth keeping going,
so we're gonna end humans now, and we're gonna pass the torch on to something new,
and I noticed that theme, I'm also noticing a similar change in narrative with AI,
for a long time we had all these movies that made AI the villain, that it was this huge existential
threat that was gonna take humans out, now I'm starting to see some interesting movies coming
out, where AI is the good thing, and it keeps society together, and the villain is somebody
that comes and shuts that AI off, and then causes chaos, and I thought, oh that's a really
interesting like predictive programming that you're trying to instill in us, and I guess it
it makes me think that there's some sort of anti-human agenda, you mentioned that there's
this camp of people that think that we're like accidents, and I believe that that anti-human
agenda is coming from that side, are you seeing it all like an anti-human agenda?
Hmm, yeah I mean that's such a great question, and I'm a huge fan of tracking things in film,
exactly as you did, like what's the pulse, what's the zeitgeist of our moment, right, and I certainly
noticed it with Marvel comics, and even Black Panther, where you had both Thanos and Killmonger,
right, as the anti-heroes, they were the bad guys, but the bad guys were actually expressing
more of what was potentially kind of in the discourse or in our conversation than ever,
like Thanos wasn't wrong, he's like look my planet got trashed, I concluded, right, then in order to
save the universe had to kill half the people or something like that, right, therefore the Thanos
snapped, and then he got ostracized and he became the super scary bad guy, right, but he wasn't wrong,
he's like there's too many people for the carrying capacity of this ecosystem, and either we get wildly
more efficient but don't succumb to the J-Von's paradox of just getting fatter and
greedier and consuming more, right, but we actually get more efficient and consume the same, or less,
but we're not doing that, so I've got to take drastic measures to save things, but he's the
villain, and you're like eh, you had a point there, and Killmonger, who I don't quite remember his
entire narrative, but I do remember it was fundamentally a sort of contemporary Malcolm X
critique, right, there was that sense of like hey colonialism, hey racism, hey all of these things,
it's a stacked deck, and to play within the system is kind of a fool's game, I need to break the
system, and so you had many situations where the critiques of the anti-hero or the villain
are actually expressing some real things for us to reckon with, whether or not we come down
exactly where they did, it's just real issues and topics to reckon with, so to your point about
are we flawed, are we bad, you know, is there something,
I mean to me it seems very much like, you know, a simple question is, is the way forwards,
or do we need to backtrack, you know, was there somewhere where we fell from grace,
and therefore everything, if we keep going the way we've been going, we just sort of
doom to carry out our original sin, or do we need to slam on the brakes and go back
to a fork in the road that we missed somewhere, right, to get back to righteousness, to get back
to balance, to get back to whatever, and you definitely see that with like Yuval Harari's
book sapiens, and I think most people were probably just sort of, you know, overwhelmed and
bedazzled by, you know, big history, kind of take, so they just kind of took it all in, but he,
you know, he smuggles in some, you know, both totally familiar and some relatively controversial
content, which is not the least of which is, we were super groovy, this is Marshall Salem's
anthropology hypothesis back in the late 60s of like, man, the hunter-gatherer had more free time,
right, it was egalitarian societies, we were healthier, everything was groovy, and then
big time bad farming came along, right, and Harari just dusted that chestnut off and completely
rebooted it for sapiens, and everyone's like, oh yeah, and if people remember far enough back,
there was a very popular book in the 90s called Ishmael, and it was told by the point of view of
a gorilla, who was a talking gorilla, and he was basically like, all of civilization is broken down
into levers and takers, and the levers are the groovy indigenous, sustainable folks, and the
takers are the kind of, you know, beginnings of white Western capitalist patriarchy, and it resonated,
it sold millions of copies, and it was also, of course, grossly simplified, and those questions
though, right, and even in our conversations around something as heart-wrenching and politically
loaded as Gaza, and the Arab-Israeli conflict right now, is being coded in these terms,
right, so you're seeing the fact that, you know, and anti-Semitism has been a big question,
right, a big issue both in U.S. universities, like Columbia and Harvard and Penn,
as well as a bunch of other places, it's occupying tons of column inches, and it's also completely
gumming up our abilities to look clearly at a geopolitical crisis, and whose side is on what
and what's going on, because, you know, one of the things, just one second,
dude, I don't even know if I want to go into this, do you want to, I mean, it's tight, but it's just
if we want, it just depends on, this is an absolute rat's nest landmine, I'm not going
to be advocating a personal opinion on it, but I'm going to potentially just unpack
that whole tribalism, capitalism, colonialism thing, just totally recall.
That sounds great, yeah. Is that right? I mean, it sounds
like a great idea, let's hear it. Okay, so quite a bit of the, I mean, obviously,
there's a tragic humanitarian situation in Gaza right now, and in Ukraine, and in Darfur,
and in many places in the world, so Sub-Saharan Africa is on fire, there's all sorts of
sadness and loss of life happening there. Obviously, we've been tracking Ukraine for
the last couple of years, and most recently, and sort of explosively and controversially,
what's happening in Gaza. Part of the support for Palestinians has been coded as Israelis,
as colonizers, and that has then sort of activated the meme complex of social justice,
post-Marxist academic critiques in the United States. So when they get accused of antisemitism,
it's a relatively new kind of antisemitism, right? It's Jews as coded as white
hate, coded as colonizers, and colonizers are always bad, and colonized, a.k.a. Frans Fanon,
you know, and Richard of the Earth, and Blackskins, White Mask, and other academics and thinkers in
that space, and Marquis, and some others, which by the way, went straight into Ibram Kendi's
philosophy of basically the solution or response to racism is anti-racism directed at the racists,
right? So you ended up with some of those very tight arguments. So we end up with the
emergence of a new type of antisemitism, which is coding Jews, and specifically Israeli Jews,
as white, as colonizers. Now at the same time, which is very weird, because that's typically
that pro-Palestinian supporters coming from the progressive left, which has almost always been
huge supporters of ethnic diversity and inclusion, and then historically the entire American
civil rights movement in the 60s was hand in glove Jewish college students and Southern Blacks,
and that was a coalition and alliance. And on the far side, on the right,
was the Ku Klux Klan, who famously, you know, were against reconstruction and against Black
voting rights and participation in citizenship, but hot on the heels of that hit list for the Klan
were Catholics and Jews. So you're like, oh, wait a sec, now how is it that now the American
right seems to be the staunchest supporter of Israeli practices and policies, right?
When just 40-yard years ago, they were the ones who were most, most antisemitic, and that was a
totally different antisemitism, that is Jews as other. So you've got Jews as cultural other,
and this is the, you know, the protocols of the elders of Zion, this is all the classic
antisemitic tropes of Jews as separate Jews as not bowing down to our same gods and Jews as not,
not loyal to the country or the nation that they live in, etc. It's all the old school
ethnic antisemitism, right, where on the left you have political antisemitism, they're two
completely different antisemitism, right, but they still end up in the chaos. And then you think,
okay, and then in that meme complex, right, what is the sort of elephant under the rug,
or not even under the rug, right, with all coding or understanding of Jewishness? It's the Holocaust
and never again. Now you go onto the Palestinian side of the fence, and you have,
you know, what's the, what's the memetic anchor, 9-11 and ISIS, and all the way back to the Crusades,
right, but the idea of like somewhere in there you're having to respond to and either accept or reject
the notion of barbarism, of which October the 7th tragically and sadly with Hamas' activities
reinvigorated. And now you end up with, with Palestinians coded as colonized,
therefore always just in their reactions against, oh, but what about Muslim barbarism,
Samuel Huntington, clash of civilizations, Sam Harris, right, with his railing against Islam and
saying, hey, you know, Islam didn't experience a Protestant, the equivalent of a Protestant
Reformation, they're basically a medieval death cult, you know, Sam Harris has been quite adamant
on some of those points. So you can kind of see both the meme map and how the different characters
in the plots are getting coded. And it's very, very confusing because we're all running different
scripts. And so we're not even seeing the same movie anymore. And therefore coming to any kind
of humanitarian company, you know, and or, you know, governmental common ground is damn near
impossible. And the same thing is even happening in the environmental movement. I occasionally have
advised Extinction Rebellion, which was kind of, which came up with Greta Thunberg and some of those
others, they've led some of the most effective protests in 2018 to 2020. And speaking with one
of their founders, they were like, oh, well, you know, post George Floyd, post quarantine,
post all of those sort of social justice awakenings collectively, they're like, we're not going to
do anything until we've decolonized Africa. I mean, I'm paraphrasing, but it was fundamentally that.
And I just thought, oh, no, you know, like you're one, like, you're done, you're dead in the water,
like, like, like, like, you've now got way too many issues, you're just trying to solve the world's
entire pain and all injustices everywhere, while the clock is ticking on, you know, carbon and anything
else. But what's really interesting to me is, you know, and this is somewhat of a theme of our
conversation, which is waking up and paying attention to the enormity scope and scale
of the world's suffering, the consequences of our extended actions, and the potential grief
of coming to terms with kind of the triaging of what's possible and what's not.
And what is delicate, fragile, wounded, but vital to protect, preserve, mend, what is kind of already
done, it's cooked. So just basically cut our losses and don't burn more time trying to fix
something or prop something up that is fundamentally doomed. And then what is new or different or better
that we ought to, with absolute clarity and speed, get to making our building soon.
So in that, right, in our civilizational calculus, you're kind of like,
how did we end up here? And where did we go wrong? I actually had this thought watching
Darren Aronofsky, the director's, I don't know if it's his most recent, but it was a recent
documentary he did called The Territory, which is all about a relatively uncontacted tribe in
the Amazon. And it was just literally like this patch of rainforest that was their territory,
and it was shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and getting chopped on all sides.
And the first thing that blew me away about it is, you know, it was billed as, here is this
self-documentary by a sort of an uncontacted tribe, right? And so I was like, okay, this is
going to be neat. This is going to be like that Robert Neera movie, The Mission, with the Guarani
or some other tribe from centuries ago. And it wasn't. The first thing was they were all wearing
like O'Neill and Bill Among and Nike t-shirts. And you're like, oh, sweet Jesus, like there they are,
you know, wearing, of course they would dress up in their ceremonial gobb for, you know, a video
shoot or doing a ceremony, but like fundamentally they're kicking it in flip flops and, you know,
branded Western logo t-shirts. And you're like, oh my God, like that all reaches. And then they
interviewed the set, the white settlers that were being, you know, aided and abetted by Bolsonaro's
policies. And they were interviewing the younger generation of chiefs, their chief, their newly
appointed chief was like a 30 year old and he was online and tech savvy and he was part of the one
who was shooting and telling their stories. So super interesting kind of intersections of cultures.
And nobody interviewed on either side of that situation thought that they had any chance of
turning back the tide of logging, settlement, cattle farming, ranching, deforestation, you know,
and cultural assimilation, assimilation. And even last week there was a New York Times article
on a do-gooder white Christian woman, you know, for whatever it was, from Kansas or Oklahoma,
who had written a check to get 14 starlings delivered to a remote tribe. And the whole hope
was this could let them know when bad folks were coming, whether it was oil or rubber or gas or
for ranching and protect themselves, they could coordinate, they could have better medical care,
all the normal things. What happened is it completely broke their society in six months flat.
The kid, the men go all got addicted to porn. The teenagers got stuck on their phones and
stopped coming to meetings and stopped coming observing ceremonies and the grandparents were
scattered and fragmented. And at the end of all that they're like, and please don't take it away.
So that got me deeply thinking. I'm like, oh my God, what is this sort of mollic notion? What is
this giant, all devouring, all consuming beast that just seems to be unstoppable? And how enough
do we reckon with it? And what occurred to me is that, you know, capitalism is arguably one of the
one of the most efficient means of organizing matter and energy that humans have ever devised.
In the simplest sense that it just continues to outcompete all the other options. So you have to
be like, okay, there's there's there's some there there, however, but but on the other hand, look at
the social cultural ecological cost is clearly not totally right. Like there's something also deeply
off about it. In what does it relentlessly keep doing. And that's when I began to kind of inquire
into Oh, what is the what is the calculus? What is our civilizational calculus? What is the math
problem or the math equation that drives all of our behaviors? And what are we missing? You know,
is there something in this equation that it works? But it's missing key elements. And I began to
wonder, and this goes back to Gaza and the questions of antisemitism and colonialism and
coding as whiteness, this goes back to the environmental movements, and we have to decolonize
the world and all of these elements and how are we fighting? And why do we keep over consuming
like hungry ghosts? So it was the it felt to me like there were three major sort of phases. And
this is in this is kind of in order as to how they unfolded historically. But none of them have
ever unfolded in isolation from the others. So they keep building on each other. So the first is
tribalism, then colonialism, then capitalism. And each of them has sort of, you know, natural
intuitive logic as to why they exist, and also problems. And if we can figure out and solve
for their problems, we might might have a chance at a slightly more healthy and sustainable
civilization. So the first and most obvious is tribalism. And its externality, the thing it
doesn't include, right, is others. It's us versus them. So it's a sort of it's a social
externality. There's the us. And we are literally quite often, I mean, so many indigenous peoples
own name for themselves is just the people, you know, it's usually like in history books,
it becomes, you know, they get called where the whether it's the Sue or the Iroquois or
whomever it might be, it's typically their enemies call them that names or the ones that became
scouts or, you know, or collaborators with the Westerners get to name the people. But
the people is almost always the people, it's us. And we are right and good and true. And
everybody who's a part of our community is entitled to all the rights of our society and how we
operate. But if you live across the river, if you worship different gods, if you look funny,
talks funny, smell funny, right, you're them. And you are not the people and you are not like we
are not obliged to treat you the way we treat each other at all. And this is the barbarian,
this is the heretic, this is the apostate, right, this is the pagan, whatever it might be.
So we get to in the game of energy credits of like how do we move through this world and secure
enough resources to keep us alive and thriving, right, we don't have to extend that to you.
We are not you, we are not the other's keeper, we are just our brother's keeper.
So the externality is us versus them. Right. And it works. It's literally from a mother parent
into mother child bond to family bonds to clan, you know, to tribe to clan to band to tribe to
nation. That's how we do it. And tribalism these days has been politicized into nation nationalism,
right. So it's still that same through line, but it's ancient, ancient, ancient.
The next is colonialism. Right. And colonialism, you could basically just say is asymmetric trade
at the point of a sword. Right. So when you've got tribes us versus them, there's still kind of
thems that are closer to us than, than total wildcards, total barbarians. And there are neighbors,
right. Those are bloodlines, those are intermarriage, those are geographic proximity,
there's all those things and we trade with them. Right. And you've got some cool stuff and we might
specialize or we live closer to the coast and you guys live in the forest or whatever it might be.
And through extended trading networks that are mostly balanced and reciprocal,
we exchange goods and services and again, you know, marriages into intermarriage and
relationships and kinship ties. So that's trade. And that is an enormous layer of human cultural
extension and vitality and vibrancy. It raises the quality of life of everyone who participates in
it. Right. I mean, there are, there are, there are examples of carry shells in the great planes,
you know, that have made it thousands of miles through trade networks to there.
There's pemmican, which is a sort of basically a super duper trail mix with either
bear fat and grease or salmon and berries and things done in the Pacific Northwest that also
made it to the Lakota and other and the Comanche and other places you're like, oh my gosh,
so like the world has always been wildly interconnected, the Silk Route, all of that kind
of stuff. And, but then when it ceases to be reciprocal and it becomes asymmetrical
and enforced by force, that's when you get colonialism. And the externality there is
here, aka the country with the power or the tribe with the power versus there. We're going to chop
down your trees. We're going to hunt your beaver. We're going to enslave your people. We're going
to dig up your gold and silver and shiny things. And we're going to take them from there over to
here. Right. And it's that great line at the end of the godfather, which was Honoré de Balzax,
but he said, behind every great fortune lies a theft. And that's pretty much the bumper sticker
for colonialism. Right. And even to this day, where whether it's the Elgin marbles or various,
you know, the British Royal museums are stocked with loot from other countries. And these other
countries are now self aware enough and politically active enough and in case they're like, we'd like
our shit back, you know, and James Cameron, not James Cameron, sorry, David Cameron and other
British politicians have been like, yeah, well, I mean, if we gave it all back, we'd have nothing
in our museum. So we're not giving, we're not giving it back. And you're kind of like, oh,
my gosh, that is really as pronounced an example of here versus their externalities as you could
think of. And then the final one is capitalism. And this kind of gets us back to Darren Aronofsky
and the territory and sort of what is this giant all consuming machine. And capitalism,
its externality is now versus later. We will always take the profit now this month,
this quarter, this year, we will always over fish, over hunt, over log, over farm, over grays,
because to extract the profit now, more to the point to not extract the profit now,
is goes against everything we believe, including legally enforceable penalties,
right? Milton Friedman, the economist famously advanced first in a New York Times article,
and then in like 1971 or 72 of just like the sole purpose of a company should be just to
maximize shareholder profits. And that was just him thinking out loud. It was an op-ed
in the magazine on a Sunday. And it wasn't until like 1985 or 1986 where the Revlon shampoo company
was going to be hostile, he bought out and they and their board members tried to sue to prevent
it because they're like, we're going to be bought out by this cheap ass five and dime store that's
just going to gut us for parts and ruin our brain and we want to block the sale. And so mid-80s
was when it actually got enshrined in federal law. No, no, actually, Friedman was right,
sole responsibility of shareholders is to maximize profits. So that opened up the whole
Gordon Gekko greed is good 1980s, like with the hostile takeovers and leverage buyouts and all of
that. It also forced John Mackey to sell Whole Foods to Amazon because he was he was being strong on
by a venture capital fund that earned 8% earned 8% of Whole Foods and was going to basically gut him
for parts because all of the inefficiencies in their business like supporting organic farmers and
having healthy policies for their for their employees, all of that was just was not justified.
And that's how he ended up having to sell to Amazon. And it's also what prompted the Twitter
board to accept Elon Musk's wildly overpriced offer for Twitter, even though they were deeply
concerned as to what he was going to do about it, because they because basically they were
as members as members of the board, they were fiduciarily responsible and subject to being sued
if they hadn't accepted that wildly overpriced offer for Twitter, which if you were an old school
lover of Twitter, and you really cared for and cherished the wage act Dorsey and the others
had built the thing and what that community and cultural, you know, you might have been right
to see this as coming destruction, but they had to say yes, no matter what their personal feelings
were. So capitalism is always eating your seed corn, right? The idea of like typically, right,
farmers will always want to save corn to then plant for the next harvest. If you eat your
seed corn because you're too hungry in the winter and you didn't plan right, then you've got nothing
to plant the next year and then you're doubly triply out of luck. So if you take a look at
those three things, tribalism, the externality is them at the expense of us, or us, sorry, us at
the expense of them. Colonialism is there, or Jesus Christ, colonialism is here at the expense of
there and capitalism is now at the expense of later. So a tidy integration of those things
is to say how would we fix the math so that our civilizational calculus actually spits out
healthy, sustainable, equitable answers is to say instead of us versus them, right, it's everyone.
Instead of here versus there, it's everywhere. And instead of now versus later, it's everyone.
So if we built our civilizational calculus, instead of having all these externalities,
right, that other people and other places and other times have to get stuck with the bill,
right, get bankrupted, if we could all settle on everyone everywhere, everyone
is how we choose to make decisions going forward. We would have a shot at making the most of the
tools, the very deep structural cultural tools we have of tribalism, trade, right, and commerce
and innovation, and bundle them together in ways that don't keep spitting out pathological or
dysfunctional answers. That was beautifully presented. And once again, I'm going to have to
review what you just said and think on it over and over again. You have an amazing way of just
putting these very complex ideas together. And I'm scribbling down notes so fast that my papers
catching on fire here. But I'm wondering, can these three levels, the colonization,
the capitalism and the tribalism, could that be solved on an individual level?
Or is this something that a third party system needs to come in and fix?
Well, I mean, gosh, that is such a massive question. I mean, I think the simplest is
there's so much inertia behind all of these things that individual change is sort of
necessary but not sufficient. And that is, and again, in the same way that that environmental
cosnets curve, the idea of like, oh, the way forward is faster because, you know, advanced
societies pollute less, but we really kind of want to just hear that. So we don't scrutinize it too
much as to how it's consistently true is that notion. The idea that change comes from within,
and if I want to heal the world, I have to work first to heal myself, becomes an incredible bit
of motivated reasoning to just shove my head all the way up my ass in a bunch of narcissistic
personal growth and self-help, which is without a doubt just a part of neoliberal capture of
fragmented isolated consumer individuals scratching all the itches that get agitated
via the constant barrage of marketing messages of quick fixes and easy hits and utopian outcomes.
So in that level, it is sort of, again, yes, of course, if you come from hate, you will so hate,
you know, you plant ice, you're going to harvest wind, right? So there is some element of interior
change. And if you look at the largest, most, you know, high impact change agents, at least in the
last, you know, few decades from Nelson Mandela to Gandhi to King to kind of the usual suspects,
they all were coming from a fundamentally different frequency than the tribal people they led.
And Malcolm X as well, right? And Fred Hampton, there's a number of instances where
that those leaders were clearly vibrating, you know, on a different frequency than the center
of gravity of the people they inspired and fundamentally led. So a huge, you know, hat tip
and acknowledgement to the power of transformational consciousness and its ability to set a tone
that otherwise a bunch of disorganized, fractious primates would never get to in a million years.
I often think of it like we used to live in Santa Barbara and there was this
historic Sunday sunset drum circle on the beach. And our music teacher, who was this brilliant
Sarod and Satara player, he and his crew of Tabla and Gembe and Conga players would often be there
and they would be the core of the drum circle. And you'd go on those nights and that drum circle
was Tehr the Rufa, funky, right? With hundreds of people, like huge energy pulsing and the thing
was amazing. And then they would be on tour and you go down there on that weekend and there was
nobody who was deeply, deeply talented gifted in the center of that drum circle. And it would be
a noodley, mushy hippie shit show. And so you do kind of think like, Oh, who's the metronome? Who's
the timekeeper? Because it's far easier. Like it takes a field to hold a field. It takes somebody's
coherent energy to then bring everybody into that. It's far easier to follow a good beat
than it is to hold one yourself if you're not trained. The flip side is that in order for us to
sort of quote unquote, fix at a societal level or at a global level, the other element. So tribalism
is just, you know, basically after oxytocin, you know, which bonds mother to child and, and, you
know, tribe to tribe, everything and everything is optional. So all of our humanist elements,
all of our efforts to say, Hey, that person on the other side of the world that I don't know,
that doesn't worship the same cause, that doesn't speak the same language or eat the same foods,
and I'll never meet again is entitled to something intrinsically human as am I. Like that is an
incredibly fragile experiment. And it is not encoded into our DNA into our biology into our
neurochemistry or even into any level of our survival and printing. Like I mean mine. Now
and next is our survival and printing. So everyone everywhere, everyone is Bodhisattva level
awareness and it's fragile. But as far as like helping like colonialism, you know, the idea of
extraction of the point of a sword, that can for sure be, you know, quote unquote fixed in the
simple sense of acknowledging the originator of natural resources, goods and services and cutting
them into the economic deal. I mean, the fact that in Nigeria, they are a net exporter of fossil
fuels that then get refined piped to Europe, refined and then sold back to them at a profit.
You're like, that's, that's horribly, horribly wrong. And Sierra Leone, there was a very cool
TED talk by a woman from Sierra Leone being like, we're often, you know, labeled as one of the poorest
countries in Africa, etc. We're not. And she talked about, you know, their mining assets,
the diamonds, like all of these things, like here's our natural resources. We're actually
massively gifted in those terms. We've just been totally exploited. So fixing colonialism simply
by not allowing rapacious multinational companies in cahoots with the IMF and World Bank and debt
leveraged, you know, extortion, setting up terms and conditions that just siphon off natural resources.
Let's just start with that. Never mind what would one do with 500 years of reparations,
like that's probably politically, economically feasible, you know, not feasible to sort in any
meaningful way. But doing right by folks right now could be. And let's start with that. And then
with capitalism, and Daniel Schmackenberger, Daniel Schmackenberger and I have actually
had this conversation because so many of his critiques lead to, oh, this is a self terminating
system. Therefore, you have to get politicians to stop doing it. I'm like, well, what politician in
their right mind could say anything that you've just said and not instantly be branded as a Marxist
and instantly lose their term in office and therefore all their access to influence, you know,
so it would just be it would be career suicide and then they wouldn't be on team. Good guy being
able to affect any change. So we have to have something that splits the difference. And my
personal feeling is that saying, you know, like the rallying cry of free the market,
free the market. Capitalism is a great idea. It's just never been tried, right? It's always been
monopolies, rent seeking, crony capitalism, subsidies, you know, like, like whether it's
lobbyists or whatever it is, like, like it's never, we've never actually had that, you know,
classroom ideal of an economic, a free, low frictionless exchange of good services with
dynamic pricing, reflecting needs and values and all the things that you hear about in econ
class have never actually been tried. So let's do that. Let's free the market. And that's kind of
your judo move of getting both conservatives and progressives on the same team, because you're not
trying to break the entire system, you're just saying, let's actually do the thing we said we
were going to. Let's start with let's let's not even worry about universal basic income. Let's just
have everybody pay their fair share. So whatever the tax code is right now, it could be wildly
asymmetrical, it could be regressive, it could be a bunch of things. But right now, there's so
many loopholes and so many exceptions for the wealthiest folks. Let's just have everybody pay
their fair share. Let's just start with that. Let's abolish the 14th amendment, right? Because the
14th amendment, which most people remember from high school is like, oh, that's the one that freed
the slaves, isn't it? That's a good one. You're like, yeah, but weirdly, bizarrely, 20 years later,
Leland Stanford, who founded Stanford University, and his his railroad, his lawyers trying to wiggle
out of some taxes completely made up a complete fabrication that the 14th amendment really meant
guaranteeing the rights of personhood to corporations as well. It's the craziest story you've ever heard
because the Supreme Court has seen has judged like 280 cases or something since then defending the
right of corporations as persons, and only like 30 on actually the rights of black folks as citizens.
So it hijacked the entire thing and has given us all of 20th and 21st century law on how much
political power corporations have, right? So you've got to abolish that and the Friedman doctrine
that the sole and exclusive responsibility of corporations is to extract maximum shareholder
profit. If you don't do those things, you're dead in the water, right? Because the ratchets all go
towards a governance system, a capitalization table, legally enforceable incentives,
and court of law. I mean, there's situations now where because of that notion of corporations as
persons, there are in international courts, nations are being sued by multinational corporations for
daring to enact environmental policies that protect their streams, their rivers, their watersheds,
their topsoil, and their people at the expense of maximum optimized profitability for the
multinational corporation and the multinationals are winning. So you have situations like that and
you're like, okay, that's a stitch up. That's not actually, it doesn't matter how many do-gooders
don't, it doesn't matter how many, you know, Twitter campaigns or Instagrams, you know, social,
you know, click, click and click and like, and follow the activists. None of that can work
if the rule of law is so hijacked and compromised by these perverse incentives that are now legally
enshrined. So back to your original question, can this be done on an individual level versus
on a collective level? For sure, you know, we have to come from, you know, love, light,
consciousness, inclusion, hopefully some joy, hopefully some play, right, some sense of this
is worth doing together, right? And there are absolutely technical legal structural conditions
that until those are dislodged, right, they will, they will block and undermine even the best of
intentions. That's a brilliant point. And I guess I lean more towards the individual side, because
I've lately, I've lost so much faith in our institutions and our governments. And I've seen
the power of what an individual change can have on the world, you know, you change yourself,
you change the world. And so like, to the tribalism to the capitalism colonialism on each of those
levels, like, if the individual says, Hey, I'm not, we're not going to support any products that
have this chemical in it, we're done. The market is going to have to adjust, right? I mean, look
how many people want organic food now, and are rejecting the pesticides. There's a huge demand
for products that don't have plastic anymore, because people are now aware of how harmful
phthalates are to our endocrine systems. You know, it's, it's because people are getting more aware
that it's putting this demand on the companies and the market has to adjust to that, that individual
epiphany. And so you can apply that to colonialism and tribalism, like if you realize that we're all
one, and that anything that I do to hurt another person will hurt me in the end, and that by destroying
the forest, I'm really just destroying myself. Those deep understandings can kind of make tribalism
and colonialism deteriorate, I think. Maybe that's just like a, you know, that's a very utopian vision.
But I do feel like I've seen people who have become, I guess, enlightened, not to sound cliché.
And I've seen how much they step away from things that are harming the world and how much good they
can do, just one person, and how that spreads throughout a community.
Yeah, absolutely. And to me, that almost lives in a, that lives in another and distinct and very,
very important category, which is, and it's what I literally, it was the central thesis of the last
book I wrote, Recapture the Rapture, which was, hey, look, all of our technical tactical solutions
probably aren't going to pencil out, right? We're trying, we're bargaining, we're hoping,
we're innovating, we're delaying, we're stalling, we're, you know, like all of it, like it's just,
it's a shit show, and the math doesn't work. But, right, there is this thing that happens
once in a blue moon, and we talked about King Mandela Gandhi, but there's a lot of others,
right, where singular, isolated acts of human love, creativity, and courage. I mean, Banksy is
another example, like Banksy is just wildly on point, almost all the time, and he's an anonymous
artist that just does street art, but he's always like, hey, he's kind of like this cosmic prankster,
trickster, and he makes millions of humans think differently, right? Think about Tankman in Tiananmen
Square, right, where he just stood in front of the tanks, he had shopping bags, he was tired,
he just kind of come home from work, he didn't plan it, right? He's just like, fuck this, right?
And then he was whisked off, spirited away, like no one knows what happened to him afterwards,
and yet we all know who we're talking about, Tankman in Tiananmen Square, right? The cellist of
Sarajevo, in the midst of the Yugoslavian Civil War, with all sorts of atrocities, in the bombed-out
rubble of Sarajevo, he just sat down on a chair and just played every night at sunset, and the
snipers on both sides didn't kill him. Everybody was yearning for that glimpse of humanity, of beauty,
in the midst of all of that horror, right? And he changed the tide of things, however slightly.
You know, the example I always go back to is, you know, the band, you know, the band played on,
on the Titanic, right? A string quartet who didn't scrap for those remaining seats in
the lifeboats. He let the women and children go first, realize their goose was thoroughly cooked,
and didn't just succumb to being panicky-scared people. They said, what is our Dharma? What
are we here to do? What are we given our lives to, and why would we hear on this ship in the
first place? It was because we are the musicians. And so, you know, Buddhism 101, Sikh refuge in
the Dharma, they sought refuge in it, and the tune they played was, nearer my God to thee,
right? So at a time where they could have succumbed to self-interest, where they could have been
kicking and screaming, they could have been just in survival instincts. They instead elevated up.
And we might not remember their names, but we remember what they did,
and we tell those stories. You know, the more kind of agromatria one would be, you know,
King Leonidas and the Spartans at Thermopylae, right? Against the Persian hordes. You know,
and today, today we fight in the shade, right? Because there's that many arrows coming our way,
like those acts of courage and heroism. Gandhi called it Satyagraha, which means truth force.
When it made its way back to the United States via Howard Thurman to Martin Luther King, it became
soul force. And MLK even mentions that in his I Have a Dream speech. He says, well, we can meet,
when we can meet physical force through the majestic heights of soul force,
right? Then we have a chance to turn things on a dime. And so that thought being is like, well,
what if what if we could scale soul force? What if there are ways to have more human, some tiny,
critical mass of people on Erica Chenoweth at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has
famously pegged that at three and a half percent of a population, whether that's still true or
deeply true, or you know, will be will be true playing forward. Don't know. But let's just say
we're not there yet. So let's get there and see how it looks from there. Right? What is the possibility
of three and a half percent of humans accessing their own truth force, their own soul force,
and then making just sending out that EMP of humanity, of courage, of truth,
and just bearing witness to it. And then like, and then let the chips fall, right? It's not that
those guys were fiddling on the Titanic in the hopes that that the Coast Guard was going to hear
them and pick them up. Right? They're like soul force is is my life is forfeit. None of us get
out of here alive. I already I know this and accept it. Now what? Right? Now what? And that is where
the beginning of something profound could happen. I mean, you know, and on a very tactical example,
like a counterfactual, because you're like, Oh, three and a half percent of people being super
groovy. Is that really going to change things? You're like, Well, actually, look at what happens
when a tiny percentage of people are super shitty. So our friend Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin at the
Center for Humane Tech, they did the social dilemma that big documentary on social media ills
found research that was basically saying that 90% of all social media of all generated social media
that all of us read is created by 5% of the people on the furthest extremes. So 90% of social media
is created by 10% of the humans, you know, half and half on either side of the political spectrum.
And a subsequent study down in Australia found that those folks that are on the far extremes
score off the charts for dark triad personality types and authoritarianism. So narcissism,
sociopathy, Machiavellianism and authoritarianism are the 10% of the humans generating 90% of what
we all read and view, which is absolutely insane because how many people scroll through their
social media are like, I hate humans. We're screwed. You know, I don't want to be a part of this
civilization or this society. It's a totally logical conclusion. It's just that it's not
the 90% of the humans in the middle. 90% of the humans in the middle want a chance to live
a better life than their parents had and give a better life to their kids and die in their sleep
surrounded by their grandchildren. Like that has always been what most of us want.
And so breaking through those false barriers, those algorithmically optimized notions of
separation and frustration and getting back to mutuality and connection where we see each
other's humanity and we recognize that there's something worth defending and protecting here
does feel super important. So to your question, like surely, hey, is there something about the
individual? It absolutely has to be done at this level. And there is something asymmetrically
different than I'm just going to yoga and using my breathwork app and my headspace and my ice baths.
And this is all about me as a co-opted neoliberal capitalist consumer of late stage capitalism,
right? Like that version doesn't go anywhere. That is a that is a insidious stall and diversion
tactic of the people with the greatest privilege from their social civic political responsibilities,
but stepping into the deeper prospect of what happens if a bunch of us, some critical mass of
us actually access our soul force and take a stand and say enough is enough. I am here to bear
witness to the least of my brothers and sisters, you know, on behalf of goodness, truth and beauty
for as long as it takes. That feels like a game with playing.
Absolutely. And I love how this conversation just flowed naturally. We we haven't even gotten
to my first question that I wrote down. But but I love how it this has just been an organic flow.
The questions have just come naturally. But I think this leads into the first question that I
wrote down. I've seen an incredible rise in cynicism. And I spend a lot of my time reading
comments online. And it seems like that must suck. You know, I know it's a bad habit, but
a lot of the comments I get on my channel are very genuine. You know, they're not not trolls.
So I take most of them seriously into consideration. And, you know, I like I get a lot of positive
comments on my channels. I think it's rare, because a lot of the comments, a lot of the feedback is
positive. But I've just just scrolling online, I see so much cynicism. And just even in the titles
of videos, everything's kind of like, let's take something that most people think is good. And
let's talk about how it's actually terrible. And I feel like there's so many takes like,
if you want to make a viral video that gets a lot of attention, you just pick something that a lot
of people think to be true. And then you say how it's false. You know, if I made a video right now
that said AI is actually past its prime, it's peaked. Most people think that AI is
advancing super fast. But if I make a take that's the opposite to what most people think,
even if it's completely unfounded, that take is going to get a lot of attention. And I think a
lot of content creators have kind of figured out that hack. And so they're just, the internet is
flooded with these contrarian takes, you know what I'm saying? And I think it's led to people
not knowing what's true anymore. And the natural response is just cynicism. And cynicism has gotten
confused with intelligence. Like, even in movies, if you see somebody who's like,
happy, go lucky, we think, Oh, that person must be ignorant. And the person that's always like,
very skeptical, is seen as the intelligent one. So like this cynicism has been connected with
intelligence and people, their natural response now is just to, Okay, let me just not trust anything.
Let me just think that everything's bad. Have you also noticed this rise in cynicism?
Yeah, so I mean, the symbology is, is for sure. It does feel like there is a spike in,
you know, nothing is true. Nothing is trustworthy. Even the thing, even our sacred cows, that we used
to sort of think we're up and above that, like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson and George
Washington will actually turned out they were slaveholders or misogynists or something, you
know, something along those lines, like, is there any one, is there any thing? And again, even back
to, you know, enlightenment values, or the American experiment, you know, or whatever it might be.
There's somebody taking a sledgehammer or a chisel to all of our, you know, monuments, to all
of the edifices to the things that we have, we used to potentially, you know, accept more at face
value. And we had spoken a little bit earlier about how things are getting exponentially better
and exponentially worse at the same time. And that's overwhelming. So at the same time that just,
you know, everything from the complexities and the consequences of our current moment,
which are just sort of objective, plus the massively accelerated amount of information
we all have access to through our super smart smartphones, you know, constantly
bombarding us at all times. I mean, I read something that basically, a Sunday edition
of the New York Times, just as thick as that is, was as much information as a monk in the
Middle Ages consumed in his lifetime. And we're getting that before breakfast every day.
You know, it's absurd and bananas, right? So at the same time that we have this huge spike in
both volume and consequence of the information we're consuming, we've had a loss in our familiar
landmarks. And you can kind of say, you know, sort of meaning 1.0 was that notion of organized
religion. And that was your sacred scriptures and your priests and your community rabbis,
you know, imams in your community, they told you what was what they told you where you lived
in the world and your universe and how to be and what to do, etc, etc. And if there was something
weird, like a comet or a meteor or, you know, or a strange happening, you went to them and they
told you what to think about it. So that was our overwhelming and dominant source of information
until the last 3 400 years of increasingly the advent of modern liberalism, not meaning
Democrat, but just meaning that the Enlightenment experiment, the combinations of science, of
empiricism, of rule of law, of civil liberties and all of those kinds of things. And those are the
institutions like everything from the CDC and the WHO, right, to the World Bank to the United
Nations to, you know, Yale and Harvard and MIT and all of our institutions to McKinsey and Goldman
Sachs, right, like all of those kind of icons. And, you know, for the first time ever, we've had
the collapse in both of those pillars at the same time that we're having this exponential
complexity. So we're more in need of trusted and trustworthy voices to tell us which end
is up at the same time that they've both collapsed. So the roof is kind of caved in
on our separation of church and state, kind of modern liberal secular societies. And into that
vacuum, you're getting people pulled to fundamentalism on one side, which is like it's too big,
it's too scary out there, just give me something, anything to sink my teeth into, believe, rock
to cling to, just tell me what that might be. And on the other side, nihilism, like I give up,
this is hopeless, there is no there, there, we are just in a cyclic creation and destruction,
there is no higher purpose or power, there is no times arrow direction to where we're going,
this is just more of the same shit. So you're naming of the cynicism, you can make a case,
either you put that in that in the nihilism bucket, it's just a flavor of that, right,
or you could say that's somehow hanging out in the middle, you know, where you are sort of perversely
incented to kick down anything anyone believes, right, because you have no faith that there's
something more to be had. And cynicism and hedonism, I think often pair together, right,
if there's nothing, if there's no other better game to play, and I can go around kicking down
everybody's sand castles, then the only thing left to do is for me to get mine, right, seek
pleasure, avoid pain, you know, and that might even be clicks and likes and trolling, that might be
pleasurable to me. So, you know, and so that's not just sort of an abstract theoretical model,
right, is it predictive? Does it help its mind? You're like, oh, look what's happening with
fundamentalism, like not only are we seeing a resurgence in that in organized religions,
but you're seeing some weird ass hybrids, you're seeing, you know, there was just a piece
this about three months ago on the rise of orthobros, right, which was Eastern Orthodox
Christian, you know, sort of Joe Rogan, podcaster, guns and steroid MMA guys, getting into Eastern
Orthodoxy in Houston, so a huge, and they've even taken over the Eastern Orthodox communities,
in Houston, Texas, and a colleague of ours, Isabella, Tara Isabella Burton,
who wrote a great book called Strange Rights, which is kind of everything from
Burning Man and Soul Cycle to all these weird expressions of religiosity in the contemporary
world, she's written in the New York Times, about the, the, basically the return to extreme
orthodoxies in Catholic, like folks like young people, millennials, are going in New York City,
are getting pulled into like Latin masses, they're like the older and the, and the sort of more
code based, and the more tell me what to do, the more I'm going to get off on it, it's almost like
a sort of existential kink, it's a little bit like being a submissive in BDSM, it's like I've
just spent a decade, all about me, clicking on insert posts, going to yoga retreats in Bali,
doing medicine ceremonies, like learning my attachment styles, you know, da da da, healing
my ancestral trauma, and it is fucking exhausting, and I don't feel any better off at all, and all I
want is somebody to tell me what to think and what to believe. So you have even that from like the
progressive kind of new age self-help left, you have a return to people who are just, you know,
and Russell Brand converted to Christianity, we have several other mutual friends that have just
recently come out and sort of stated their claim of returning to Christianity, Jordan Peterson
has been a voice of, right, kind of traditionalist, classical values and meaning.
Hirsam, what's her name? Hirsam Ali, I think she might have a first name, but it's Nile Ferguson's
wife and partner, she very publicly recently left Islam altogether as her family of origin, faith,
and converted to Christianity. So you're seeing, you know, and then throw in wing nut conspiracy
theories like QAnon. So those are all expressions of heightened fundamentalism, you're like,
yep, okay, that was the model, seemed like if we don't have solid pillars to hold up our consensus
reality together, we're all fragmenting and fracturing. And then the nihilism side, you're
seeing that, you know, I think 50, maybe it was, I think it was 54% of Gen Z's surveyed in the United
States by Pew Research Foundation concluded that they would find a military dictatorship preferable
to representative democracy. And you're like, whoa, okay, that's not something that's been
around for a long time. The recent European parliamentary elections have shown a significant
rightward shift. And we're getting into the kind of burn it all down territory where people are
not, you know, you used to think that like two parties didn't really matter which side you
were on, everybody would agree to play by the rules of this great nation we were founded on or
whatever, you know, or European cultures and governance traditions. And now you're having many,
many more people in the hashtag burn it all down category. This is marabund. This is corrupt.
This never should have happened in the first place, or it was a good idea, but it's fatally
tainted now. And the best thing to do is just bulldoze the whole thing. This is not a fixer
wrapper. Right. This is buy it for the lot and scrape this thing and start again,
seasteading crypto currencies, all those guys have breakaway civilization ideas. And then
how's it just happening for most people, for most people that are pulled into the nihilism.
It's just personally and psychologically and emotionally overwhelming. So those folks aren't
on Twitter and they're not hatching, you know, they're not hatching plans for breakaway societies or,
you know, or following Steve Bannon to some fascist retreat in the Italian Alps. Right.
Those people are just succumbing to diseases of despair, addiction, depressions, anxiety, suicide.
And so that is what we're seeing at this point. And so the question is, is into that vacuum,
we would expect to see all sorts of cultic communities arise. Right. Give me a charismatic
demagogic leader, give me someone who's pulling the juice, right, who has a certainty that is
persuasive or compelling. And that can promise me that all that I'm seeing and experiencing right
now isn't isn't wrong or bad or my fault. There's someone or something to blame. There's always
something or someone to blame because that's the tribalism DNA. Right. And we can get to a
happily ever after if you only follow me, join us, do the thing, which is a rapturous ideology,
like the world you're right, the world is screwed up, it's fucked up, it's irredeemable.
And we're coming to an inflection point really soon where everything changes. Right. That could be
the revolution, that could be the rapture, it could be whatever it is, some it could be artificial
general intelligence at some point soon, we can see it from here if we squint, it's coming. So get
ready and follow me because here's the deal. On the other side of that inflection point, us, our
tribe, we come up roses, we're actually better off on the other side. So let's get there as fast as
possible. Right. And hop on board. And those rapture ideologies, they show up in fundamentalist
religion, but they also show up in techno utopianism, they show up in Silicon Valley with Ray Coswell
and Peter Diamandis and right and Mark Andreessen. Right. They show up in the storm is coming in
QAnon stuff. Right. You see them everywhere. They show up in crypto, hodl, you know, like and then
there's going to be some collapse in fiat currency and then everybody holding fat Bitcoin and ETH
wallets will come up roses and we'll have a debt jubilee and we'll reboot the entire global
financial systems. Right. Everybody's peddling some version of that. And they sell hope because
they all promise to leapfrog the train wreck that's in front of us. And the train wreck is much
harder to sort out. So it's like, well, we're not even gonna sort it out. And in fact, our buddy
Doug Rushkoff, who wrote Team Human and doomsday prep for the super rich, even called it the mindset
in Silicon Valley in particular, because he was he was brought by like five hedge fund guys,
flown out to some super secret desert compound and given tens of thousands of dollars to give a
talk. And he thought he was giving a real talk. And then he realized, oh, these guys, there's no
one to talk to. It's not like they're a whole stable of traders that he was here to talk to. It
was just them. And they wanted to grill him on the apocalypse. And he identified, which I thought
was a brilliant move, the mindset. And he called it with a capital M, the mindset. And the mindset
is fundamentally, you know, not unique to Silicon Valley, but ubiquitous in Silicon Valley of, hey,
never mind all these messy human problems, never mind our cultural history, never mind our government,
never mind rules and regulations, never mind any of that. We'll, we'll, we just want a blank piece
of paper to rebuild our utopian vision on. So we're not going to engage in humanity. This is a
bunch of sort of Asperger guys, you know, fundamentally, like, under socialized, not
especially well-mammaled, rarely in the company or the accountability of a good strong woman,
imagining these fictive scenarios where it's up and out. And whether that's Mars or whether that's
some, you know, real estate we bought in, you know, inland, inland from the Bay Area, we're
rebooting there or, you know, or it's, you know, offshore or, or it's wherever. And, and that tends
to be a situation that almost always is a one percenter solution. However you slice the one
percent, it could be that worth, but it could be the morally elect or saved, it could be the
intelligent and the brilliant, it could be the holders of my certain crypto coin, it could be
whomever, but it's a one percenter play that leaves 99% of humanity and all the four-leggeds,
you know, and the winged and the finned and everybody, you know, all the other creatures on
this earth with the short end of that straw. So that's what brings us back to what are solutions,
what's a civilizational calculus that works for everyone, everywhere, everyone. All of us are
none of us, just as an ethical pledge. And this planet, you know, no fucking off to space, if we
can't, if we, if we've trashed Eden and we're trying to reconstruct habitable environments out
of completely contrived situations, like not going to happen, these bodies, right, the idea of not
becoming cyborgs, actually honoring these beautiful organisms that we've been gifted with being
self-aware within, and this lifetime, you know, not punting to life, indefinite life extension
for a fortunate few, but to say we fully embrace this human lifespan, we fully embrace this earth,
we fully embrace our bodies to take a stand for all of us, right, on behalf of the good,
the true, and the beautiful. I mean, none of this is new, right? This is, if you think about
what we see on Instagram and TikTok these days, where we are constantly shouted at and whispered at
and promised and seduced to believe that you can have it all now in just three easy steps,
right, like scan the world's wisdom traditions, scan every saint, sage, and philosopher that has
ever lived and left a mark in our collective consciousness, and not a single one of them
has said anything remotely that juvenile, self-obsessed, or perverse. You know, what have they said?
They've said, hey, life's a mixed bag, right? I mean, I defer to, there was that old,
old Yeller was a famous Disney movie about a kid who adopts a dog. We actually listened to it as we
were moving our family to Austin. I'm like, oh, great, I remember old Yeller. We'll do a book on
tape. That'll be the road trip. And as it turns out, of course, with old dog movies and all horse
movies, the dog doesn't make it. He gets, he defends them and he gets bitten by a wolf or a coyote.
He gets rabies. They have to put him down, right? So the sun is broken up, as were our kids in the
backseat. They're like, dad, we're never, ever listening to another book on tape about a dog
again. And the dad's sitting on the rocking chair on their, on their ranch house. And he's like,
son, the way I, the best, the way I figure it, you know, about half a life is good parts,
and half a life is bad parts. But if you spend all the good parts worrying about all the bad
parts, why, then it's all bad. You know, and that's, that's St. Francis, Augustine, Buddha,
Lao Tzu, right? You know, like they, they all acknowledge life's a bitch and then we die.
And then there was an event inevitably the, so what do we do about that in the in between?
And my sense right now, and maybe we can, maybe we can even wrap with this, right,
is how to find hope. What, what is the antidote to cynicism, right? The antidote to cynicism is
a point on a purpose. And Joanna Macy, who's a Zen grandmother and, you know, one of the most
profound ecologists and activists of her generation, she's described our time in history,
right, as being the people of the passage. Like it is on us to get from here to there.
And if you think about the, you know, the settlement of the Western Hemisphere, like
arguably through the land bridge, right, between Asia and Alaska, Beringia, right?
We are all Beringians now, but in time, not space, right? So where like 15,000
Asian nomads shimmied across that in little boats and, you know, on foot and in the ice ages and
various bits and pieces to make it and populate this entire half the world. We're doing that in
time. Like there's a constraint coming, there's a constraint coming, which is how do we transition
off this hyperconsumptive, right, techno industrial, cob and indulgent civilization,
this complex dissipative structure, right, that's creating entropy like nobody's business.
How do we navigate that with a bloated population of 8 billion people,
half of which would not exist? I mean, a half of which happened in my lifetime, right? We went
from 4 billion to 8 billion since the 70s. And at the same time, half of the people alive, every
single one of those new extra people only is here because we're using fossil fuels as fertilizers
and pesticides. So how do we do this? This is a complex dissipated structure, this energy
hungry civilization that if we stop the energy inputs collapses. If it collapses, that's
curtains for so many of us and so much tragedy and suffering. So how do we leapfrog, right,
from this situation to a lower carbon, higher energy, higher efficiency civilization that
protects and preserves us. So that's Joanna Macy's question. We're the people of the passage,
right? What is ours to do? How do we maintain hope, right? How do we die before we die,
right? So that we know our lives are forfeit. I'm no longer just a self-interested little monkey
seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. I'd realize my life is my offering, my life is my gift.
So that's step one. Step two, let's go from living as a fragmented, isolated little potted plant
of a deconditioned zoo animal hyper neurotic consumer individual to taking my stand in a stand
of community and relations. How do I live seven generationally? How do I live on behalf of my
great great grandparents who clearly busted us to get me this little ember that I've now fanned
into a flame? Do I get to say I'm sad or mad or disappointed they didn't give me more? No,
they fucking gave me the ember and I'm now basking in a bonfire like amen. And my three
generations ahead of me, my children, my children's children, my children's children's children,
how do I live as part of that seven generations? And then to your point about what does life have
a purpose does it have a point? It's both, right? Life is both cyclical and endlessly
creating and destroying. And that is senseless and amoral and horrifying to contemplate from our
point of view where we care deeply about our little part of things. And it's also a creative
every single time that cycle of creation and destruction happens, it spits out complexity.
It spits out these novel rare precious moments and we can we can anchor to them by ritual,
seeking refuge and ritual, marking the seasons, marking our lives, marking our rites of passage,
right? Noticing one of the most profound ones I've seen was just a black and white photo
of a Jewish family in Amsterdam in 1941 celebrating Hanukkah. And you're like, oh man,
like that was darkness. That was peak peak darkness of World War Two. And there they were
oppressed and hunted. And they were still bearing witness to their lineage's rituals. Think of the
Tibetan diaspora. Think of any First Nation peoples that have been relocated. Think of the Rohingya,
the Uyghurs, right, the Kurds, you know, the Roma, like there are fourth world peoples,
peoples without a homeland, right, that have been able to persist by carrying their rituals.
So this is what it means to be the people of the passage. And if we can do those three things,
right, if we can die before we die, so we know what's ours to give, we can live seven generationally.
So that stretches out our sense of what if I don't get mine? No. Oh, it's okay. Because I'm doing
something on behalf of those yet to be. And we seek refuge and ritual. We anchor the insanity
and the constant slipstream towards entropy with, right, observing the passages. And then finally,
what does that allow us to do? It allows us to leave space for grace. Because none of us know
how this is going to turn out. And that's Thanos's pathology, right? Thanos is right up to the point
where he is 100% certain of how it's all going to turn out. And therefore that justifies his
murderous behavior. We can never be sure. There's a great quote I heard recently, which is we, we,
we control nothing. We influence everything. And we have no idea, right, where those ripples
will go. So by leaving space for grace, like, do we know how this all turns out? No. None of us
could possibly know how it all turns out. But one thing is certain. If we give up hope now,
then hope has no chance. If we hold on to radical hope, which is a very, it's actually, it's not
just an adjective or a superlative, it's an academic term from Jonathan Lear at the University
of Chicago, who studied 19th century Indian reservations and radical hope is a specific
definition. It's having hope for a future you cannot see from here, but commit to nonetheless.
So leaving space for grace, right, is the butterfly effect. Time soul force at the end of time for
all the models. That's brilliant. And I'd like to read a quote to you from my favorite movie,
Lord of the Rings, that I think it just kept coming up in this conversation. And especially
now we're at the end of two towers. You've seen Lord of the Rings, right? Oh, yeah, dude. I did
my senior thesis in high school on Lord of the Rings. I've been way in the pudding. We ran a
camp called Rivendell long before the movies came out. Oh, my God, that sounds amazing. So at the
end of two towers, when all hope seemed to be lost, Sam says to Frodo, it's all wrong by rights. We
shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo, the ones that really
mattered, full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't even want to know the end,
because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was before so much
bad happened? But in the end, it is only a passing thing, this shadow, even darkness must pass. A
new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clear. Those were the stories
that stayed with you, that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think,
Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't, because they were holding on to something. And then Frodo says,
what were they holding on to, Sam? And he says, that there's something good in this world,
Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for. And so like, when you told me about the family,
celebrating Hanukkah in 1941, in the midst of World War II, they're being hunted,
you know, it's like, in the darkest night, they held on to that little flame, and that got them
through the deep dark, you know, you got it, you got to hold on to something, you got to find some
little shred of good in this world, and hold on to it, and that'll get you through anything. And
you know, it's like the night is the coldest just before dawn, which if you spend any time in the
mountains is you know, like you're literally waiting for the sun to come up to get some sleep.
Yeah. Yeah. So no matter how bad things seem, it'll pass. And you just got to hold on to what is good.
Well, you know, to riff on the Tolkien stuff, that notion of leaving space for grace, because
like we don't know how it's going to turn out, isn't simply the kind of Hollywood version of a
story of like, oh, it's climactic, and we don't know. And then finally, Rocky comes back with
the final punch and wins the belt, you know, like that kind of thing. Because if you think about,
I mean, I think it's so brilliant how Tolkien did this, right, because how does against all
overwhelming odds of Mordor and darkness, how does light prevail? Right? Light prevails in Lord of
the Rings through the perverse actions of Golan. And, and somewhere earlier, I think Sam, you know,
Sam hates Golan, right? And he's in that constant back and forth with Frodo. And Sam wants to kill
him. And Gandalf intervenes. And he says he may yet have a part to play. Oh, Frodo wants to
kill him. Oh, does he? Okay. Yeah. And the first one Frodo wants to kill him, and Gandalf says that.
Yes. Okay. Thank you. So yes, the hobbits want to kill Golan, who's Smeagol, who is arguably,
I mean, you know, I think there's a new film now coming out, it's going to unpack a bunch of this,
but like, right, I mean, he was a hobbit like device before he gets completely warped by the
ring. So it's in some respect, it's the hobbit's shadow self, right? And they want to kill him.
Gandalf says, hey, wait, he may still. So the, the, the simplistic version of that
would be, oh, we show him love and compassion. And then Smeagol triumphs over Golan, right?
And we now integrate him into the light and he's on team good guy and he does something good for
us. No, that's not what happens, right? In the crux, not even Frodo stays true to his higher
nature. The ring bends everyone. Smeagol collapses entirely into his Golan self and they are struggling
shadow to shadow and that somehow with the biting off of Frodo's finger, right? And Golan falling
into Mount Doom, that's what saves it. And that kind of impossible ambiguity, right? Still delivering
redemption to me is one of the best lessons for us because it's not a happily ever after
simplistic heroic arc. It's not where good is rewarded with good and bad and evil is punished.
It's an, it's a wildly ironic ending, right? But the leaving space for grace, which is what Gandalf
was taking a stand for back before he possibly had any idea what that might mean, right? It's the
commitment to that that then saves Middle Earth. And that I think is one of the most
powerful lessons for all of us because again, from time to time, we're going to be facing,
and not even from time to time, probably increasingly, we will be facing a litany of
news that simply doesn't pencil out. And the kind of whistling past the graveyard hope, you know,
is simply going to be inadequate. So we have to be able to anchor to something deeper and more
enduring. And, and I think Gandalf's lesson is a, is a beautiful one for all of us.
Absolutely. Well, on that note, I think this podcast has gone amazing right from the beginning.
You were just on fire. I like the podcast, right? I don't have to talk much.
Oh, no way. For me, if I talk like less than 1%, that's great. But this was amazing. And
I'm sure there's going to be lots of great clips to extract from this. And thanks for taking the time.
Dude, I mean, I'm happy to, you know, just continue this conversation, you know,
on and off screen, however it makes sense. But I think you're, there's tons of overlap in
the things you're curious about and care about and the stuff that, you know, the trees we're
barking at as well. So, so much overlap. It's kind of shocking, like all the names you were saying
are people that I've been curious about. And the books you were mentioning were ones that I,
like, I feel like if we were two planets, we're like, our orbits are kind of like
getting pretty close to each other. Totally. Yeah. Totally. All right,
well, thank you so much.
