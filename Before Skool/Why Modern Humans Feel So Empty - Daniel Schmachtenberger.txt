People who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness
Mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were
Mostly don't know how many of their pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away how much of the
Striving is actually a result of
Emptiness from living in an environment in which we don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature if you spend time with a
Indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language of all the animals
most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they don't know how to communicate to the animals that they don't know what the
whole world around them is saying all the time and
That their mind is never still in quiet. So it's hard to feel bad about missing something. You've never experienced and you don't know exists
Also when the addict is coming down
They don't want happiness. They want a hit of the supply, right? If somebody's coming down on heroin
They don't want to see a beautiful sunset. They don't want a deep conversation with a friend
Everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing
It's actually dead in their ability to get happiness from lots of things. So there are reward circuits in us that are more addictive
There are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually
In so the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike
And then it will drop you and then you that makes a craving for another spike
And obviously sugar does this and likes on social media do this and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and
etc
most of the things in our world do some version of this and
then in the low then you crave more of that thing and
So you get of course more bipolar type experience, but you also get an erosion of your baseline over time
You need there's less and less things that make you happy you more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them
The types of reward circuits that lead to psychologically physiologically
Healthy people are ones that don't give you as much spike as quickly but raise your baseline over time
And so the type of reward you get from exercising the type of reward you get from like
Meaningful conversation with friends from helping somebody from time in nature
You get reward circuits from those things, but they're different in kind than the reward circuits
You get from fast food or from porn or from social media or those other things
But it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side
It's very hard to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed you will say or what you wish you had spent all of your time with
Every person on their deathbed says I wish I had spent more time with my family and with my kids and with the people that I loved and
Telling them that I love them and working less and pursuing things less and and none of it
Hits that they were spending their life pursuing are at all meaningful in those reflections
But because the supply side can basically market to the addictive impulse better
And it's important to understand that like from a business perspective
Especially once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit, you're like legally bound to that as a director of public corporation
one of the core goals is maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer and
Addiction is awesome for a lifetime revenue of a customer
so when you look at the emergence of fast food and
Processed foods whether we're talking about hostesses and Twinkies or candies or Coke or McDonald's
They're basically combinations of salt
fat and sugar
Different combinations of that with different texture profiles
They were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction. There were lots of split tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again
Yet the reason that people in an evolutionary environment the reason that
Things that had salt and fat and sugar gave people more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment
Pre-agriculture those things were very rare. It was hard to get much of them
And so if you got them there was an incentive to go find the things that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful
As soon as we make them hyper abundance then people are dying of the excess of them
We built a world we're not actually genetically fit to and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to
navigate it well
But it's also that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and minerals and a lot of other nutrients
Simultaneously so the fast food removes all the micronutrients
Optimizes those things optimizes addiction and so you can have people who are actually dying of malnutrition while they're obese
Because they are so deficient in micronutrients and
So what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part and strip out what
Why where we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment strip out all of what's good in it is also what social media
relationships are to human relationships is
also what porn is to
human intimacy is
Also, what the news is to the desire to understand the world you live in is
What productivity is relative to meaning?
Right stripping out a very narrow aligned with the interest of the market hit
That still has that same thing then you will feel a need for greater and greater productivity
and of course
that is great from a GDP maximizing perspective and not great from a deathbed reflections or the
Quality of how children are raised or the quality of the environment perspective
