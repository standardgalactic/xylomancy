This is the first ever conversation between two of my favourite cultural commentators,
the writers Paul Kingsnorth and Mary Harrington, and it's all about the overlaps between their
thought and their analysis of what we're calling the war on reality.
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine, all the time in the writing I'm doing
at the moment. It's not my word I've stolen from writers like D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell
and Aldous Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years.
And I'm really talking about this giant techno-industrial monstrosity that is in our heads
and in the world, which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see, and the project
of modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on God and consequently,
we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place within that.
I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere to frame this in terms of what you call the machine Paul
wants to turn everything into standing reserve. It wants to enclose everything.
It started with the commons and then it started patenting things and now it's moving on to
patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences. I invited them to dialogue because I had an
intuition they'd be able to go deep together and this went even better than I expected.
I think it's a really important development in the cultural conversation and I'll come back
and explain why at the end. So, hope you enjoy it. Paul Kings North, Mary Harrington, welcome.
Thanks for having me. Good to be here. So, this is, I believe, the first time that you
both have been in dialogue with each other. You've both written for Unheard. So, you've been
in the same online magazine and there's a lot of overlaps between your thinking. So,
I'm really looking forward to this conversation and as I thought maybe it'd be good to start maybe
with asking you each because I know you've both been looking forward to being in dialogue with
each other. What it is that you are looking forward to talking about and what you find
interesting in each other's thought before we dive into some of the topics we prepared.
I like Paul's conception of the machine. I'd be happy to talk about that for an hour and a half.
Yeah, I mean, I think we're coming at the same thing from a different perspective actually. I
really like, I love the notion of reactionary feminism actually. Apart from being a great catch
phrase, it actually really opens up a lot of really necessary questions about and not just about
women's issues either, but just broadly about limits and the body and nature.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, you get it. I do get it because you're coming from a feminist perspective
at the same sort of stuff I think I'm writing about from whatever perspective I write.
The moment you start thinking about reactionary feminism, you realise it's reactionary eco-feminism
and then you're away. Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose what I would say I'm coming from, I suppose,
is my background as a former environmental activist, somebody who writes and thinks about
the natural world a lot and you don't have to do that for very long before you realise that
obviously we're intimately a part of it and the whole thing is a question of limits and whether
or not we can break them. And then the questions about the body and the questions about women's
and men's bodies and the questions about the reality of being human and the questions about
rainforests and climate change turn out to be the same questions, which is how we live within limits.
Good, well, that's it, we've dealt with everything. So that's good, thanks David.
Great, Mary and Paul, thank you very much.
Yeah, that's it, that's the tweet, that's what it says.
Yeah, that's a really great introduction. And as you said, Paul, the idea is that somehow the
modern world seems to be in conflict with itself or at least with the natural world.
And this is something you've touched on in your writing, and Mary, you've touched on as well.
Could we start by framing that? How do you see that from the sort of biggest picture?
Well, as opposed to my case, I use this word, the machine all the time in the writing I'm doing
at the moment. It's not my word I've stolen from writers like D. H. Lawrence and George Orwell and
August Huxley and everyone else who was paying attention for the last 100 years. And I'm really
talking about this giant techno industrial monstrosity that is in our heads and in the world,
which is really the project of modernity as far as I can see. And the project of
modernity is to build a machine to replace God, because we've given up on God and consequently
we've given up on limits and living within the natural world and our place within that.
And we've decided that through the use of technology, science and reason,
we can effectively build a new world which doesn't seem to limit us in any way. And we've decided that
any limits at all, whether they're the limits that our body provides or the limits that the
natural world provides us with or the limits of even the limits of our behaviour towards each other
are disgraceful chains that prevent us from being free and rational and individuals. And so I
think it's a big, it's just a very big, very old way of seeing that is manifesting itself in
silicon and plastic all around us. And as I say, coming at that from the perspective of an
environmentalist or a former one, what I saw was the green movement being entirely sucked into
this way of seeing. And I became, I became a greener years ago because I was entranced by the
smallest, beautiful model that the greens used to believe in in the 70s. When I was a little boy,
you know, the world of EF Schumacher and Leopold Korr and Gandhi and Tolstoy and everyone else who
told us to live within natural limits in a way that would actually be nourishing to us. And the
green movement instead bought into this machine thinking in which it saw climate change and
other issues as technological problems to be solved with more technology, all of which sucks us into
the same project of busting down limits. So now environmentalism has become a question of how
many wind farms you can get up and whether you should use nuclear power and GM crops and whether
you should do X, Y and Z to effectively create a, quote, sustainable limitless machine world.
All paths kind of lead back to this modern way of seeing almost every question. I mean,
Mary comes at this from, from, from, as far as I can see from the angle of, you know, from the
feminist angle, but as she says, it's, it's the same question actually, you can just approach it
in from all of your different sort of personal perspectives. And it all leads you back to this
attitude we have to nature and human nature. Yeah, I agree. I suppose I sort of come,
I found myself coming at it from the perspective of the things that you can't say from within that
model and rather direct experience, particularly of what it is about being a mother that you can't
put into words from within the model. And I've theorized, I've borrowed from Heidegger elsewhere
to frame this in terms of, you know, of what you call the machine pool. See, it wants to turn
everything into standing reserve, you know, it wants to, it wants to enclose everything.
You know, it started with the commons and then it started patenting things and now it's moving
on to patenting people's bodies and genetic sequences and you know, but it wants to,
it wants to move things from being naturally occurring to biosemiotic, you know,
relationships with one another to being inert resources that can be instrumentalized and
ideally commodified and turned into, turned into something that can be used for something and
sort of unmoored from its relational context. That's the basic movement, unmoor something from
its relational context and then turn it into things which can be traded back and forth in a
sort of liquid and limitless way. So if that's the basic model, the problem with that from the
perspective of a feminist and a mother is that everything that matters, everything that's important
about being a mother is impossible, you can't, is not visible within that model. Because all
of mothering is about pattern and all mothering is about repetition, you know, it's about,
it's about showing up for your baby every day in all the little ways that are important because
the baby's completely dependent on you and all the, all the things which are nice about it
are impossible to frame in those, in terms of the machine because they can't be commodified.
I mean, you know, it's easy to sort of wax sentimental about your baby's first laugh.
But yeah, I think a lot of mothers will relate to the experience of getting to the end of the day
and having had actually a lovely day, but then somebody asks them, oh, what did you do today?
And you, you can't say, you just can't sum it up because you did stuff and you were there and it
was in the moment and just the day went by and bits of it were probably really boring. But if
you try and explain it to somebody from the perspective that's outside the relationship
and that sort of dynamic business of kind of sustaining a tiny dependent person, if you like,
with the, with the energy and your, with your own body and your own way of being in the world,
and you try and explain that sort of dynamic activity to somebody who isn't part of it and
who isn't within those relationships with you, they'll just be like, well, that sounds pretty
dull and repetitive. And it kind of is, you know, I mean, if you have a, if you have a functioning
brain and an education, it does get boring after a bit, but it's also really important and it's
also really lovely. And I mean, this is, you know, as somebody with a functioning brain and an
education and also a deep, deep love of my daughter, these are all things which I've kind of wrestled
with and found myself theorizing as well as doing. And I've, and I've come to realize that it's,
it's another, it's another angle on the same problem that I think Paul is wrestling with,
which is about how the things, the things which matter and the things which sustain us
and the things which are meaning making and the things which are genuinely sustainable and create
sustainable life in relation to other life are all pattern-based. Then none of them are,
none of them are information-based, they're all meaning-based. And information, if you like,
is blind to meaning, because meaning, meaning in here is in pattern and repetition and the
everyday and the ordinary and the relational. And the moment you turn it into standing reserve,
the moment you enclose it, instrumentalize it and send it out as inert stuff to be liquefied
in one sort of a market or another, it becomes information and it stops being meaningful. The
moment you commodify a child that, I mean, you understand, you understand where I'm going.
Yeah, and we are there, aren't we? We are pretty much commodifying children already.
Yes, we are literally commodifying children. There's a whole, there are rows and rows of
cots in bombshells as in Ukraine, where children which were commissioned by parents elsewhere
in a rented uterus are waiting for their commissioning parents to come and collect them.
I say parents in the loosest possible sense. This is not, this is not a form of parenthood,
which I recognize as such. But yes, we are commodifying children at this point.
We're commodifying everything. And I think that the notion of enclosure is really important. I
keep coming back to this one as well, again and again and again. I mean, you could argue that
this whole process begins literally with the enclosures, land enclosures in Britain,
in from the, say, the 15th century onwards. And, you know, global capitalism, if you like,
global industrialism is a process of enclosing everything. So you start off with the land,
then you go on to the workers, then you go on to the human body, you go on to the natural
world. Everything's enclosed. And it's also a process of making everybody rootless and making
everything rootless. It's about, if Mary talks about relationships, I suppose I talk about roots,
which is pretty much a different way of saying the same thing. If you're rooted in a place,
if you're rooted in your relationship with a family, if you're rooted in your own body,
if you're rooted in the environment around you, then you have something which,
as Mary says, you can't actually commodify. You can't commodify that sense of being.
Well, you can, but, and they do. But in the real sense of what it actually means to be human,
it's not measurable. But everything has to be measurable in the age of the machine. It has
to be measurable. It has to be commodifiable. It has to be profitable. Because that's the only
way we can measure whether we're progressing. And of course, we must always progress towards
something better by enclosing and by uprooting and by turning everything into a standing reserve.
And that actually breaks the business of being human in the world. It breaks. I mean, you talk
a lot about sense making, David, and you can't sense make it. If you can't make sense of any of
these relationships, if they've been broken. And I do think that so much of the kind of madness
in the culture at the moment, apart from being driven by social media, is also just actually
being driven by the destruction of things, which for millennia, we've thought were completely
normal, including what motherhood is and what fatherhood is and what families are and what it
means to be in a place. All of this kind of stuff that nobody had to question much. Now,
suddenly, everything has to be questioned. And there aren't really answers, because it doesn't
make sense. Yeah, I want to, it's a good question. And I wonder whether this is going to help make
more sense or less sense, bringing in the sort of metaphysical dimension, because you both
talk about this. And the concept that people may or may not be familiar with the kind of
Gnosticism, the idea that this is a very deep rooted pattern of thinking where the real world is
somehow fake is somehow kind of an illusion. And actually, there's a sort of inner essence that
is real, is sort of very much mimicked. I think both of you have referred to this in your writings
as kind of mimicked in the way that our attitude to the world now seems to be. And so I wonder,
do you think that kind of, I'd love to hear about the sort of the metaphysical frame that you
are both bringing, and also whether you think that that kind of makes things more intelligible or
less? I've used the phrase fully automated luxury Gnosticism. With a slightly flippantly,
I've borrowed it from Aaron Bostani's book, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, where he imagines that
actually left wing utopia is going to be attained by the automation of everything, presumably the
liquefaction translation of everything into standing reserve, which is just going to bring
about a world of eternal abundance for everyone somehow. With apologies to Bostani, I've not
actually read the book, but I gather that that's the gist of it, Fully Automated Luxury Communism.
So I borrowed that for Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, which is, well, I don't believe it's
coming, but I think it's an aspiration which is being sold to us, of which the reality is perhaps
less appealing. If you like, it's Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism is this kind of high sounding
promise that we're all going to be able to escape the constraints of our body into something
into a miraculous world where really we can do anything, whether that's the metaverse and
with a haptic interface that means somehow we can see and feel and touch and taste
things in this imaginary digitally constructed world. And we'll never actually need to have any
kind of reference back to what's happening in our physical, in the physical plane at all.
Or, you know, any number of other sort of techno fixes for the problems of materiality and the
problems of embodiment. I suppose it's one of those things where I sort of mean first and ask
questions later, or decide what it is I mean by it. Well, I mean, you often end up, I mean,
I started, I did that with reactionary feminism as well, and it's completely turned into a thing.
So sometimes, sometimes it's just good to go, it's good to walk backwards for a bit and see
where you end up. So yeah, I mean, Paul, Fully Automated Luxury Gnosticism, you know, can we,
can we fully automate it? How luxurious would it be? You know, how Gnostic is it?
It is interesting that this, the notion of Gnosticism is floating around a bit at the moment. So
historically, the Gnostic movement was a sort of very loose collection of beliefs that were
around in the early centuries of the Christian church, and the Christian church declared them
heretical because effectively Gnosticism says, as you suggest, David, that this world is either,
is either fake or it's something to be transcended. So what you do with, I mean, Gnosis literally means
knowledge. It means a kind of secret knowledge. So the Gnostic movement is, is promoted and still
promotes actually the idea that you can escape the body and the physical realm if you have the
right kind of secret knowledge. And the Christians said and say that this is a heresy because
Christianity is embodied. Just as Christ was a kind of melding of the human and the divine,
that's what we are. And so Christianity is not, the Christian claim is not that we're going to
escape from physical reality and float off to somewhere better. It's that physical reality
can be transformed. Whereas the Gnostic say, no, this is basically a hell. And the Gnostic tradition
also has the, has this great notion of the demiurge. There's an evil being who thinks he's God,
and he is the one who has created matter. And so matter is inherently evil. And so the human
spirit is a divine spark trapped in matter, and we want to escape from it back to the,
back to the place where we belong. So it's not much of a leap from that to Mark Zuckerberg's
metaverse. It's not much of a leap from that to what Silicon Valley is doing. I mean, openly doing
and openly talking about, which is attempting to transcend the messy horribleness of physical
reality so that we don't have to die, so that we don't have to give birth, so that we don't have to
be the sex that we were born, so that we don't have to be anything that's actually relational
and anything that limits what we imagine our free will is. This is my daughter visiting the podcast
there, because it's so interesting. Yeah, so that's, I mean, and it is exactly that that's the
Gnostic promise today. And it's, it's the notion that the physical reality of stuff is escapable,
but this time we're not doing it through secret Gnostic religious knowledge, we're doing it through
technology, which is our equivalent of that. And it's no joke to say that this is exactly where
the project is headed, you only have to listen to Ray Kurzweil speaking or any of these other guys
in Silicon Valley, Elon Musk or any of them, they're very open about this. It's the,
it's the great dream of where we're supposed to end up. And I think Mary's right, we're not going
to get there because of all sorts of actual physical realities that are going to get in the way.
But I think we're going to do a lot of damage as we attempt to. And I also think it's an elite
project, you know, this is not something that's available to the majority of humanity. This is,
you know, this is something you do in your New Zealand bunker, primarily.
Well, there are some, there are deep photographs during the rounds of people where, you know,
homeless guys with metaverse golfers on. And actually, that's good. It's egalitarian at least.
Right. Right. Right. I think also an incredibly bleak advert for the metaverse itself,
which I think accidentally says the quiet part out loud, where some washed up old dog who used
to have a great life being the life and soul of the party or, you know, loved and surrounded by
friends and is now lonely and, you know, doesn't live on his own and miserable and, you know,
but basically has a crap life and comes into the metaverse and just makes it all come back again,
but fictionally and digitally created. And that's a happy ending to the story.
Well, in fact, what the advert is saying very clearly is if you have a shit life,
come and sit in the metaverse, then you can pretend it's not so shit.
You know what it always strikes? This is good news, apparently.
Yeah. I mean, this is like the matrix written from the point of view of a script in which
Agent Smith is the good guy, isn't it? This is where we are. We've been 20 years on,
we're 20 years on. And we've just we're telling the same story, but now it's good news. Yeah.
And as you said, I don't actually think we're going to get there because it's somebody still
has to take the bins out, bluntly. I mean, this again is the feminist point. You know,
somebody still has to do the dishes. And even if it's a machine does the dishes,
someone still has to unload the dishwasher. You know, so it is eventually titles all the way
down. Somebody still has to grow the food. And and all of and even if you build robots to grow
the food, somebody's got to service the robots. And then somebody's got to do the dishes for them
somewhere at the bottom is somebody doing the dishes. And they're probably not in the metaverse
while they're doing the dishes. So yeah, it's an elite project at the end of the day. And someone
somewhere is cleaning up the rubbish that's left behind after the big party.
Yeah, and you had a really interesting insight as well that there's a kind of the the memetic
warfare that goes alongside or the information warfare that goes alongside it seems to be more
and more about any kind of hint of fixity or reality is now called essentialism is now kind of to be
attacked memetically, I guess. And that that I find a really interesting development.
Not just essentialism, it's fascism. To state that limits exist and continue to exist,
no matter how hard you push against them is is now is now framed straightforwardly as fascist.
You know, even if you're just observing something which is there, you know, the the act of noticing
it is makes you crypto fascist. Yeah, it's a very, very interesting one. This this whole
notion of essentialism, which has become such a blue word on the left. And as Mary says,
very quickly becomes an accusation of fascism. Apart from being a stupid representation of
actually what fascism is, it's just very, it's very telling that the people who use that language
who always self, self titled progressives believe that as you say, any any kind of limits, any
kind of actual roots in the natural world is is not only evil, but it's somehow associated with
the like the worst political project in human history. And it's, you know, it's not it's not
just, it's not even just a smear, it's like there's a real belief in this, you know, there's
there's a real sense that if you are talking about limits being either even real or beneficial,
or having to live within, say, your own body or live with the natural world as it is or whatever
it is, then you are somehow pushing at the door of some kind of vicious ethnocentric
racial warfare or whatever it is. And it's like, it's almost like people have had their minds bent
by the machine to believe that if you actually have to live within the God given limits of nature,
or if you use a phrase like that, then, you know, you're such a troubling person that you have to
be removed. So who's left? The only people who are left are people who believe there are no limits
at all. And in this kind of merger of, I suppose, progressive left ideology and machine,
Gnosticism, it's very weird, and it's happening very quickly as well. And it's almost impossible
in some cases to have conversations, you know, about this without, as Mary says, having that
having the F word thrown at you, which is, yeah, again, I think in other in another maybe more
sane parts of the world, and in other more sane times, these conversations are possible,
they were possible five years ago, 10 years ago, you know, you could sit around talking about all
this Huxley, and there would be no problem. But suddenly, it's accelerated into a very strange
place. I mean, it does, it depends a little bit where you stand and who you're speaking to. I
think just a very immediate example, my very good friend, Louise Perry, who's recently written a book
about the case against the sexual revolution, when which she argues for, I mean, her background
is as a broadly left liberal feminist, who's sort of, but working, but worked in a rape shelter and
left her questioning a lot of a lot of what she had internalized about what the sexual revolution
meant, who it was for, and what it was actually doing. And so she's written a whole book about
her perspective on this with chapter titles that I would think sort of would have been,
as you say, five years ago, very difficult to argue with, like, loveless sex is not empowering,
people are not commodities, you know, listen to your mother, all sort of fairly, fairly sensible,
you would think straightforward statements to make. And somebody, somebody of, you know, within
within the Academy, posted the screenshot of her chapter headings today, saying this is a real mask
off moment, you know, look at this, look at the horrors which are which are coming forth from,
you know, the various other sort of imputations of the F word. And I mean, but the, and was then
then received quite a lot of replies to the effect of which bit of people are not commodities are
you objecting to? And really, really, the response was, though, there is nothing here that any of
us disagree with, you know, this is actually not really this is this is this is this all sounds
very sensible, which which indeed it does, you know, loveless sex really is not empowering,
certainly not to women anyway. But there are, I suppose what I'm trying to say is there are a
lot of people out there who see this stuff, and feel endlessly, wordlessly frustrated with this
stuff. And don't just just aren't really sure how to mobilize against this stuff, because it's
because the the sort of integrated messaging apparatus which is transmitting it seems
seemed very well articulated and very, very sort of all encompassing. But actually, it isn't.
Actually, it isn't through the cracks, people still have eyes and functioning brains.
Because because this would be a sort of pushback sorry to interrupt this would be a sort of pushback,
I think, saying, Well, maybe there are, because with social media, especially, it's very easy to
make any kind of case and say, Well, everyone thinks this one, actually, maybe it's just a few
people. Because the pushback would be, okay, maybe there's a few people who are kind of saying that
this person's a fascist for for asserting that there are kind of gender roles or whatever. But is
this not kind of not picking kind of extreme examples rather than kind of a wider mood or
a wider kind of feeling? Well, I think the sort of I would say there's two ways of looking at that.
It's very difficult to discern what public opinion actually is now, because Twitter both is and is
not the real world. And you know, and also, you know, there are, I think you can you can argue
about how how impactful a silent majority actually is, compared to the concerted efforts of a very
small group of extremely committed zealots, which you know, I think if you look at history, it
tend to be more effective than any any amount of silent majority. So, so from that perspective,
you know, the cards are the cards are stacked in favor of the fully automated luxury nostics,
because they have the mic and they really, really, really believe this stuff. But
I don't know, I think there are, I think that I really think there are hard limits to it. You
know, there are hard limits to how how much women as has been very abundantly evident in
Britain recently, and increasingly so in America too, there are limits to how much women will
tolerate being told that a woman is anybody who says they're a woman, for example, you know,
which is which is the most egregious and the most in your face, battlefront in the in the
the push for no limits whatsoever, or in turn, in individual self actualization on any terms
whatsoever. That's the most sort of that that's the most egregious front in that particular.
I mean, there are there are many others. But it's also it's also the one which is mobilizing the most
sort of cross party resistance. Because I mean, if you've grown, if you've grown a new human
inside your literal uterus, you know what a woman is. And it's also notable how many of the people
how many of the men who pay lip service to this idea that a woman is anybody who says they're
or when immediately knows what a woman is the moment they want to render uterus. You know, there
are these all this stuff is very it's it's full of slippages and it's full of bad faith and it's
full of inconsistency and everybody knows that to be the case. Because at the end of the day,
you know, the the liquefaction of everything, I've just been writing a chapter about this
actually, you know, is that the this the the liquefaction of everything doesn't actually work
because because it's premised on the idea that there's no such thing as nature and no such
thing as human nature. And that's not actually true. So what it does in the end is it it successfully
liquefies all of the norms or all of these established structures. But because because
human nature continues to exist, it then it simply reframes that as a set of supply and
demand problems. So instead of instead of having, you know, codes for in the instead of having courtship
rituals, you have the sexual marketplace. And that's a straightforward reordering of the the
sex differences between men and women, you know, which, you know, had quite elaborate social codes
ordered around them, you know, in order to kind of balance the balance the interests of men and
women, you know, under particular economic circumstances, you liquefy that you blow it
all out of the water and say, no, actually, everybody can just do what they want now.
But and what what happens is not that everybody does what they want. Exactly what have because
people still people still have urges which are not rational. And some of those are connected to
our reproductive roles, they just are. But but instead, but and because this stuff goes on
existing, it just it just gets reabsorbed into the marketplace, and it becomes a set of supply and
demand problems. And the same the same is now happening with biological sex, you know, it's
either being, you know, the desire to be one sex or another is being is being reimagined as a set
of supply and demand problems. You know, there are already medical papers out there, we are talking
about, you know, uterus transplants into men who men who identify as women. I don't know where they're
going to get the uterus is from, but presumably from from women who identify as men or who knows,
who knows anyway, there's this is being imagined as you know, a set of Lego parts that could just
be swapped so that they're in the right place, presumably through some sort of marketplace.
And the same goes again for babies, you know, women are still the only people who can just
date new humans. So so here again, because we were we're in the process of liquefying all of the
norms. But but we haven't in the process successfully managed to abolish the underlying
material facts, you know, on which those norms are built, we just end up we end up reimagining
them as a set of supply and demand problems. So now if you need a uterus, you just go and rent one.
And but the point is the liquefaction doesn't work. And so the and my sense is there's a
there's a kind of frustration there among the automated luxury nostics, because every time
they try and every time they try and get to the bottom, to the point where actually we really
have just attained full grey goo Satanism. It just never quite works because it's because there's
always there's always another level of materiality, which has its patterns and continues to be what
it is. And I, it's very depressing, very pessimistic sort of a hope. But I do, I have some,
you know, if I have hope, it's in the fact that that that persists. It just is. And it doesn't
matter how many times you try and liquefy, it continues. Yeah, and I think that's really,
that's a great summary of it all. I mean, this is, I've written quite a few times in these
essays, I'm doing at the moment about the, how revolutions effectively, especially progressive
revolutions always clear the ground for the machine. They think they're creating a utopia.
And what actually happens from the French Revolution onwards, is you destroy all the
customary structures, you destroy the traditions, you destroy the structures from families to
community level structures up to church level, you literally, you know, you burn down the churches
and you try to destroy the family and you read it to be the land. And what happens then is you
just create a void and into the void commerce rushes. And so as Mary says, everything becomes
commodified. And so the result of your grand utopian progressive revolution is not a fairer
world. It's effectively a world that is more commodified, more individualistic, and more,
more prey to the machine. And that brings us to the point after about 200 years that we've got to
now where everything is a commodity. But there are a lot of people who consider themselves to be
progressive who have confused out with liberation. And this is really what liberation has come down
to, as Mary is also saying better than me, is liberation from nature at all levels,
liberation from the body, liberation from everything around you. And this, I think,
explains the kind of the people who scream about fascism and the people who are so committed to
this is they genuinely think, well, effectively, they're blanks, latest, right, they genuinely
believe that if you can remove all of the supposed change, the tires down from from the reality of
biological sex to the existence of family to national culture to whatever it is that you
think is getting in the way of equality in utopia, then we're all then we're all the same. And then
we can indeed all choose to have babies ought to be men ought to be women ought to live anywhere
ought to be whatever we want. But that's not true because we're hefty, you know, we're hefty and
we're rooted in whatever cultural or background or biology we have. And there are some things you
shouldn't you can't get away from. But also you shouldn't want to because they actually make you
human. And that's the thing that there's this notion that these structures that have always in
most societies and most times been customary from the family to the village to the religious
institution, whatever it is, that they are bad things which which limit us as opposed to the
possibility that they are actually things which enriches and which structure our urges in useful
ways. And that's that's the point where can I have to probably painfully rediscover that we
probably built these structures for a reason. And we lived in certain ways for a reason. And
however imperfect those ways might have been for lots of people. And they're hardly unimprovable.
They still probably built on a knowledge of human nature that we're now pretending isn't there
anymore. And yeah, we're getting to the point where we've deconstructed almost everything.
And as Mary said, there's a kind of there's a grinning face at the bottom of it is not looking
good. Yeah, I've come I've come gradually to the conclusion that actually gender ideology is mostly
particularly transgender children. It's all being instrumentalised, you know, there are some
seriously distressed people who are for all men or a number of range of different often quite
complicated, you know, personally very painful reasons, you're deeply unhappy in their bodies
and in the world as it is. You know, and I think that's that's often a rational response to
finding themselves in a very absolutely intolerable place, you know, particularly adolescent women
who find themselves in a world so saturated with porn that actually to me it seems a completely
reasonable response to take hormones that make that make you resemble a male and cut off your
breasts. I mean, I would probably be tempted if I were 14 today. So, you know, from from that
point of view, I have no I have no beef with with people who are trying to find some relief
in in a embodied condition that they find intolerable. You know, that's not who I pick a
fight with. But what what I see is a subset of very distressed people who are being instrumentalised
in pursuit of a much bigger project, which is the deregulation of human nature as such.
If you like the deregulation of the of the human body, you know, much the same way as the financial
sector was deregulated in the 1980s, the aim is to deregulate the body and deregulate the idea
that we had that the body has a nature, because that opens that opens up a boundless commercial
sphere in which, you know, organs regenerate, self regenerating organs can be synthesised in
laboratories. Human animal chimeras can be developed for who knows what purposes. I mean,
you know, the possibilities are endless if you're a mad scientist with no no ethics. But you have to
you have to render an inexcusably low status, any sort of the the currently still pervasive
common conviction act with truth, in fact, not conviction truth, that humans have a nature.
And that, you know, males are normatively one way and females are normatively another and,
you know, humans have a normal number of limbs and so on and so forth. You have to you have to
completely denormalise destabilise and liquefy that consensus before you before you can embark on
the, you know, deregulatory business opportunities that flow from that. Yeah, no, I think that's
right. That's exactly what's happening. And the demonising of the of the turfs and the fascists
and everybody else is precisely part of that project, which is to silence and to provide
endless new names for the people who are saying exactly that.
Really interesting what you're saying about the like, what is the sort of the question that
arises like what's the most fundamental driver because you you mentioned Paul that you felt like
commerce was filling the gap of this sort of revolutionary moment. But are you saying that
you think commerce is is actually the driver or is the driver deeper is the driver some kind of
I mean you've called it the machine but how where do you think that machine lives do you think it's
kind of a psychological structure or a yeah what what do you think is actually because it's also
kind of for me kind of maps onto some of the conspiracy thinking as well where I see a lot
of the time people kind of collapse around looking for an agent a specific agent or a specific set
of agents, whereas actually there is a sort of tendency towards often that seems deeper. So
where where do you locate those those drivers? Yeah, well, I have a terrible feeling that the
driver is metaphysical. I mean, this is not just about making money. There's a lot of interest
in that but there's I keep I always talk about this fascinating book by Kevin Kelly called
What Technology Wants which is a really good book to read. You should read it Mary if you
haven't already it's a few years old now but it's Kevin Kelly's one of the Silicon Valley guys and
he's he's he's very much into the notion that something is being created which he calls the
technium which is pretty much the same as I suppose why I'm calling the machine.
And he says look this thing is becoming self-aware and that's the point right it's starting to
manage itself it's starting to push its own direction starting to starting to manifest and
this is again the attitude of a lot of the guys behind this project that they think they're creating
the next they think they're building the next level of evolutionary consciousness. You know,
this is why they're so obsessed at the moment I think with artificial intelligence. They really
think they can create post-humans and they think perhaps this is Kevin Kelly's explicit notion
that humanity is just a stepping stone on the on the on the way to something greater a greater
consciousness that they're helping to build but which is also weirdly manifesting through them.
So it's a it's a very quasi-religious thing that is happening. I'm not saying everybody
involved in it believes that there's a lot of profiteering just and a lot of kind of
mind is following the herd but there's something going on with the creation of this post-human
metaverse machine machinist sort of post-human anti-human non-human world in which it literally
is it's a metaphysical project in which they're trying to recreate or or build a heaven on earth
entirely reconstructed. I mean you hear it a lot when people talk about how they want to go and live
in they want to terraform Mars or they want to fly off and live on on moon bases because that's
the fantasy it's the explicit fantasy of how they can create an entire planet right from the right
from the dust up in their own image. So there's something in it that is very much bigger than
just a kind of profit scrabble. And again you don't need a conspiracy theory in which there
are six evil people in a bunker making a plan. You just need enough people to buy into something
which is moving already which I think is where we're going and it's kind of the inevitable
result of the whole attitude the whole worldview of modernity I think to come back to what we
started with with the the notion of the rational individual who can detach himself from nature
and and build his own paradise. Now we've got the technology to do it but we will have soon
and that's really what encompasses the whole thing I think so it's a it's an ideology or even a
religious worldview that drives it I think. You said I feel like you're sidling along the edge of
implying that it's not so much that we have ideas as that ideas have us.
Yeah well I think that's true I suppose yeah that's not a bad way of putting it.
We are I mean I think you see this really manifesting on social media it's one reason I
don't have any social media accounts it's people are being entirely controlled by
ideas and by visions and by ideologies or whatever these things are they're not you know
the great the famous I support the current thing meme is is quite funny but it's also
has a kind of deeper meaning to it which is that you know this you know you're being controlled
when you're on your smartphone looking at this stuff you can feel it and so yeah ideas have us
memes have us metaphysics have us entirely I think and that and they can almost become
self-replicating in the age of the machine and they are. I would agree with that I mean I'm
hopelessly compromised in that way Paul and I'm for fully fully cognizant of my cyborg state.
Well you're you're so good at meming Mary it would be a shame if you you know if you thought.
Well you can't be completely unplugged if you've noticed that.
No I'm not completely unplugged no I do I do pop in here and there and you know one of the
reasons I don't have social media is that I know very well because I did have a Twitter account
for a while years ago that I know very well that I would get tempted to start doing exactly the
same thing I'd get sucked into that really easily it's not it's not a puritan position so much as
a practical one I know it would rot my brain so I keep away. Yeah I'm very ambivalent about my
own relationship to Twitter but one I suppose the thing I wanted to lob in here which is it's a
conversation I've had a number of times with you know other people who are sort of you know embedded
in this in the cyborg memeplex as I am who will who'll cheerfully chat to you about the fact that
they know perfectly well that the memeplex that you see on the internet is you know that the
memeplex is real but the what you the simulacrum of it you see on the internet is not it's not the
thing and who can who can see the difference very clearly now I suspect that there are a lot of
people who support the current thing you can't see the difference but there are there are a
surprising number of people out there who see what the what the internet memeplex is a metaphor for
and recognise that it actually exists and is out there. See what it's a metaphor for what do you
mean by that? Well I mean it's actually what it's a metaphor for is the thing that we started off
talking about you know when you when you were referenced I was talking about patterns and
meanings and the relational the relational nature of everything in in human culture and the natural
world. We are another person if we're well we're talking about you know people shadow people who
should be part of this conversation you know a dear friend of mine Wendy Wheeler who died a
couple of years ago who was a pioneer in biosemiotics wrote a lot about her work was very it was
multidisciplinary and it crossed and it was based on the thesis that everything in the natural world
is not it's not based on information it's based on meaning everything in the natural world is a
series of relational dialogues between different meaning making systems which I found an incredibly
illuminating way of thinking about how how organisms exist in relation to one another.
I think one of the classic examples is you know that there's a lovely video about this somewhere
on the internet what happened what happened when they reintroduced wolves into so into a national
park in America and through a concatenating series of impacts that reintroducing the apex predator had
on various various natural systems through the sort of you know concatenating interrelations of
these various systems it ended up changing the path of the rivers that ran through the
run through the nature reserve because because some wolves ate some more some more large animals
there were there was a different sort of vegetation and that meant smaller animals went over there
instead and that in turn meant something else and something else and something else and eventually
the rivers changed course and that's what I mean when I say that the memeplex is real
because in a sense the normative pattern behaviors of each of these species acting in
relationship to one another you know acts like a series it's metaphorically speaking you could say
it's a series of means that that exist in dynamic dialogue with one another and in the course of
doing that you know they and that that process if you like manifests in in what we see materially in
the natural world and I suppose that's probably that's probably the clearest articulation I can give
of what I think the actual memeplex is and that's and that memeplex if you like the the actual
memeplex is not one in which humans exist as separate from the natural world because obviously
we're we're having impacts on the natural world all the time I suppose one of the I keep chickens
at home stop me if this is getting getting too weird or too lateral for you I keep chickens I
think a lot about chickens because I like chickens you know they're kind of psychopathic and they're
kind of time miniature dinosaurs and other things but but they're also one of the most successful
bird species on I think they might be the most successful bird species on the planet and they've
done that by existing in a dialogue with humans you know they're not the only domesticated animal
in that way and obviously a lot of them have to take one for the team but you know at a species
level it's a very effective survival strategy you know I think there are there are countless
billions of chickens in the world and it works from a from a species point of view but you know
unless unless you're a you're a fully paid up member of the machine and you want to keep you
want to keep chickens in battery farms you know if you're if you're keeping if you're
keeping animals like that you sort of you have to you have to do so roughly in accordance with
their nature you can you can exist in a functional you know ongoing sustainable dialogue with a
domestic animal but you know unless you unless you imprison them and and doctor them in various
ways to make them tolerate it you have to you have to keep them in conditions where they can
scratch for example if they're chickens or if they're if they're sheep they need different
conditions and so so there's a there's a kind of ongoing dynamic relationship where you know
who'd be where animal animal husbandry is partly about meeting the animal where it is
and it's partly about partly about how a domestic animal does a species level response to that you
know and over times you know specialist breeds evolve and you know there are there are particular
different types of so sorry I'm probably getting very arcane with this but it's just
you know once you get into those you know the the semiotics of of human animal interactions you
know it's just boundlessly rich terrain you know there are there are there are differences in how
good at giving birth unaided different different breeds of sheep are because I think it's I think
it's a herdwicks which are which are normally kept on very barren upland terrain in the in the north
of england and because you you just can't get up there during lambing season basically the ones the
ones that survive are the ones who can give birth without any help and there are other breeds of
sheep which are kept in lowland territory under much closer watch who are who generally need
help a lot more help with lambing because they over time they've just evolved that way I mean you
can see you can see how that would work you know the herdwicks the the herdwicks that make it are
the ones are the offspring of mothers of use that can that can give birth on their own and and just
over time they've got much better at it and there are other breeds of sheep which are which aren't
and and these are these are the sorts of dynamic interactions between humans and the animal kingdom
or and and I mean you can you can point to any number of different examples I think there's a
another one which I really like is the North American peppered moth which over the last hundred
years has become it's become darker as a consequence of evolving in much more polluted conditions it
used to be it used to be mostly white I think some of them then then they have they have different
patterns and over over the last hundred years they've become darker because the human influence
on their environment has has made for has has meant they need a different color of camouflage in
order to survive so so we're constantly existing in dialogue with the natural world you know with
this sort of memeplex and I think the the fundamental fantasy of the machine that we're somehow
separable from it and entitled to instrumentalize it you know once you if you look at it from
inside the memeplex or you look at it from a perspective of thinking about us as participants
in this and entangled in this enormous sort of multi-species inter-species memeplex it it's
it's a sort of monstrous imposition and just a fundamental category error yeah and this um
this takes me right back to the point about environmentalism that we talked about right
at the beginning really where I come in I suppose you know this is a sort of a conversation about
Gaia theory really this is a conversation about the interconnectedness of all things and the fact
that there's no separation between humans of nature and that we're entirely reliant on everything
else but that living in urban interconnected societies we can very easily pretend that that's
not true until we start keeping chickens um or any any number of other things but it is it is
exactly why it is impossible for the new metaphysics of the machine to succeed in the end because
what it's trying to do is as I say recreate recreate or to create a new world on the basis
that the current world is a standing reserve on the basis that the current world is just a fake
or not a fake but a pure material realm that there's nothing to it that there's no consciousness
why doesn't the human mind that there's no real interconnections that there's nothing
that there's nothing sacred that there's nothing higher than us that there's nothing
that may be operating outside our purview and that's not true and that's not a religious claim
either you can you can read any number of scientific papers these days about the consciousness of
trees and the interconnectedness of fungal mycelia and any number of interesting studies which
demonstrate that things that are not human tend to be a lot more conscious and interconnected
than we might assume in the modern age which incidentally is something that most indigenous
people know instinctively and and and traditionally so that's real so what we are doing precisely
is trying to break apart and instrumentalize and break down into material parts something which
actually is alive that we're part of which is the the planet itself we're playing well literally
playing god except god's god knows what he's doing and we don't and that's why that's why it hits the
buffers and it will keep hitting the buffers and at the micro level you know a human body is a real
thing and you can't you can't change it beyond a certain point and at the macro level there's
something very big and interwoven going on with the planet itself that we don't understand and we
can't and we can't fiddle with beyond a certain point and we're just going to learn it the hard way
that's what's going to happen we're going to learn it the hard way because we don't want to learn it
by paying attention I wanted to throw in a concept around this question of like what's driving it
and I wonder whether you both might have seen there's been a lot of talk recently about the
kind of concept of the egregore and which is a sort of idea of maybe we are all the individual human
brain as connected to a smartphone just choosing to kind of up regulate certain messages or not
based on kind of ideological reasons could be seen as a kind of individual neuron in a in a
wider sort of group consciousness that we're not we don't know where that is going that that's sort
of almost like a that could be do you think that's a useful concept and that could kind of explain
sort of a kind of wider perspective of of of an intention that we're part of but we we don't
fully understand where its destination or direction of travel is yeah well it's an occult concept
isn't it egregore so I've seen a few people chatting about it recently I mean there's
certainly a sense that you can come back to that notion that we're being controlled by something
that's bigger than us and I think fundamentally that is happening through the internet I wrote
quite a fun short story a few years ago called The Basilisk which was all about this which I
quite enjoyed writing I should just write short stories because it's a much quicker way of trying
to explain all this than putting in essays but that was precisely about the note that the possibility
that something is controlling us through to the web whether that something is a sort of a mind
force that we create in some ways or whether it's something else I don't know but there's something
going on which is bigger than us the internet has manifested it and and it's it's part of
the craziness and it's um it's really difficult to pin down but it's people talking about egregores
is one sort of pointer to the fact that people can again feel that there's something much bigger
behind the the weird on-screen interactions that no one can quite explain or put their finger on
well I would love to do a part two where we talk about what we're going to do
what we do now because we've if we've if we've reached the bottom if we've reached
if we've reached the bottom and it's really there really is nowhere further down I mean
there might be a long a long way further down but if we've if we've reached the point where
we've liquefied everything what happens next I think that's a that's a question I would love to
talk over with you no it's a big one yeah how to live through it how to make sense of it how to
how to resist it yeah that would be a that would be a great chat awesome so this is diagnosis and
then we have a follow-up with solution no promises no promises yeah Mary Mary and Paul thank you very
much thank you great so I hope you enjoyed that I really loved the conversation while I was part
of it and I listened to it again afterwards and something really landed so I'm going to try and
explain why I think this is significant maybe you can let me know what you make of this in the
comments I think what this conversation was is a moving towards a synthesis position between
what you might call dissident right and dissident left it's explaining how the extreme woke agenda
is liquefying all structures which is what the right is angry about but Paul explains that ultimately
this is in the interests of capital and it's a corporate agenda which is what the left is upset
about and it also validates the feelings of the conspiracy minded that something coordinated is
going on but locates the source of the problem not in a shadowy cabal but in the metaphysical
what Paul calls the machine and Mary calls fully automated luxury gnosticism so I think this is
inching towards a synthesis position and what's more powerful is the way that they both deliver
their message with wit intelligence and depth and with none of the reactivity and anger that
characterizes so much of this debate so I really do think this is a step forward and I'm looking
forward to hosting them again in dialogue along with rebel wisdom members which we're going to do
soon so if you want to join that conversation check out the membership options below in the
show notes and hope to see you there
