So this is a film about the recent conversation between Jordan Peterson and John Bovakie and
for it I'm joined by Paul van der Klee, how are you doing Paul?
I'm doing well, it's great to be here.
Awesome, yeah and I'm really glad to have you here to kind of make sense of what happened
because it's a conversation that we and a lot of other people were really really looking
forward to, real anticipation seeing Jordan and John together and I think there was a
real split in reaction to it between people going what was that, if you look at the comments
section below it I've never seen so many people respond negatively to Jordan's interruptions
of John, I'd say that's the main sort of theme of the comments which is extraordinary in
itself and but also that there's a lot of, I kind of like it like panning for gold because
there are a lot of gold and nuggets within the conversation but it's quite difficult
to access them, it didn't flow very well and I think it's a really interesting, I think
shining a light on what actually happened and maybe what the backstory was could give
a lot of help to people to make sense of it, what are the differences in perspectives
between John and Jordan, what was really going on and I'm going to sort of just do
a quick little bit of framing first, Paul, before we get into kind of your reaction
to it and what we made of it when we first saw it but if people are not familiar with
John's work, maybe they're very familiar with Jordan but not so familiar with John, so John
Viveke is worked alongside Jordan in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, they
both have deep interests in kind of the area of myth, religion, the deep story of western
culture, John had this series Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, 50 episodes that he brought
out probably in the wake of Jordan's kind of appearance on the stage as a kind of, he
probably prompted a little bit by that and John has had a huge amount of really interesting
conversations over the last couple of years with people yourself, Jonathan Pageau, many
of the people in the same kind of orbit around these sort of central questions of meaning,
questions of meaning, questions of the deep stories that drive us, all of the same topics
that Jordan is really interested in. I was fascinated by the clickbait title that Jordan
chose for the video, a conversation so intense it might be psychedelic, which is interesting
as well. This feels like a really significant coming together of perspectives that we've
been waiting and wanting to see. I'd like to start by saying they had a real enthusiasm
for each other and a real, I'm going to play a little clip now that came up at the end
like the real enthusiasm and warmth between the two of them.
Being a great proponent of yours, I mean that in the sense of noting the greatness that's
in you and seeing how it's manifested itself, especially in your relationship with your
students and noticing that and having admiration and respect for that.
And I respect your work and I disagree with it in parts, but we've always been able to
do that in a way that is born with affection and respect.
Well, God, it's always nice to find someone who disagrees with your work, who could help
correct it. Exactly.
You can say, God, man, that's why I want to talk to you. I don't like being wrong, and
I know you don't, and so no doubt we're still both pretty wrong.
Mostly so. If the history of science is something we should pay attention to, which we should.
Yes, or the history of our own life for that matter.
And I know, Paul, you've put out a couple of reaction videos to this and you've sort
of been wrestling a little bit with what happened. Maybe you could start by framing
what you were hoping for from the conversation and what your reaction has been to it so far.
I too was very much looking forward to this conversation. I know, I know John's work fairly
well, at least in these areas. And I know he's got some critiques of Jordan's approach
to meaning through narrative, through hero mythology. And I was really anticipating those
to working through some of those kinds of issues and they never got there. I, my reaction
like many other peoples was, what was that? I had never heard Jordan like that before.
I was amazed at how well John Vervakey sort of rolled with all of the redirections that
happened in the conversation.
You fundamentally understand God by saying what God is not, but not, of course, randomly,
right? What you're trying to do is.
Oh, that's sort of like the God of the gaps.
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's don't apologize. We're
friends talking.
Well, I don't, I don't want to derail the conversation.
So it's been, it's been like this and it's been wonderful. It feels to me like doing
poetry behind that conversation, especially on Jordan's side. I think part of it is he,
you know, he and John Vervakey last spoke in 2015. John Vervakey has continued his academic
trajectory. And I think with his YouTube channel and all of these conversations with him sort
of discovered a whole new pathway where Jordan has been busy with his health, the culture
war stuff. So I saw, I'm, I'm seeing this much more as a video where Jordan is to a degree
getting introduced for the first time with what John has been doing for the last five
years.
Yeah. And that was my sense as well, was that John was, John is so enthusiastic anyway. Like
he's, he brought that enthusiasm to the conversation and Jordan, I think, got him, got kind of
swept up in that to some degree as well. And it was kind of John reporting back to Jordan,
like, look what you've been missing or look what's been going on. Look at all this interesting
stuff that's been happening. But I want to start by pointing to like the central paradox
of the conversation is that John's central interest is in Deologos, which is kind of
a shared dialogue that goes somewhere new. And he kind of summarized it in there with
talking about Philea Sophia versus Philea Nicaea. Philea Nicaea meaning the love of
victory. Philea Sophia meaning the love of knowledge.
We haven't talked about why people want us to talk. And the reason they want us to talk
is because our ideas dovetail to a substantial degree and also diverge interestingly. And
so I guess they want us to talk so that we can think.
Well, that's it. And I see that's what I was going to say. That's one of the defining. I would
say one of the defining. It certainly seems to be the case as a defining criteria for Socrates,
that if you and I can get to places in the Deologos that we couldn't get to individually,
then real Deologos has has come into existence. And that's Philea Sophia, the love of wisdom,
as opposed to Philea Nicaea, the love of victory. And so right, right, right. I didn't know those
phrases. Philea Sophia, which is the Philea Sophia, the wisdom is the feminine essence of God.
Yeah, well, the Philea is, you know, it's itself a collaborative love.
Did you say Philea? Yeah, Philea and Philea Sophia. So Philea Sophia.
The three loves the Aros Philea Agape. This is Philea. And Philea is the love that is done
is expressed and shared in community. And then Sophia, of course, is the
word for wisdom. That's where we get philosophy from. Philea Nicaea is the love of victory,
like Nike victory. Right. And yeah, it's interesting because the it's tell me what you think of this.
I think the YouTube dialogues that we undertake are characterized by Philea Sophia and the
YouTube dialogues conducted in the main by the what would you call it legacy media are Philea
Nicaea. And I think people appreciate Philea Sophia much better. You better believe it.
I certainly appreciate it much better. For John, this is and he studied a lot as a cognitive
scientist. It's how can you have a conversation that goes somewhere new that builds upon itself,
that is not about trying to best the other person or just kind of repeat what you already know.
But how can you have a dialogue where you discover new territory together?
And I think the interesting thing for me is given that that was the subject of their talk,
the question is how much they achieve that in that conversation.
And I mean, if you go by the YouTube comments, you probably say that they didn't achieve it very
much. And it goes to the heart, I think of what I consider like the trajectory of Jordan Peterson
over the last since his kind of eruption onto the stage, the whole Peterson phenomenon of
kind of 2018 onwards, that sense of novelty and whether like my overall sense of him getting
slightly stuck in his story, which I'll come to a little bit in a bit. But there was this
weird, almost performative contradiction, given the topic that that John has made this kind of
lifetime study of, of what does it mean to get into a flow state together? What does it mean to
explore new territory together? What does it mean to actually know the cognitive science of what
is going on physiologically when we're in this kind of flow state of exploration?
And I like my overall sense is that I would love to see and this is not judgmental because Jordan
is obviously coming back from a huge number of difficulties, the health problems, and it's kind
of certainly not up to full strength. But to the hope is that in time, we might see Jordan enter
more into those kinds of conversations. But I felt that it was there were elements, there were
moments of that in this conversation with John, but it was very glitchy. Like there wasn't so much
of a sense of a shared edifice that they were both building together. There was a sort of,
I think there were moments of that, but but it also just felt, I think glitchy is probably the
best word that I can think of. I agree. In some ways, I contrast this with Jordan's first talk
with Sam Harris with Brett Weinstein there. In that first talk in Vancouver, Jordan was very
clearly trying to build something and Sam wasn't playing. Sam sort of played this knock it down
game and Jordan kept trying to construct something. Sam kept trying to knock things down. In this
conversation, I don't think Jordan was trying to knock things down. I think, I think he was,
I hear in many places in the video, he's trying to grasp, to assimilate, to figure out where John
is at. And so he's doing a lot of attempts at recognition, attempts at connection. But you
know, usually what you get with that hopefully is a weaving together of things. Whereas there,
it was sort of two tracks. John would mention something and Jordan would connect it with
something and John would go a little further and Jordan would connect it to something else.
John was very gracious in sort of developing that connection a little bit, but then
John continued to want to get back to something a little bit more consistent. And I think actually
through the video, John was able to make some impact, at least in terms of John's, you know,
four Ps of knowledge expanding beyond the propositional into the perspectival participatory.
And, and I think that was, that was helpful. And at the end of the video, I think they achieved
some of that. Yeah, and I'd love to, to maybe go into with you sort of sifting some of those,
those flecks of gold from the interview in a second. Those thought I'd like my overall sense
about this sense of Deologos, this sense of going somewhere new in a conversation. I'd like to just
sort of drill into that because my sense of what when I first discovered Jordan Peterson is like
2017, watching his lectures was there was this real sense of exploration, like he was, he was
going on a journey, you could sort of see him in the maps of meaning series in 2017. It was not a
dialogue, but it kind of was you saw him, he'd find one of his students who was listening and he'd
speak to them, and he'd respond to kind of the mood in the room. And you got this sense of there
was a lot and aliveness to his exploration was like he was walking in a landscape and putting
things together and he was walking. And I think that was part of what was really compelling about
him in that sense. And then I think when he first came to attention in 2018, he had a series of
conversations with people that also felt like they had that kind of sense of exploration.
And then we saw him go on this book tour where he was pretty much
with differences like not every evening was the same, but he was doing the same story pretty
much every night. And my sense is that over time he got more and more trapped in that story,
that he wasn't really on that sense of exploration or on that sense of kind of novelty anymore.
And I think that I mean people that I know who knew him at the time also said they found him
sort of he got a little bit more stuck and a little bit more reactive. And one of the amazing
things that I think a lot of us really respect about him is he also reflected on that himself.
I remember a question that he answered in an AMA a while ago that I'll probably play the clip from
here. He talked about the corruption of his soul that he recognized and the way that he was responding
to journalists, for example. The problem is I'm becoming too much on guard and I've noticed a
developing sense of impatience within me and some suspicion. And that's not good. I don't want to be
in situations where those are my fundamental orientations. It's a sign of a certain amount
of internal corruption on my part. And I want to be in situations where I'm speaking with people,
speaking honestly to people who are honestly listening.
And this is what I felt coming through quite a bit in the conversation with John. It came in and
came out this sense of John would say something that sparked a story that Jordan already knew
and he'd start kind of telling that story. And I've seen that quite a lot in some of his
interviews since he's come back. And it reminds me as a journalist when I whenever I interview
someone usually quite prominent who's been interviewed a lot in the past, you know that
if you ask them certain questions, they're going to give you a story. And it's almost impossible
to get them out of that once they start. The more the more famous someone is the more used to they
are to telling that story. It's like, okay, here comes the story about this. I won't name any names,
but it's happened quite a lot. And part of your job as a journalist like how can I get them out of
those tram tracks and into new territory. And sometimes it's very, very difficult because
anything you say, they'll just go into the story they already know. And I've had the sense sometimes
with Jordan in the conversations he had since he's got back, a guest will say something and then
it's like, okay, now it's the Cain and Abel story. Now it's the Tower of Abel story. And it's like,
as the audience, we've already heard all of those things. And there's something in that it's like
it's the when you go and see a band and it's like, well, play the hits you already know,
there's a little bit of that. But that was I felt that coming up quite a bit in the John
conversation that John would say something and then Jordan would kind of go into something
that we were already familiar with. And that's also how I having tracked the whole kind of
intellectual dark web conversation. That's where that kind of glitched out as well for me was this
sense of for various tribal reasons for various kind of aligned incentive reasons for various
that sense of exploration and novelty that I felt in 2018 2019 just fell away. Audience capture
being another issue, like all of these different things start to start to just and I think because
of the nature of the media environment we're in at the moment, it literally warps around you.
You don't you start to kind of tune out anyone who doesn't have a positive you've got an infinite
amount of feedback. So you only start listening to the supportive stuff, you start kind of just
producing stuff for the your traditional audience. Some things become profitable, admitting you're
wrong about certain things is not profitable. All of those kind of factors start to come in
as well. But that's why I think this is such a fascinating conversation to analyze because
the topic at hand, Deologos emergent alive dialogue is the thing I think
that we that we were attracted to originally. And I think it's also the thing that could
that that will that could potentially be Jordan's healing as well in some ways. Like I think that's
what he needs that sense of like pursuing truth in an original in an interesting in an in an
unscripted way again. I think that would that's the sort of the juice in some ways. The description
on the video I initially I was quite surprised the video was released at all because of the
strangeness of it. And I think that was known because of the strange psychedelic reference
in the title. My take on this increasingly is is more shamanic. And I think what you described is
is what Jordan needs in that something needs to disrupt his sense making. We need to see
in him a hunger again for something other than a lot of the political or social transformations
he's been talking about. And and I think you're right that the irony of the video is that this is
about Deologos and that is what we were looking for from it. And that is I think in many ways what
Jordan needs. Now I I'm fully aware that as a Christian minister using the word shamanic
will raise a lot of eyebrows among Christians. But as a as a as a working preacher and minister
that is exactly the way the Bible works in a preacher's soul. Because the Bible is a very
strange book and especially the teachings of Jesus they're supposed to disrupt. And if you
read the sermon on the mount after 2000 years nobody's really quite sure what that sermon means.
And in that sense it's rather shamanic in that it's supposed to break up our sense making.
So I think I think a number of us are looking for that for Jordan and from Jordan because
with you know what I often call his first wave I think that's what propelled him. When he came
onto the scene we heard something in that moment that broke up sort of the the stage sense making
and said oh here's some fresh insight. Now whether Jordan has that in him or not I've spoken to a
number of his undergraduate and graduate students who some of whom say things like
he your first your first impression your first for your first take for Jordan for a while is very
is very much that way. But then you once you've heard about you know the rats and the wolves
and then he sort of then okay this is all map territory and you move on. And so I agree very
much that I think if Jordan is going to really content to find to be able to make the kinds of
contribution we saw in 2017-2018 he's going to need different conversation partners and I don't
know that the current conversations he's doing which have many of which are sort of book interviews
but they're not really interviews. In other words he's I in some ways I see him trying to get at
Dia Logos and here John Vervakey actually has in a very you know serious way he's been studying it
and so I would love to see Jordan sort of come to John and say help me John you know find a new
way of having transformative conversations that not only transform me but transform even an audience
and and I think as Jonathan Peugeot said hopefully transform what is a fan base which
isn't particularly helpful but maybe a broader community where they can be where there can be
productive pushback and productive engagement that allows all of us to grow and you know that's
what I've seen in a lot of in a lot of your community and and the way that you've pursued
this work. Yeah and I'd like to play that clip from Jonathan Peugeot now. You're always aiming
at something that's better or you wouldn't be aiming you're always moving towards something
that's better or you wouldn't be moving so then why wouldn't you move towards the greatest good?
Yeah well it's because it's terrifying I suppose in part but then as you know I've tried to put
that into practice in my life and it's tearing me into pieces. Yeah I don't know though if
if one of the reasons is because you're also alone and I you know I because you I mean at
least to my understanding you're not in a in a in a community. Well it's hard to say I mean
it's hard to say. Because fans aren't a community. Well they've been a community I mean one of the
things that has held me together certainly is the commitment that I feel to to the people who've
been so positive towards me and my family. I mean it was very subtle but I got the sense in that
that Jonathan was questioning that the whole fan versus peer dynamic which I think we can all slip
into on this in this this the weird kind of nature of the business that we're in if we're
making content and particularly if we're sort of if that's a big part of our lives or a big part of
our business it's very difficult to yeah it's very difficult to avoid that dynamic especially
if in some ways you're kind of financially tied up with it as well. But I think this was yeah I
think that's what Jonathan I haven't checked that with Jonathan to be honest but that was what I made
of that interaction was was a sort of cautionary whoa careful fans are not people coming up to you
after a lecture people kind of in your comments threads they're not the same as as peers who
will challenge your thinking who will reflect back to you and will help you to kind of develop
and and that's what was also beautiful about the conversation with John is as Jordan reflected at
the end he was he's glad to have those relationships and and that's what's exciting potentially about
them continuing those conversations and continuing the the dialogue. I think part of what needs to
enter into into these into the space that we're we're sort of creating and exploring
is the question of institution because in a university context the university is supposed
to provide that in a church context the church is supposed to provide that what we're sort of doing
out here in YouTube land does not really provide that we might have some peer accountability
if I say something that I lose status in the eyes of David Fuller or Rebel Wisdom or John
Vervake or Jonathan Peugeot there might be a little bit of accountability in there but I think
asking deeper questions about structures and institutions would be helpful in
creating communities where that afford this over a long period of time and and I don't think any of
us quite know how to do that because I don't know that we've necessarily been able to create
structures that afford that very well. Can you explain what you think those might look like?
I don't know because again obviously as a as a working pastor churches have some of those dynamics
but all the same those same issues of audience capture are very true for clergy
because you get captured by your congregation they pay your salary and so then clergy then maybe
go to different places. I think what we've seen created I mean John Vervake will often talk about
this little corner of the internet where we're having conversations with you with Jonathan Peugeot
with each other we've got some of that going but we you know and I liked what Peugeot said to him
when he said you know fans are not a church okay well what what is this a church supposed to do
a church and this is actually my churches in the modernist frame have become these
little propaganda machines and I think that is there undoing right now because for many people
the last place you would go to have an open conversation about you what you really think
even if it's heterodox would be a church because you'll lose status for heterodoxy.
Heterodoxy in itself is not necessarily helpful and I think John's idea of Dia Logos where you've
got and where you've got two people seeking truth early in the conversation Jordan Peterson talked
about sort of hunting philosophia which I thought was good but that's more of what we need and
perhaps what we should think about more are hunting bands where you know people people
have practiced ways of collaboration they know each other's skills yet what motivates the hunt
for the tribe is the need for food and I think as you described what happens to people when they get
a very high status wealthy successful they're no longer on the hunt and there is a certain
you know Jordan's been back now since January it's not clear what he's doing but I fear a certain
lostness because he's had a couple successful books you know anybody will talk to him almost
anybody who he wants to will talk to him. Where's the hunt? Well the hunt is the internal drive
towards truth which I think was what really drew so many of us to him originally I would say
there is an open question you have to see what are the what are the confounding factors in that
I mean the whole idea of Peterson Inc nowadays I think is something that do you have the incentive
structure still to go for truth especially when certain things that you say get a certain audience
and it's very difficult not to not to kind of follow that even if that's completely unconscious
and then there's various things that you can easily dismiss people who are critical of you as
being bad faith or motivated by some other some other kind of oh they're just trying to get
views off my name or whatever that might be and then you start screening out people who might have
useful things to reflect back to you and you see that happen constantly in this in this landscape
and then you've got the comment sections you've got I mean I find that and I think also a little
bit of self-reflection and awareness of like that that happens to all of us probably to to to rebel
wisdom as much as anyone I can't deny that I'm I'm conscious of the comment section but at the
same time what I will say is there's a paradox of I don't think I think people have still been in
their minds this sort of like alternative versus mainstream what they don't realize is once you've
created a little thing around being alternative that becomes the status quo at that point so I'll
put out films that they'll be like ah that's too consensus or that's too status quo it's like
not for this ecosystem it isn't I know that when I put out certain things it's going to get a bad
reaction from from the comment section it's like what's more brave putting out anti-woke stuff that
I know is going to go down incredibly well in this little ecosystem that I'm part of or putting stuff
out that's going to challenge that perspective I mean I don't know I mean I'm I'm have to be aware
of my own biases as well like I know there's a lot of people like oh you you come from mainstream
media your BBC channel four or whatever and you're just still part of that it's like well
maybe I have some of that but also I think there's a lot of values that were held within the tradition
of journalism around truth seeking that maybe a lot of journalism has lost but I think the
alternative media has lost it never really had it and that's the the key point that I keep coming
back to it's like the incentive structures of the alternative are not conducive to truth seeking
at all yeah the the incentive structures of the mainstream are increasingly less conducive to
truth seeking as well but that's why we're in this really terrifying valley what I've called the uncanny
valley between the two and that's what kind of obsesses me and I'm fascinated by because we're
all like Jordan Peterson all of us are trying to pursue truth in our own kind of limited way
and sense made together and I think your that brings it back to what you were saying before of
like how do we do this because we've seen we can't really do this alone we've seen so many caution
retails of people being caught by their audience of being yeah basically falling by the wayside
the entire kind of history of the IDW is like one by one falling by the wayside and as an alternative
sense making structure like that's a terrible cautionary tale like these are very very smart
people and they all got captured in one way or another or most of them got captured in one way
or another or fell out or stopped kind of moving forward or whatever it whatever it is
but yeah that question of how do we do this and some kind of bands of hunters like you say I think
is the way to do it is to is to be in relationship with people who are able to challenge us and
we're able to kind of develop our kind of sharpener and knives against each other
part of the irony of the taking down of the mass media
culture has been that part of what afforded truth seeking and internal critique self critique
within that culture was it's it's well it's establishment it's it's sense of establishment
I was speaking with an accountant who was a neighbor of mine who used to work for newspapers
and he said you know in the 70s and 80s newspapers were enormously profitable and what that afforded
was the New York Times could have I mean in a sense they were so well established they could
have all kinds of self criticism built into it and I think as you well described a lot of
alternative media is so captured by audience they can't afford to waiver from their from
their dogma and now we're seeing that in the mass media as well because they're so hungry
they can't afford I thought that came quite through I thought that came through quite well
in Peterson's Barry Weiss interview and so actually with the decline of blue church
we're finding blue church increasingly acting like alternative let's say you know narrowly
you know narrow agenda organisms and so again I think there's there's both a
a kind of a a hunger driven a hunger for the truth driven that has to be willing to say
I don't I don't care how poor this makes me I'm that hungry but then probably also on the other
side where you have structures that say okay I can I can reasonably afford to pursue the truth
and I know it will cost me but I'm you know that is what we do and this kind of corruption I think
you find I certainly see it in church structures but now we're seeing it in as I think Jordan
Hall nicely says blue church structures as well it's a weird paradox that as the alternative
gets stronger the mainstream is becoming more alternative yes yes yeah I wonder
just whether we might go back to as we sort of taught as I mentioned sort of panning for gold
like the gold flecks in the in the conversation I mean I was really interested in what they were
talking about related to the they touched on post-modernism but only very briefly
John was talking about sort of Foucault and Derrida having a little bit more of a complex
it being a slightly more complex picture than is often painted of the of the post-modernists
and that felt that felt rich in itself that could have been a conversation if the mainstream of
western culture is the mainstream of human culture or akin to it so akin to that shamanic
tradition for example then the claim is that that mainstream is is the desire for power and
that's the opposite of what we're saying genuinely the opposite it's the antithesis to that because
that isn't isn't Philo Nikeia the antithesis to yeah I think it is um well I mean that's part of
is it is it genuinely the antithesis I mean so is this is this a claim of is this a claim of satanic
possession of the west I mean is the is the is the culture war that deep well I don't know I mean
the claim is that it's about fundamentals right it's a fundamental critique of western society it
means fundamental that's why Derrida went after philogo centric philogo centrism yeah and I think
and there's in Foucault it does similar things but the thing you have you would have to remember is
you know you toward the ends of Derrida's career right he's reaching into a neoplatonic mysticism
negative theology is something he starts to take an interest in and Foucault you know you know
technologies of the self and he gets very deeply interested in the work of Pierre Hadoe right and
what is ancient philosophy and the wisdom tradition and Philea Sophia and he starts to turn towards it
and starts to recognize it as I know nothing of that I know nothing of that yeah well that's what
so I mean well that's that's very interesting and and he dies yeah Foucault also or Foucault
no Derrida we were sorry we were speaking of Derrida I was speaking of both I said you see yes
getting very interested in negative theology neoplatonic mysticism and then you see Foucault
getting very interested in you know stoicism and and Pierre Hadoe's work there's an irony in
Peterson's work that I thought really came between the Michael Malice and the Barry Weiss
because on one hand Peterson has made a name for himself bashing post-modernity but
Peterson is himself post-modern in some deep ways and a regular critique of Peterson you had
James K Smith a professor from Calvin University on your program and he you know this is one of
his critiques of Peterson as well and I think I think the way forward for someone like Peterson
in what in what way uh Paul in what way is Jordan Peterson post-modern
modernity is dying and when and and John in that conversation nicely set up the contrast between
the three P's which are much more lived experience perspectival procedural and and so you've got the
one P which is propositional and modernity is all about the world of objects where where Peterson
when Peterson begins maps of meaning there are two ways to view the world a world of objects
and a form for action and so Peterson very much takes the pragmatists through modernity but within
that pragmatism there is what what John Revekey talks about those three P's and in this in this
beautiful section at a point that John Revekey makes all often he says what is emerging out of
cognitive science is a recognition that our ability to grasp something means sort of taking it into
ourselves we grasp the cup and in about minute 25 in there he goes through that we grasp the cup
in other words something of the cup has to get into my mind and so the subject object distinction
is being broken down by cognitive science and that is that is something within post-modernity
that they in fact have been working at because within post-modernity there's a critique of
that subject object we are we are um disinterested viewers from above who see the world as it is
and cognitive science is saying that's not how we know the world at all and and Peterson
with his sort of ancient modern approach has always sort of flexed in that direction and asked
questions that make rigid modernists like Sam Harris uncomfortable and so when you look at you
know Peterson drew such a strange breadth of fans some of them you know as as John Revekey said in
that interview people do not appreciate how radical Jonathan Peugeot is and he's so radical
because he's so ancient and that ancient modern has been attention in church circles now for the
last 20 years as modernity is receding and as there is a recognition that proposition as such
is always necessary it's deeply embedded in the scientific effort but is insufficient
for human beings to actually move forward and increasingly is an insufficient descriptor and
this deeply critiques Protestantism which is of course I'm a Protestant minister deeply critiques
the ways that we have framed communities so that has always been in Peterson and John is in some
ways pushing him on that and saying okay what does that mean as a scientist because Peterson is
always if you listen to Peterson and Barry Weiss they're lamenting the loss of blue church you
know whoa blue church has fallen and well that's Jordan's been pushing it yeah you can argue he's
probably one of the primary factors in the loss of faith that so many people had in blue church
meaning the sort of media establishment I think he he certainly and potentially quite deliberately
embarked on a on his mission to show up or or one of the one of the effects was to show up all of
the limitations of that structure yeah but I I think yeah I like that idea and I think you're
right that kind of the contrast and conflict between him and Sam Harris is very much Sam Harris
from from will barry in terms is orange modern completely modern rationality rules and in a way
Peterson probably is postmodern relative to that because he's but arguably he's also I mean he's not
you could argue he's metamodern I don't know if you know those distinctions so the idea in
integral theory is that you've got modernism science which is the structure then postmodernism
was effectively a kind of deconstructive force around that which is obviously something
Peterson's place himself against but in a way Peterson is postmodern in his critique of of
modernism but he's reconstituting it so in a way you probably would put him integral or
or um yeah integral or metamodern I mean there's different words for it but effectively
it's the word for a perspective that can observe and understand the other perspective that understands
what postmodernism is it understands what modernism is because within those worldviews they can't
actually understand the critiques they can't understand the the other worldviews whereas
the the the idea is that there's an integral worldview that can actually understand all of
these different perspectives and I'd say that's where I probably place Peterson within that
and but his critiques are are the same as um yeah his critiques of science
scientism and materialism are very similar to a lot of the postmodern critiques that's a
interesting and and I I just and Peterson partly gets there because of his Darwinian truth
and and that's I mean when he showed up in the in the christian sphere
I mean he basically uses Darwin to give an an account for the credibility of let's call it
ancient wisdom because if the wisdom has survived this long that is a tell for truth but modernity
arose in the frustration with the letdown of certain forms of ancient wisdom and you know
I don't know very much about you know I've I've listened to some of your content about integral
theory but I think with each passing there's always in the initial stages of passing there's
always throwing too much away and and then after sort of the um the tragedy of the revolution
those who are a little bit beyond it say all right well what of modernity should we keep
and what of modernity was unhelpful and and that's successive over all of the various patterns that
went before and and Peterson I think part of what he has shown is he is he has that capacity
but and and again to come back to Dia Logos the I think the questions are
what kinds of conversation partners what kinds of needs are going to help him to
fulfill that potential that I think that potential is I think what a lot of us saw in him and say
there's real potential there for breakthroughs beyond some of the siloed structures and and
again it's someone in the church a tremendous weakness of the church has been its siloed nature
it it either has borders that are too thin where it's always just me to me to me to behind any
new you know progressive cause or it's so rigid that you know we're just going to try to outlast
the world but that isn't working so and and Peterson showed I think potential for
affording some breakthroughs with a lot of these boundary issues
hmm yeah this feels very yeah very narratively right to kind of finish maybe on this on this
point and I agree that the idea that who are the dialogue partners that he maybe needs to engage in
to to to recapture that sense of exploration I think John is definitely one and I think pretty
much all the people who John has been in dialogue with over the last two years like all of those
there's some fascinating conversations with people like Bernardo Castro and Jonathan Pajot
and others exploring and and and getting into the stream of thought like jumping into the
stream of thought and swimming together this sort of sense of rather than coming from a fixed
position a sort of more malleable position where you're in dialogue with others and and evolving
your thinking I also would like if people are watching this and they're not familiar with
John Bovaki's work I wanted to reference some of the films that that I think would help kind of
frame him in a better way than than happen in that conversation maybe we put out a few interviews
with him one called flow states and wisdom another one after the meaning crisis which is where he
kind of frames his new Deologos project and another great dialogue between John and Peter Limburg
called the evolving conversation I want to put up the the title cards from those on
over the video and people can kind of find them in the show notes below and also maybe just just
touch on we we've been trying to kind of like how come I trained as a counselor but that's my
background and I trained in a form of Deologos called inquiry which is really in dialogue with
another person trying to trying to get to the edge of our understanding trying to articulate what's
going on in the relational field between us and to take ourselves somewhere new in that kind of
exploration and we've tried to do that as well with the courses that we're running as well with
John Bovaki is one of the guest faculty on our sense making 101 course I'd like to give a little
plug for that if you enjoyed the conversation with John or you want to learn more check out that
course because that's that's part of that's part of the answer for me is like I don't think we can
do this without becoming different kind as you said before without allowing ourselves to be
transformed and that's really what we've been trying to do like how can we do it's why we've
had such a focus on practice and such a focus on events and sessions that that try and work with
some of these technologies and I also point people point people towards other really amazing
technologies like circling like inquiry all of the empathy circles glass bead games some of these
other kind of technologies because I think and then that links back to what we were saying before
about john's 4p cognitive science the propositional is not enough the propositional is one aspect
but the procedural perspectival and the participatory is absolutely crucial and yeah I think that's
that's hopefully what we're all trying to kind of bring more in our own ways
well and and from I mean from the church side of things I mean churches have part of that
conversation that I thought was very interesting was when they when John was talking about grasping
the cup you have a sense that you can look at the light or you can see through the light and
they're both valid perspectives but there needs to be a transformation that occurs obviously
in Christian tradition you know we've got a lot of words for this this is conversion this is
quickening this is and and and you need to do that in order to know it isn't the question
as in a modern sense where you sit above it and you you look at all the pieces and you take an
analysis you actually have to step into it in order to know and and that sort of connects I think
the the knowing and loving because in you do not know unless you love and and in some ways you
cannot love unless you know at least something so I mean that at least for a Christian minister
that's always a part of of my work and and always the the question of continuing to reform
institutions always a pleasure Paul and I really like your new setup you're looking very professional
well thank you David I am I don't try too hard at that but uh I appreciate it awesome our ability
to make sense of the world is breaking down we're making more and more consequential choices
with worse and worse sense-making to inform those choices which is kind of
running increasingly fast through the woods increasingly blind over the last two years
rebel wisdom has interviewed some of the world's top thinkers now we've brought them together
for an eight-week online course sense-making 101 with Daniel Schmacktenberger,
Diane Musho Hamilton, John Vivecchi, Doshin Roshi and more improve your sense-making,
develop your sovereignty and join a wider community looking to do the same
