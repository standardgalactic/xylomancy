This will be a lecture looking at a whole lot of the themes we've been
considering all quarter in here, how they apply to a topic that is very close to
home. And what I already know from some of the emails today was Friday's lecture
looking at depression, was already getting close to home, some of the themes
that came out at the end of the chaos lecture, some of the notions there that
some of the stuff teaching us, perhaps there are no blueprints, perhaps there
need not be blueprints, perhaps there may still be blueprints despite a
theoretical demonstration that you don't need them hitting close to home also,
that is what all of today's lecture is about, looking at some biological
underpinnings of religiosity. And this one is far and away from the lecture I
am most nervous for, simply because this one people wind up having strong
opinions about, and I want to navigate through this one as successful as
possible. Okay, just to give me a sense of where I'm starting off from here,
how many of you would characterize yourself as religious, as fairly
religious, as highly religious? Okay, good. How many of you would characterize
yourself as very, very comfortably, exceptingly non-religious? Lots of
hands there as well. Okay, lots of potential differences in responding to
this. Where we pick up on is from where we left off with the lecture last
Wednesday, which was the Schizophrenia lecture. And where we finished with was
this whole notion that by now we have to have dealt with every single one of
these topics, starting on the far right, what's the behavior look like, and
eventually getting to the far left, what are the evolutionary roots? And what
has always been the rationale for that is the second we're looking at anything
with genes, genetic influences, genetic hints, genetic whatever, we're asking
where these genes come from, where's the evolutionary sense, where's the
adaptive value for anything we're looking at, how the sociobiologists
interpret it, someone else. Yeah, question?
I should be and I don't think I understand the subject enough to know. Other
than something about religiosity is done in a social context and that's going
to become important here. And the difference is one that puzzles me a
great deal because it clearly transcends issues of just the social
community, but that seems to be a good defining point to start from. Okay, so
where we ended up there with was this puzzle. We finished at the end of
depression looking at evolutionary aspects and looking at there may be some
hidden benefits, that weird argument in one of the readings in your reader
creativity and aspects of manic depression going hand in hand, but we were
left with somewhat of a puzzle at the end of the Schizophrenia lecture. Why
might there have been selection for these genes? Because once again we start
off with a theme from the very beginning. Ooh, genes being selected for. Why
did the giraffe have long necks? Because this is a trait that's adaptive. In our
Darwinian terms, this is a trait that's associated with leaving more copies of
your genes in future generations. What is the adaptive value for genes for
Schizophrenia? Because we looked at the fact that in this contemporary form,
Schizophrenia is by definition a maladaptive trait. Schizophrenics leave
fewer copies of their genes than their unaffected siblings. It is a trait which
is formally maladaptive. What might be a hidden advantage lurking there? And
where we left at the very end of that was just a hint that in fact as far as
anyone can tell, there are no hidden advantages to Schizophrenia. There may
not be any adaptive advantage. What I left you with there was the notion
however that there might be another disease lurking around related to
Schizophrenia which does have an adaptive advantage. And to begin here, what we
have to go back to is one of the basic 9th grade biology concepts in science
there, which is the whole notion that some of the time a genetic trait which is
god-awful in one setting may have some advantages elsewhere. And we all learn
the exact same example back in 9th grade, sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia
which in one context when fully expressed is a hematological disaster.
Absolutely bad news, horrible. And in other settings can protect you against
malaria and not by chance that versions of sickle cell anemia have evolved in
sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean areas, Thalassemia related diseases that this
has been a frequent solution. Also in passing showing us one of the truisms
from this class, there's no such thing as a bad gene. There's only a bad gene
environment interaction. Okay, so this theme in medical genetics comes through a
lot of times. Genetic traits which in one setting are bad news may have
advantages in another setting. And it's turning out this is a theme in lots of
different realms of genetics. Other examples, Tasex disease. Tasex, horrible
congenital disorder, predominantly found in Ashkenazi Jews. What you wind up
getting there is full-blown version, complete cortical failure to develop and
child is massively retarded and birth dies shortly afterward. Partial version
of Tasex disease and you're resistant to tuberculosis. Nobody knows the
mechanism for it yet. People absolutely understand why the sickle cell trait
both sets you up for an anemia and protection from malaria. Nobody
understands it yet with Tasex, but this explains one of the phenomena back from
the Middle Ages, the European belief that Jews were safe from tuberculosis
because they were poisoning the Christian wells. And that was a cause of a
large number of programs back when there is a genetic explanation, which is the
trait for Tasex disease in this partially expressed form protects from
tuberculosis. More examples of this. Cystic fibrosis, the most common congenital
disorder these days that is massively life-threatening.
A code. Anybody know a code?
By Wednesday. Do you have no where the handout is?
Are they sitting there though? Cystic fibrosis, full-blown version disastrous
disease. What you get in cystic fibrosis is inflammatory disease, your lungs fill
up with fluid, you often are dead by age 20, horrible disease, partial version
of cystic fibrosis, and you are protected against cholera. And the exact same
mechanism that causes an imbalance of fluids in the lungs is the same
mechanism that keeps you from losing all your fluids when you have cholera of
dehydrating, highly adaptive. A theme that keeps popping up over and over.
Full-blown version, bad news, partial genetic version, good news, and what you
wind up getting is this basic argument, a numerical argument very similar to the
I'll lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins deal of if you've got
enough people with the partial protective adaptive version you can
afford the occasional cousin with the full-blown version. The trait overall will
still be passed on. Now what this sets us up for is thinking about whether
something like this is going on with schizophrenia. And the question to ask of
course is what is a mild genetic version of schizophrenia? And this one got
discovered in the 1970s. Back to that classic study we've heard about in a
couple of different lectures by now, Kedi, that psychiatrist from Harvard, who
with his colleagues went off to Denmark and spent a decade there looking at
every single adoption case and looking at the patterns of schizophrenia, the
schizophrenic, the adoptive parents, the biological parents, in the course of
doing this they discovered something amazing. Because think about what these
guys did. This was this team of psychiatrists who spent a decade in
Denmark. What they did was interview every single family of every adoptee in
Denmark. This was like 10,000 people. This was a massive amount of work looking
for schizophrenics, looking in the various pedigrees, all that sort of thing,
interviewing huge numbers of people, just a handful of these folks so they
would all get the diagnostic criteria fairly similar, well-designed study,
blah blah, what had they done by the end of a decade? They had talked to more
family members of schizophrenics than any psychiatrists in history. And think
about this, your average psychiatrist who's got some schizophrenic patients
will, you know, meet once every six months with the parent if the schizophrenic is
on the young side, maybe occasionally will also have sessions on a regular basis.
These people had just interviewed tens of thousands of family members of
schizophrenics. And they noticed something interesting. They noticed that on the
average there was something a little bit strange about family members of
schizophrenics. Not all of them, and these traits are not only found amongst
family members of schizophrenics, but at a higher than expected rate there is a
weird sort of quirky personality that went with family members of schizophrenics,
biological family members. And this version of a much milder case of
schizophrenia is now called schizotypal personality. This is a
standardly recognized disorder in psychiatry. Schizotypalism is a mild
genetic version of schizophrenia. What does schizotypalism look like? First off,
people have somewhat loose associations, not remotely in the realm of a
schizophrenic, and there are standardized scales that can be given to show this is
somewhat out of the normal range, but not in the schizophrenic range in an
intermediate range. In addition, you get a social withdrawal, and this is not the
complete dysfunctional, unable to hold down a job locked up in the back of the
village version of schizophrenia. This is someone instead who just gravitates
towards fairly solitary occupations. This is the lighthouse keeper. This is the
fire tower watcher. This is the classic schizotypal occupation. This is the
person sitting alone in the projection room in the movie theater eight hours a
night in the dark. They're classic sort of schizotypal jobs, socially detached,
very solitary. The most striking feature of schizotypals is what is termed
metamagical thinking, and this is where things begin to get interesting.
Metamagical thinking, this is not someone who is thought disordered,
psychotic, unable to function. This is someone who just kind of believes in
strange things. This is someone who's really, really into science fiction and
fantasy. This is someone, okay, I see some of the concern popping up here. This is
someone who's into some sort of new age stuff in a really frenzy sort of way.
This is someone who believes in mental telepathy or UFOs. This is a first hint.
This is someone who, if they have a religious structure or belief, has an
extremely concrete level of interpretation. Remembering this seems to be
quite similar to schizophrenia, what apples oranges have in common multi-syllabic
words, that concreteness at the level of abstraction. These are people who tend
towards extremely fundamentalist, concrete interpretations of religious events.
Seven-day creation of the world, this is not a metaphor, this is not a parable.
This could be measured down to the minute. People alive who were once dead, this is
not a metaphor for keeping the spirit going. This is an exact description of the
events. We begin to see where we're heading here. What schizotypillism is
about is it's a very mild version of schizophrenia in terms of the loose
associations, in terms of the concreteness of associations, the social
detachment, and most of all the metamagical thinking. This is now a
standard diagnostic category in psychiatry to have a schizotypal
personality. What we then ask is, where does this come from? What is this
like? What we have to ask is, of course, our usual question when trying to make
sense of a human trait is recognizing 99% of human history was not spent with
schizotypals being able to get jobs in film projection rooms. What does
schizotypillism look like in traditional non-westernized human societies?
The answer to that turns out to have been floating around for 60, 70 years in the
anthropology literature. This is back to the 1930s, an anthropologist named Paul
Raiden, who was the first one to point this out, was the first one of a whole
tradition emphasizing what was a pretty strong area of research in the 1940s
in anthropology. He was the first person who pointed out that in traditional
human societies, there is a category of people there who count as, and these are
his exact words, half crazy. Who are the half crazies in traditional human
society? The shamans, the witch doctors, the medicine men, the medicine women,
these are members of society who make a living being metamagical. And Raiden was
the first one to emphasize this. In traditional human societies, the shamans
are the ones who converse with the dead for ritualistic reasons. The shamans are
the ones who speak in tongues. The shamans are the ones who at the full moon
turn into the hyena to protect the village from predators. The shamans are
the ones who are metamagical for a living. And this has been a theme in
anthropology for quite some time. One anthropologist named Akternak referred
to shamans as being healed madmen. In the 1940s, anthropologists named Krober,
who started the Anthra Department in Berkeley and was one of the grand old
men in the field, this is a quote of his describing what shamanism is about.
The shaman displays his possession by a spirit by publicly reenacting his
specific personal experience, that of the man suffering from a particular mental
affliction. His projections, his hallucinations, his journey through space
and time, thus became a dramatic ritual and served as the prototype for all
future concepts of the religious road of perfection. And this was the
recognition in the 30s and 40s that what shamanism is about is a very controlled
and very socially contextual version of metamagical schizotypillism. The word
did not exist in the field at the time, but that is what it is. Now what
Krober emphasized in his writing was, these are not schizophrenics. And what
we heard about in that story in class four days ago, looking at that
schizophrenic person in that Masai village is that people in traditional
human societies are no more tolerant to the mentally ill than we are in the
West and just as delighted to find cultural means to peripheralize them,
these are not full blown schizophrenics. These are not people who suddenly are
speaking in tongues at the exact silent moment in the hunt. These are people
who are speaking in tongues at the right time. These are people who were
hearing voices at the right time. And you remember what the punchline was of
that story about that schizophrenic woman in that Masai village was she heard
voices at the wrong time. Hearing voices at the right time is not
schizophrenia. It is a version of schizotypillism. And what you see when
you look at the human tradition of shamanism, these are not peripheralized
people. These are some of the most powerful members of society. Many
societies have a tradition of shamans being celibate, but many of them, most
of them as it turns out, do not. And these are people who are anything but
reproductively maladaptive. These are people who have been passing on their
genes just fine throughout history. Shamanism, this mild version, this
contextually appropriate version of metamagicalism has done wonderfully
throughout human history. And a great example of that, the fact that you need
to get it just right, was Krober sort of emphasizing this, that in the right
setting, what would be an absolutely peripheralizing set of traits instead
makes you a very powerful, very sanctioned, and that's the word that he
used, a very sanctioned member of society. And it's not for nothing that the
word sanction has a whole lot to do with the word sanctuary. This is a realm in
which the exact same traits would spectacularly fail to work in other
cultural settings, do it right, and it works just fine. And Krober had a
wonderful anecdote about this, this sense of you got to get it just right. He
apparently was at some ritual ceremony. He spent most of his time doing his
anthropology with Native American groups, and this was some ceremony being
done by the Winnebago's. And I was actually found it quite bizarre that
there was a group called the Winnebago, but hanging out with the Winnebago's,
and this was one of his informants there sort of explaining this ritual. And
this was apparently some really fraughty, really quite over-the-top ritual
that the shaman was pulling off and was speaking in tongues and rolling on the
fire and all of that. And this guy said, that is great. We've got this shaman
here. This guy is like the best. He's worth every dollar we pay him. This guy
is terrific. We are so lucky to have a shaman like this in our village. This
guy is, thank God we don't have two of them though. Two way too much. One's
just fine. And you have this recognition that this is not schizophrenia. You
wouldn't want a person to be schizophrenic because they will be as
peripheralized as in our own society. You want to get it just right. You don't
want to have too many of them. You've got to have some people who are some
plain meat and potatoes, good hunters, that sort of thing. And you want the
ratio of that to the shamanistic metamagical folks to be quite high, but
you need a few of them around. And what the anthropologists have been noting
for 60 years is all human cultures traditionally have some very metamagical
folks around. And these folks are anything but peripheralized with a
decreased reproductive success. They're some of the most honored members of
society. So if you wind up getting here is that classic, partially expressed
sort of continuum deal going on, which is human societies throughout history
have had such a need for shamans that they can put up with the occasional
second cousin who's fully schizophrenic. As long as you've got the ratio right.
And what the numbers suggest, the one to two percent rate of schizophrenia
throughout human cultures and the number average population size of human
villages and the number of shamans it works about right. Throughout history
there has been more of a predominance of schizotypal shamans than of
schizophrenics you can afford to put up with the occasional cousin. Now where
does this wind up heading? What the main point of this section is about is this
is not just about the people naked in the National Geographics with the bones
on their noses. And this was a critical transition recognizing this at some
point a whole lot of people and I feel we're writing about the primitiveness
of non-westernized religion. And there was a great quote who came up with this
one a guy named Devereux referred to primitive religion as being organized
schizophrenia. This was somebody in the 1940s exactly getting this flavor of
contextualized appropriate hearing the voices at the right time all of that.
But this was overwhelming literature about the weird stuff those folks are up
to in the night and the time life specials on public television and what
the critical transition is is it's not just about them. At some point this
anthropologist Ackernick who was quite leftist in his orientation wrote a
long essay saying how incredibly culturally chauvinistic it was of the
western anthropologist to write all these articles about how shamans or half
healed mad men and how condescending that was to talk about those cultures as
being so irrationally based in contrast to us and what's the obvious punch line
is the problem isn't saying that they're irrational when we're saying that we
aren't but it's saying that we're equally irrational. We're equally
irrational in some of the tenants that we have here. A quote from Ackernick at
the time was our culture is unique and outlawing the irrational. Let me give
you some recent statistics from a survey. What's the name of the survey the
main national survey people who yes Gallipol that guy the Gallipol a recent
Gallipol survey I know about you guys but these numbers astonished me 25% of
Americans say they believe in ghosts 36% believe in mental telepathy 47% believe
in UFOs and more than 50% of Americans believe in the devil and a belief that
the devil influences daily activities. These are people who can vote. These are
people who can serve on juries. These are people who can operate motor vehicles.
These are people making decisions about medical interventions. I for one in this
outpost of not terribly extreme irrationality in this corner of the
country. I'm astonished. We live in a world that is highly irrational and the
punchline of this is this is not simply about non Western traditional human
societies. The exact same threat of schizotypillism runs throughout all of
the belief systems of human societies including Western ones. We are permeated
by irrationality. Now some of the versions of it that we have in the West
are utter nonsense ones ones that have just been like invented out of thin air
in recent years which is kind of like fast food for the sort of new vote sort
of medieval peasants in their hot tubs up in Marin. This is the world of
crystals and channeling and things of that sort but some of the versions of
our Westernized irrationally go back millennia and organize some of our most
cherished values the same irrationality and the same valuing of those who
invent the appropriate versions of the irrationality runs throughout the West.
Okay just to show you that I'm not being overly hostile or will try to pull in my
own sort of tradition that I was raised in is not normally considered a sign of
robust mental health to hear voices coming out of burning bushes. This is
considered a worrisome sign. This is considered diagnostic. It is not a good
thing to be reporting that you just spent the night wrestling an angel. It is
usually a very disturbing sign if you were reporting you've had a conversation
with someone who is dead and has risen from the grave. These are diagnosable
problems in our secular Western realm. These are the backbones of our belief
systems we in the West as well as we humans in non-westernized settings.
Schizotypillism runs through all of human history. What you wind up having then
is this obvious question. Who invented this stuff? Who came up with the notion
that the world was invented in seven days or snakes with apples are up to
something no good or it's possible to give birth and you're still a virgin.
These were not designed by committees. These were designed by extremely
formative, extremely influential schizotypals throughout history. Yes.
Yep. It's genetic evidence. Those same studies showed that it runs through the
adoption studies showed as a biological trait. It runs through the biological
side of the adoptive pedigrees. It's a genetic trait. What the new studies
are now being in the show is mild tendency towards increased dopamine
tone, mild tendency towards most of the biology we heard about. What we're
seeing is totally artificial bucket to say schizophrenia up to here past the
side non-schizophrenic. We have this in-between zone like everything else
we've been thinking about. It's on a continuum and seems to be the same
biology in a much milder form. Question somewhere there?
Yep. Same sort of stuff. Okay. So what do you wind up? Yeah. Question?
Yep.
And you said that all of them agreed that they heard voices in French time. So were you saying that their entire tribe was schizotypal?
No. Because the critical thing there is they will very readily tell you much as
people will tell you here in their own schizotypal experiences that you need
the right person to lead it. They can't get that going without the right shaman
starting it off. You need them as a catalyst. Yeah.
Okay. Why do we need this? Why do we value this? Okay. We'll come to this probably in about two days, but this is
tapping into all of the, you know, why do we search for some fairly
unlikely answers to the big questions that plague all of us? We'll come to this
in two days. But, you know, this is getting at the core of some of the basic
questions here. Okay. Let me push on here. What you wind up seeing with this is
that this is on a continuum. And who invented this stuff? And you look
throughout the history of religious leaders, those who have invented some of
the theology, and we will come to different variants of religious leaders
shortly, as you see those who invented the theology that there is very often a
thread of metamagical thinking that goes through this. And this is metamagical
thinking of a type that falls readily into the spectrum of schizotypalism.
Now, one of the themes we've endlessly come back to in this class is appropriate
context, appropriate context. And this is a perfect realm to see this, because what
we wind up getting is you got to get it just right. If you hear voices, it's got
to be during the ceremony. If you're speaking in tongues, it can't be in the
middle of the silent part of the hunt. You don't want to have too many of them.
Thank God we've got this shaman, but not two of them around here. You've got to get
the context right. And what we've seen throughout human history and Western
history as well is get it wrong, and we have names for these things. Get it wrong,
and these are a board of religious fringe groups. These are cults, and you look
at some versions of this in our own recent time. You look at David Koresh and
Waco. You look at someone like James Jim Jones in Jonestown. You look at someone
like Charles Manson, and these are people who were highly metamagical in
their thinking, highly charismatic, but hit a wall at the point where we still
classify them as cults. Manson is a diagnosed schizophrenic. With the other
two, there's only post hoc sort of forensic psychiatry that you can do. What
you wind up getting is get it wrong, and we call it a cult. Get it right in the
right time in the right place, and maybe for the next couple of millennia, people
won't have to go to work on your birthday if you get it exactly right in
that setting. So what I think we see here is a setting here for making sense, the
exact same traits in a different context to use Krober's words in a cultural
context that is not sanctioned. The exact same traits count as
psychiatrically suspect these days. What this is about is not only if you get it
in the right context, is it okay? It is highly honored, tapping into the question
that came in before, that all human societies have a strong need for a
certain degree of these folks around. You need to get the ratios right. Okay.
Picking up on this theme, a transition to a next point. In the sense that this is
talking about sort of the structural steel of religious belief. What are the
basic beliefs you have? There is no God but one. He is Allah. You know, whatever
versions of the central formats you have, there is a trinity. I am who I am. Any of
these variants, these are sort of the building blocks, the structural steel of
religion. But what religion is often also about is lots of other things. We have a
very modern, very westernized view of religion these days. What religion is
often about is the social community that it brings you. What religion is often
about is the motivation for good works. Throughout most of history, what religion
is about in one very orthodox variant is the carrying out of rituals. The daily
performance of ritualistic behaviors in the context of religion. And this
transitions us to the next subject in here. And this whole notion of ritualism as
a backbone of religion. Wonderful quote to that effect. Henry Ward Beecher,
father of Harriet Beecher Stowe, famous Protestant preacher in New England, I
think the 1830s or so, had this quote at the time. Religion is daily bread.
Religion is not just cake on Sunday. The notion that what religion is about is
the small acts. God is in the detail. Religion is in the small acts of the
daily rituals. Now beginning to look, not at the large theological notions, our
religion believes there are multiple gods, there are virgin births that God
can speak through a burning bush, but instead religion as the daily practices
of ritual. Now what is interesting about this? What comes through with this is
another theme, another subtype of a very mild version of a psychiatric disorder,
which once again works spectacularly when you get it just right. Not now with
the metamagical big theology building blocks of religion, but the daily bits
and pieces of ritualism. And this brings in another psychiatric disorder, one we
haven't talked about much in class so far. Okay, I guarantee on a regular basis
all of us in this room getting to some point where it's some anxious period,
you've got some major deadline, you're applying for some summer, something
rather that you really want to get, you're totally uptight about it, you're
sitting down and you're writing the essay and before you can write the essay,
you've got to get your favorite pen that's got to be right there and you got
to rearrange your desk and you got to get everything sorted out and finally you
finish it and you go mail off the application, you know, you put it in the
mailbox and you check again to make sure it went down and this is really
important, you don't want to see it check again, just to make sure and you're all
set for that and you finally, there's no one else around until you go and you look
in front of it and looking back at it and that sort of thing. I mean we all do
this, actually maybe we all do this and I'm embarrassing myself horribly, but my
bet is most of us do this sort of thing. We fall into obsessive little rituals
during times of anxiety. We also have rituals, intrusive thoughts that just
invade our heads at times where they are of no obvious purpose, they are at the
cost of thinking anything more clearly, it's totally maddening and you can't stop
the thoughts. For example, today I'm working on a paper that's involving all
sorts of very deep room of thought and figuring out all sorts of data stuff and
I've made no progress on it at all this morning because for some reason that I
don't understand at all, all of today I've had the damn theme song from
teletubbies going through my head and I can't stop it, especially the part where
Lala leaps up and says, Lala the really cute part there and I can't stop doing
this and I don't know what's going on, I did not plan to lose today's
productivity because of teletubbies, but we get this some stupid jingle that's
stuck in your head, you find yourself going up a flight of stairs and you
can't stop yourself from counting the steps, we do this, we all do this and we
tend to do it more often during periods of anxiety and the interpretation of that
is that we impose this totally arbitrary useless destructive structure at a time
when everything else feels like you're walking on quicksand, we all do this as
some sort of adaptation to periods of anxiety and what we transition into now
is talking about a psychiatric disorder where people do this all the time and it
not only gets in the way of them getting some work done on a project that
requires some concentration, this is a disorder that absolutely destroys their
lives. This is OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder and the full-blown version of it
bears so little resemblance to what any of us do when we are having to get the
pen right and checking the mailbox the third time and having the jingle go
through your head for a while, it is of such a scale larger, it is so much more
destructive, it is virtually unimaginable from our perspective. People with OCD have
their lives completely destroyed by this disorder. People with OCD in the full-blown
version spent six hours a day washing their hands. The characteristic that's
always at the top of the list with OCD is the obsessive focusing on hygiene, is
worry that you are constantly in some way soiled six hours a day of washing.
These are people who cannot hold down jobs, their marriages come apart, their
relationships are destroyed because they cannot stop washing and you have in the
reader one profile of somebody with OCD from a book entitled the boy who
couldn't stop washing, this is the symptom that always pops up at the top of
the list and the actual washing process is ritualistic beyond belief. These are
people who have bought seven different kinds of antibacterial soap, they go
through this whole sequence, the water has to be a certain temperature for the
first level of washing, then a certain type of towel that they dry themselves
off with, that towel has to be put out of the room because it's dirty then, then
the next layer of washing with the next soap, go through two hours of this,
they're finally done, turn to leave to go to their job, go to their whatever and
on the way out brush their elbow against the door and they have to start all
over again and you will stop them at that point and say you will miss this
interview, you will not get this job and they will say yes I know but I'm not
going to be able to function and I'm just, it's dirty, I know my elbow, I know
I'm going to touch it then and then I'll get in my face and I just have to start
over, I'm not going to be able to get anything done today anyway so I need to
go wash, if I don't wash I'm not going to be able to and back they go and hours
and hours of this, people with OCD spend half their waking hours doing this,
people with OCD just have constant sequences of numbers going in their
heads, constant jingles, intrusive thoughts, they cannot stop thinking what
if I don't stop the car at the next stop sign, what if I run down this person,
they have the intrusive thoughts of I'm absolutely sure I struck somebody at
that street crossing back there, I've got to go back and check, okay, they don't
see anybody there, they drive on five miles down the road, probably the person
flew off into the bushes, I have to go back and check, I have to go back and
check, they can never leave their home because they've left the door unlocked,
they go back, they check the door is locked, they have to go back, they left
the gas on, they left the light on, this is absolutely paralyzing, intrusive
thoughts, what if I leaned over and struck the person next to me, what if
somebody kills my loved ones, you can't stop the thoughts, they just keep coming
at these people, they cannot enter or leave a place, there is a paralysis about
entering and leaving built around this sort of almost magical exclusionary
power that you get a transition into a place, they cannot enter a room until
they do a prime number of tapings on the wall before entering, they can then not
enter the room until if that's prime number and then a different prime
number with their left foot shaking, completely arbitrary symptoms of having
to enter and leave, numerology, these people cannot begin a meal until the
utensils are absolutely symmetrical or lined up and they're never perfectly
symmetrical and the entering and leaving ritual is never done right and they
certainly can't enter the classroom unless the number of steps from here to
the door is two times an interval that's with this a very mathematical quality
to it and it's never quite right and you've got to do it all over again and
what's been pointed out one of the really interesting sort of insights as to
what OCD is about is that this is an anxiety disorder, this is a pathological
attempt to impose structure, to impose predictability, to impose control in a
world where everything is pathologically provoking of a sense of
dis-ease and uncertainty and anxiety and the absolute horrifying version of OCD
that I've heard described is this metaphor where this is straight out of
ethology and this is a fixed action pattern, we all know the fixed action
pattern of a dog is settling down at night on its blanket and what does the
dog do? It circles a few times before it settles down but then it circles a
couple of more times and just as it's rated it and then it circles a few more
and you can see at some point the dog doesn't even want to do this
anymore and it takes a while longer in another 30 seconds before the dog can
finally escape from this fixed action pattern and sit down. In OCD the person
never ever escapes, the person spends forever circling on the blanket being
unable to finally lie down and rest because they are just consumed with
these rituals with these obsessive intrusive thoughts and what you get is
this is completely paralyzing. Okay here's an example of an obsessive belief
that we all have. Okay can anybody identify this? Okay here's what it is
this is an aerial view in fact it's a satellite photograph of here this is a
tray of rice crispy treats and you've just walked into the room and it looks
like this and for a huge percentage of us within a minute or so it's going to
look like this because we all feel this compulsive need to take a knife and
cut off that edge. Okay let me just canvas you on all of that. Okay how many
of you okay how many of you do this for starters? I certainly do. Okay how many
of you of those who do this cut off this bit here because it doesn't really
count on your diet. Okay a couple of hands how many of you cut it off because
what's perfectly obvious is going from this to this decreases the total
perimeter so that it will stay fresher that way. Okay problems that how many of
you wind up doing it because it's just getting at you that it's the knife's
just there and you just have to cut it off and smooth out the edge. Yes that's
why we all do it and then what you then decide is that there's this little bump
here which requires you to trim this out and then there's the little bump and off
you go with that and we all wind up doing that but if this is what you did
around the clock for your entire life it would destroy it and what is most
striking with people with OCD is you could never go through the sequence I
just did there's no insight. The person does not sit there and say help there's
something wrong with me I feel this need to wash my hands six hours a day they
say help there's something wrong with me I can never get clean I'm just so dirty
everything I do makes me dirty there's no insight into it. Okay so where does this
fit in again our modern version of religion our modern very secularly
influenced version of religion so often involves an emphasis on what
religion is about is counseling the trouble what religion is about is
holding the hands of the newlyweds and making sure they understand what
they're getting into what religion is about is comforting the disbelief what
religion is about is the good works but this is not what religion has often
been about throughout history often the religious leaders are not necessarily
the ones who are most psychotherapeutically minded or the most
galvanizing of people into the good works often religious leaders have been
the ones at the head of a crusade often religious leaders have been the ones
with the most vivid images of what hell and damnation would be like but often
what religious leaders have been are the people who are best at doing the
rituals and that has been another thread of religious practice throughout
history of religious leaders as often being among the most fervent the most
accomplished at carrying out of rituals now let me give you a sense of this
because as I began to read more in this this absolutely astonished me because
I knew very little about the stuff just the scale of this and starting off with
what will probably be a fairly alien religion for most of you in here and
then moving into examples closer to home looking at orthodox very traditional
Hinduism looking at the behaviors of a Brahman an individual who devotes their
entire life to ritualistic practice in pursuit of their religion a Brahman a
highly observant Brahman spends six hours a day in cleansing rituals and
there are detailed rules as to which hand you wash in what sequence how many
times you wash each hand separately how many each one together the sequence
with which you wash out one side of your mouth versus the other with water
there are set rules for Brahmins as to how you were supposed to lie down at
night dictating what your first sight is in the morning there are set rules as
to what direction you must face when defecating in terms of what you were
looking at at the time there are set rules for rituals you have to do when
entering a temple when leaving a temple there are set rules for how many
breaths you take through each nostril you close one nostril during your prayers
for a certain number of breaths then you close the other and all of these are
very carefully stipulated the number of mouthfuls of food the number of times
you chew per mouthful the number of prayers you have to say per day
sequences of magic numbers all of this is absolutely spelled out and orthodox
Brahmins consumed their entire days doing this okay next example orthodox
Judaism spectacularly yeah question great okay hang on for a while we will
come to that that's a superb question as to why they seem to have lots to do with
cleansing and food preparation wow thank you okay do you want to why don't we
take a five-minute break right now and you can all store in the frontier for
handouts
lots of opinions here lots of thoughts once again that same thing I mentioned
two days ago three days ago whenever this is very provocative stuff take
advantage of the course website put up some of your opinions get dial-ons going
on this because people lots of times have extremely strong opinions on this and
very interesting ones take advantage of this couple of questions that just came
up how come people with OCD don't come down with learned helplessness why aren't
they depressed because part of the fuel behind OCD is you're always convinced
aha one more now I know instead of doing it 17 times 18 if I do it 18 then it's
going to be perfect you've always just figured out not only do I have to do the
six hours of washing but make sure I never step on a crack and then I won't
break my mother's back you're always figuring out the next step then pointing
out we're about to go in a direction where what are the advantages of a mild
version of OCD and we're discussing this in a religious context I should point
out in a secular context there's a tremendous advantage to a mild version
of OCD what it does is get you into a place like Stanford what it does is work
to a tremendous advantage given how regimented and disciplined a lot of
folks are in here get it in the right context blah blah that theme that we
have again and again okay shifting over just seeing orthodox brahman belief and
Hinduism absolutely dominated virtually full-time with ritualistic behaviors
orthodox jewelry a spectacular number of laws built around food preparation the
kosher laws very detailed rules as to how long of a time interval between
eating one type of food and another type of food if you inadvertently mix up the
silverware with different types of food ritualistic cleansing rituals that you
have to go through involving putting the utensils in dirt for months on end and
special prayers that have to be said rules about how you enter and leave a
holy place involving certain prayers involving a certain rich ritualistic
touching that you have to make on the door jam there all sorts of magic
numbers than the number 18 has magical powers and orthodox Judaism and it's
built around numbers of times you have to say a prayer multiples of 18 you have
these prayer shawls that have strings on the end which have 18 knots in them and
they have to be pulled a certain number of times here's one of the amazing
examples of ritualism okay these numbers have magical powers and orthodox
Judaism and you will note 365 is the number of days in the year 248 is the
number of bones that people believed were in the bodies during the Middle Ages
when this evolved and together 613 according to the holy books there are
613 rules for daily behaviors 365 prohibitions every day 248 things that
have to be done every day the preponderance of the prohibitions leading
one clearly fairly depressive rabbi back when to be saying obviously it would
have been better if none of us were born given the fact that there were more
things that we could mess up by doing but what you see here is which is highly
ritualistic the number of prohibitions equaling number of days of the year the
number of ritual constraints the equaling the number of bones in the body
613 is the magic number okay where did these numbers come from very often in
religious rituals what you find is a number has symbolic value because it's
got a certain appeal for making learning easier it is not by chance that a base
10 society came up with 10 commandments because 10 commandments that are much
easier to remember than 9 or 11 what are these about you would say okay well
there's some sort of ritualistic content here God the number of things God
doesn't want us to do each day is equal to the number of days of the year the
number thing God wants us to do is equal to the number of bones in the body
okay great device for remembering the rules but here's the amazing thing
nobody knows the rules you look through thousands of pages of commentary
stretching back centuries and the rules aren't written down and various rabbis
have made a living arguing over what are the 365 things you aren't supposed to do
each day in other words the numbers are more important than the content the
content is less critical than the fact that whatever they are there's 365
things that God doesn't want you to do and whatever they are there's 248 that
God wants you to do the number that you are attributing to God is more
important in that case than the content okay classic classic obsessive
numerology switching over traditional orthodox Islam what you find there is
very detailed rules as to what foods you can eat what the first food is you're
supposed to eat each day there are rules as to how you enter and leave a holy
place there are rules for very ornate cleansing after release relieving
yourself very very detailed rules when you are washing out your mouth how many
mouthfuls of water which hands you wash in which sequence the exact same thing
exact same rules as with an OCD person after the showering the explicitly
written down when a man is washing himself at the end of the at the end of
the cleansing should he happen to touch his penis he has to do the whole
sequence all over again magic numbers thought to have powers there 7 10 70 and
100 apparently have magical powers in Islam and you have very explicit
concrete instructions about them Muhammad himself wrote down that a man
who says a prayer with clean teeth gets 70 times the brownie points as a man
saying his prayers without them multiples of magic numbers with all of
that and probably for most of you by now what will be the most familiar is
looking at orthodox Christianity and you have rosaries and the counting of
rosaries you have three as a magic number you have very detailed numbers
of times you are supposed to say prayers you have rules for entering and
leaving churches even in Christian groups that are viewed as some of the
least ritualistic some of the most cerebral in some ways you look at the
Lutherans Lutherans have set rules for prayers that are only said during even
years prayers that are only said during odd years all of these versions of
orthodoxy are absolutely shocked through with rituals built around cleansing of
the body food preparation entering and leaving of significant places and
numerology it's the exact same list as you find with OCD and Freud a hundred
years ago came up with this amazing quote to that regard Freud described
obsessive compulsive disorder OCD quote as an individual religiosity and
religion as a universal obsessional compulsion he absolutely linked the two
now just when you're thinking that I'm standing here and I'm started going to
start pathologizing religious belief from sort of a medical psychiatric
standpoint the exact same conclusion has been reached by religious leaders over
the centuries as well in the 15th century there was Saint Loyola no Saint
Ignatius of Loyola and what this guy did was he wrote this long track
describing scrupulosity scrupulosity is not a common word in English anymore
but it's opposite certainly is being unscrupulous being scrupulous having
scrupulous scrupulosity at the time was defined as someone who is going through
religious ritual for its own sake someone who was not thinking about the
content but was just doing the ritual and he wrote this long track to Catholic
priests saying watch out for people like these people who were coming and being
super devout but you will notice they're just doing the rituals without
thinking of the content your job is to recognize them and guide them back into
actually focusing on the content they shouldn't be doing the rituals for their
own sake there's a danger of people like that showing up in the Talmud and
Orthodox Judaism the exact same thing there is a lawn there that when you read
the holy book of Judaism the Torah you were not allowed to do it by heart you
have to actually read the words because there is an injunction to think about the
content don't do it in a rote way and Muhammad himself in Islam wrote down
that people who give prayers without thinking about the content the prayers
don't count even religious leaders for centuries for millennia have recognized
the pull of religious ritual for its own sake to have to admonish religious
adherents to pay attention to the content because the ritual takes on a
life of its own where the numbers the content the ritual is more important than
the actual thought behind it yeah
exactly and that was that point that transition talking about schizotypilism
there's much more resemblance to the large theological building blocks of
religion of spirituality what are our military's principles what do we believe
do we believe you always follow orders you never follow orders you don't agree
with what's more important value sort of stuff this is instead in the realm of
religious practice and this is the realm of very Orthodox religious practice
absolutely completely different realm so where am I heading with this obviously
emphasizing the similarity of the traits and that whole business that once again
have a six-hour compulsion to wash your hands each day and have it occur in the
secular context of OCD it destroys your life you cannot function in society you
are peripheralized you are mentally ill and that exact same theme get it right
in the right context and this is protected this is honored this is
rewarded get it in the right setting now nothing about being able to do
rituals and turn them from your own private OCD into the religious setting
this is not a process for making the anxiety go away it's very important when
people are pulling off these rituals in a religious setting it's not to make the
anxiety go away it's to share it it's to share it over time and space with a
larger community it's to take this nameless dread and to give it a name and
to have that name come with feeding instructions and all sorts of rules for
how to please the source of the named dread at this point it's not to make the
anxiety go away it's to make the anxiety share it now from this transitioning
from this notion that okay in the right setting the same exact trait that can
ruin your life can in fact be enveloped rewarded welcomed protected in the
context of religious belief now taking it one step further yeah question
sure no it definitely doesn't but from that standpoint this is speaking to one
aspect of what it's doing and we still haven't come to the question that was
up there before isn't there an ecological reason why there should be
these rituals about cleansing and food preparation we'll come to that shortly
but the other point you brought up maybe this is to foster a sense of
community but this comes back to the question around there before why should
people in a communal sense feel better why should we all feel better when we do
rituals and our rituals of counting the stairs and making sure the application
really went down the mailbox why do we feel even better when we do it in the
context of the community you're absolutely right that these are meant to
foster the group shared features of religiosity and spirituality the question
then becomes why does it work why do we respond to it why do we need shamans
and why do we respond to this ability to share these customs why is it the trade
of 18 year olds all over the world to try to invent a whole bunch of
generationally shared rituals that lets the world know I have nothing what so
ever to do with those appalling people who embarrass me my parents what's that
whole separation that goes in why is it that individuation is very often going
hand-in-hand with I need a community to do this individuation with that in the
sense is the question and that kind of brings us to this next issue looking at
sort of a next scale of this application of this ritualism by far one of the
weirdest stories that Franz Kafka ever wrote was the hunger artist and this is
a story about a person who performs starving his performance is he comes
into a town and he's locked up in a cage in the middle of town and he
entertains he performs feet performs there by starving himself and people
come and watch him starve and initially you read this and this sounds like one
of the more bizarre parables that Kafka has come up with until you read that
during the Middle Ages there were hunger artists there were people who
performed in European cities starving themselves in a ritualistic way for
people to come and watch suddenly we now look at the next level the notion of
performing rituals and people who are very good at it once again what are
religious leaders about mostly these days we think of them in terms of people
who are empathic people who are able to use the religious tradition they come
from to make people treat each other better to come for people during
troubled times but back to that issue that some of the time what a religious
leader is about is someone who is excellent at doing rituals and when you
look at the history of religion not only do you have the capacity for somebody
to suddenly lose themselves to finally have the same life destroying rituals
being sanctioned and protected you have people who could make a living performing
the rituals you can have people who are aptly rewarded for doing so some
examples starting off with traditional Hinduism there is a mantra there called
the Gayatri mantra which I'm sure I'm mispronouncing but in traditional
Brahmanism you are supposed to say this mantra 2,400,000 times in a
lifetime to guarantee a good afterlife and what happens is you have these
aging captains of industry who are worried that may not have quite gotten
the right number in there and are feeling the years catching up with them
and what do you do you hire yourself a bunch of Brahmins to come and say the
prayer 2,400,000 times for you and you say it in appropriate multiples there are
set rules you hire 240 of them so each of them says 10,000 100,000 1000 10,000
each of them says a whole lot of them and they all say the same number and there
are rules for what sort of tent city you put up for them in your backyard and
what sort of feast you throw for them you hire people to come and do the
rituals for you that get you your afterlife switching over to Judaism
these rules of Orthodox food preparation there is an entire job you can get
built around ritualistic preparation of food now there is a certain primary
level of this which is people who make a living making sure food is prepared in
a kosher way that they slaughter animals things of that sort but there's a whole
second level people who make a living watching the folks who prepare the food
you have rabbis who make a living sitting around in slaughterhouses and making
sure the animals are slaughtered in a ritualistically appropriate way these
guys don't do anything with their own hands their entire job is to watch and
make sure the rituals are done right so that you can produce like fat-free
tofu hot dogs that would bring a smile to the lips of the patriarchs it's done
so ritualistically correctly these guys make a living doing this and then the
version probably we are most familiar with the American experience you have
the high school graduation you have the opening of the new town whatever and
what happens the local clergyman comes out and does a convocation says a
prayer is invited to come and do a ritual to mark this community transition
and our response here is well yeah of course that's the guy's job and that's
exactly the point you could make a living doing these rituals and you can do
that job these days complete with health insurance and a retirement package
and a 401k and all of that you make a living doing rituals and when you look
at the history of religion suddenly what you see is an inevitable outcome of that
if there's somebody who's spending all his time washing his hands ritualistically
for the good of the community there's some peasant out there who's got to work
by the sweat of his brow to make bread for two people instead of one and there's
an amazing novel a science fiction novel and absolutely caught this which struck
me as like one of the truly horrible novels in terms of writing style almost
as bad as as them up but in there was this brilliant idea book called Xenocide
by a writer named Orson Scott Card and had this brilliant idea that absolutely
caught this and this was on as always a multi-planetary empire and the people
running the evil empire figured out the people on some planet were biologically
very very prone towards being extremely smart we could dissect that in lots of
ways perhaps the particular prenatal environment on that planet but they
nonetheless worried that this planet had great danger for producing
revolutionaries that were gonna leave the overthrow of the empire so what they
did was invent a virus a virus which caused obsessive compulsive disorder and
they infected a subset of people on this planet with the virus and the virus
integrated into the DNA so it would be passed on multi-generationally and
suddenly you had a subset of people who were paralyzed with OCD with counting
rituals and all of that and what did they manage to foist off on the rest of
the population these were religious experiences they were having and within a
few generations this had become a priestly class who sat around all day
carrying out their obsessive rituals and the rest of the population couldn't
begin to think of revolting against the empire because they were spending all
day long having to come up with enough food to feed the priestly class and what
you suddenly had was a paralysis built around an entire class that does
nothing other than carry out these rituals and that planet was no worry to
the rest of the empire at that point what you wind up seeing is that truly
involved ritualistic religious belief is often at the cost of doing anything
else there's a spectacular example of this historically and this is a 16th
century Augustinian monk in Germany named Luder and this guy happened to
have left a lot of written records and this guy is a classic example of this
he was the son the only son of a very aggressive very violent father there was
some suggestion that the father had in fact killed somebody once and a brawl
the son was absolutely terrified of him and was extremely obedient to him very
anxious very psychosomatic young man one day he is out for a walk it's caught in
a lightning storm out in an open field has a panic attack there because the
lightning storm makes a devotional agreement at that point if he can
survive this lightning storm he will become a monk he promises God that he
survives he becomes a monk and he's absolutely paralyzed with his
ritualistic training he leads records about when he had his first mass he
fainted beforehand he was so nervous about doing it wrong the mass went on
three times the length it was supposed to because he kept having to stop and
start over again because he was sure he had done something wrong he spent
approximately five hours a day in confession with his priestly mentor
there his sort of advisor there confessing to every this is a guy who
lived in a monastery he didn't have a chance to do anything sinful but he'd
be in there five hours a day when I said this prayer I wasn't mindful enough
about it I did it by rote when I did this I wasn't thinking enough about this I
pretty sure I didn't wash my hands enough before doing this prayer I did this
wrong God is angry at me for doing this I'm sure God is angry at me for doing
this and records his mentor this elderly priest eventually in exasperation
said one of the most astonishingly modern psychoanalytically insightful things
imaginable he said enough already God isn't angry with you for some reason you
are very angry with God God doesn't care about how many times you're washing your
hands and the most definitive thing about this young man this young priest
was something he left in his records he washed hours and hours a day an exact
quote from him the more I wash the dirtier I get and this is OCD and why
do we know so much about this man because we know him 500 years later not
by his Latin name of Luther we know him by his more westernized name of Martin
Luther this was Martin Luther the founder of Protestantism and these were
the transitional events in his life and talk about somebody who takes his
personal affliction and turns it into perhaps the most influential event of
the last thousand years in Western European history this is someone who
turned it into the biggest display of failing to obey his father that anybody
has seen in the history of Catholicism and this was a person paralyzed by
obsessive compulsive disorder so what we get here at this point is the obvious
question who invented knocking on wood for good luck who's the Hindu who had
some sort of obsession with the number 24 or the Jew with an obsession with the
number 18 who got this belief that God was completely obsessed with the numbers
of bones in the body and that's how many things you should do well we have here
is not only the recognition that if you are OCD religion can provide a
sanctuary if you are OCD in the right setting you can in fact make a living by
being religiously ritualistic but the recognition that probably people with
strong obsessive compulsive tendencies had something to do with the invention of
many of these rituals I suspect historically that's where it has come
from so that brings up the issue that was brought up before why should these
rituals be so similar you look at the prohibitions for example in Judaism more
than 200 of these have to do with food preparation and cleansing you see the
sequence in any of these and the top four in OCD are identical to the top four
in all of these religions cleansing of the body food preparation entering and
leaving significant religious places and numerology numbers why should that be
basically two types of explanations one is we may be seeing some sort of
convergence it's not by chance that people are highly ritualistically
concerned with making sure their bodies are clean and that their food is
correctly prepared and I suspect that has part to do with it but I suspect what
we're also seeing and with records of people like Martin Luther what we're
also seeing is because some of the people who invented some of these
religious rituals had a background of OCD maybe not fully paralytic versions but
nonetheless somebody spending five hours a day washing his hands and five hours a
day confessing about how he didn't wash his hands enough this does not seem to
be a mild version the more I wash the dirtier I get okay what I think you wind
up seeing is that historically all sorts of folks generating rituals OCD is
estimated to have an incidence anywhere from one to ten percent in the
population defending on how you define it the continuum and what you have is I
suspect in periods of religious crisis cultural crisis during a period of
persecution during the period where whatever is currently in shape is not
working the right person at the right moment comes forward and in effect says
this is how I have been privately honoring our Lord all these years and I
am offering it to all of you to see this is what I have been doing and in the
right place and time it catches on and it turns into the thing that is the
ritual for the rest of the community within decades okay so what I've been
suggesting here and what I also emphasize is none of this is original with
me except for the notion that OCD has something to do with the invention of
these rituals these ideas go back decades go back centuries that there is a
parallelism between the symptoms of what we call schizotypillism and the
metamagical backbone of religious theology there is a parallelism between
what we call obsessive compulsive disorder and the ritualism of mainstream
orthodox religion and this key point that the exact same behaviors which in one
context destroys your life has you peripheralized do it right do it in the
right context and it is not peripheralizing it makes you very honored and
powerful there are more themes yeah wonderful question would you expect to
see different incidences of OCD type traits in different cultures depending on
how secular the society is how ritualistic the religion is you look at
for example Catholicism or high Episcopalianism highly ritualistic
compared to Lutherans or Unitarians or Quakers at the other end would you
expect to see different different incidences absolutely I don't know if
anybody studying that that would be exactly a prediction you would expect
okay a related one which taps into the lecture on Friday would you expect to
see differences in the incidence of depression depending on religiosity and
boring do you see that with a vengeance one of the healthiest things you could
do with your life is to be religious and to be highly religious it is a very
strong protector against major depression religious belief extends your
life expectancy and that's after you control for it changes risk factors you
are less likely to drink to excess all of that what is the big issue in that
field is do the health benefits of religiosity merely come from the social
community that you get typically by being religious the question early in
the lecture today religiosity versus spirituality that might be a realm to
dissociate them spirituality if it's a very personal one you wouldn't get the
community do you still get the health benefits nobody knows at this point but
those are studies that people are doing but absolutely one of the greatest
things you can do out there to buffer yourself from depression is to be
religiously believing and walk through all the steps at the end of the lecture
the other day elements of control predictability explanation outlet and you
will see exactly how religion taps into that okay couple more threads here in
terms of making sense of some of the covariance between biological phenomenon
behavior that we can explain and patterns of religious belief back to
something we talked about earlier in the course take a hungry pigeon and put in
a cage and instead of the behaviorist circumstance where it has to press a
lever umpteen times to get food you randomly reward it and what we discussed
there was a pigeon has a strong psychic need to come up with an attribution
what did I do to cause this food to appear and what we went through was the
fact that if a pigeon is hungry enough and the reward is both big enough and
random enough the pigeon has a prepared learning state to make it think ah
whatever I just did is what caused that to occur and then you suddenly have
superstitious conditioning the capacity to get pigeons doing the most
outlandishly ritualistic things over and over and over in the belief that
that's the cause of the food appearing and what we heard was take a room full
of hungry pigeons and randomly reward all of them with food at different
points and come back a few days later and every pigeon is going to be having
its own private belief system built around in order to get food I have to
do x the enforcement of superstitious belief and that is the term that is
used in psychology and as we often have here is a question of is this word a
metaphor is this word an inappropriate metaphor or what is superstitious
belief and to go back to the question that came up here before why do we have
a societal need for shamans why do we have a societal need for much of this
because we are trying to explain the unexplainable we are trying to look for
causal links of things that may or may not be associated this is basically a
way of describing superstition how tight of a link do you need between cause and
effect to believe that there has been cause and effect and this is coming down
to statistical relations and if you allow yourself to believe that this prayer
could be answered but it wasn't this time because I wasn't concentrating
enough I need to do it a bit more fervently all of that you have a system
that allows us very readily to see causal links that may not be there now
what is the next interesting neurobiological piece of this is that
take animals take rats and damage their hippocampus and what you get with
hippocampal damage then is you have more trouble making causal sequential
links and events what you wind up seeing and this next sentence is meant to be
as provocative as it will sound is when you have rats with hippocampal damage
they are more vulnerable to superstitious conditioning
essentially what that is saying is that as you have a damaged hippocampus
you have less of a capacity to tell the difference between accurate cause and
effect linkages and ones that are merely statistically hinting of that or ones
that may not be in the slightest bit connected with each other hippocampal
damage and rats have a lower threshold for superstitious conditioning and we
can very readily run with that one in terms of what the implications of that
might be going on our usual sequence from in order to appreciate a biological
effect big gross lesion sort of stuff to once again the much more subtle realm
we all differ in our number of hippocampal neurons and the amount of this
enzyme and the amount of myelin and all the biology we know all the
individual differences a last disorder that winds up being interesting
there is a type of epilepsy which when you have it something happens to your
religious belief system and this is one of its characteristic features
epileptic seizures as I think we've discussed in here have characteristics
as to what part of the brain they originated and this is epilepsy that
originates in the temporal lobe the temporal lobe containing the hippocampus
the amygdala it's a big limbic area the temporal lobe temporal lobe epilepsy
and about 30 years ago a neurologist named Geshwin who was at Harvard he was
probably the most influential neurologist of the 20th century and
Geshwin published a paper first describing what is now called temporal
lobe personality which is a cluster of personality traits that become far more
common in people with temporal lobe epilepsy once again not everybody with
this personality profile has epilepsy lurking there not everybody with
temporal lobe epilepsy gets this profile but statistically at a higher than
expected rate what do you see with temporal lobe personality first off the
person becomes extremely serious and humorless okay you might say I would
become extremely serious and humorless if I suddenly came down with epilepsy
what's the appropriate control looking at other types of epilepsy's of
equivalent severity it's specific to temporal lobe so you get the seriousness
next thing you get is what is termed neophobia you don't like new things you
like to just do very familiar sorts of stuff the same small circle of friends
the same very relatively limited range of experiences okay if I had epilepsy I
would suddenly get a lot more sort of involuted in my lifestyle once again the
controls or other types of epilepsy's next thing you see is this bizarre trait
called hypergraphia which is people with temporal lobe personality begin to
write obsessively they feel a pressured need to write fourth trait and the most
interesting one of all is people with temporal lobe personality become
obsessively interested in religious and philosophical subjects and these are not
people with uncontrolled seizures happening all the time these are people
who seizures are relatively well controlled with medication and once
again well if I have this horrible neurological disease I'd suddenly start
getting more introspective but once again control for with the other types of
epilepsy and the classic temporal lobe patient that you see is somebody who is
meeting a new neurologist and says oh hi great to meet you you know I very
strongly believe that a patient should be more than just their symptoms so I've
prepared this 60 page document here which is my philosophy about life and
meaning and at the next week's appointment comes back with a 40 page
addendum this is what you wind up seeing and there's this fabulous story told
showing that it's not that you get religious you get interested in
religious and philosophical subjects this great story showing this and this was
apparently shortly after guess when first published this paper and he had
some neurology resident who one day all the residents were in there and the
neurology resident was summarizing some patient this was some 13 year old boy in
there with temporal lobe epilepsy and he went through the meds and all of that and
how the kid was doing and at the end said oh by the way I just read your paper
on that personality stuff this kid doesn't fit at all doesn't fit in the
slightest clearly doing some chest thumping kind of territorial stuff that
the big man there and guess when says oh yeah really how come and he said because
I asked him if he's religious he said no he's not guess when says idiot out of my
way pushing him goes stormy down the hall and the residents running after him
bursts into this kid's room and says oh hi I'm Dr. Geshwin and puts it through
a neurological exam and all of that and goes through and asked him to be like
baseball has the weather all of that and then offhandedly says well by the way
are you religious and the boy says no I'm not and then guess when asked the
critical question he says oh how come and this 13 year old kid gives this hour
long lecture about the internal inconsistencies of Christ's Sermon on
the mountain the epic of Gilgamesh and sort of Enkidu's treatment of this and
Bertrand Russell's critique of Christ and and like Geshwin just leaves the
residents in their torture to listen to this kid for an hour and it's not
becoming religious it's becoming fascinated with the subject and there's
even been a paper published in a neurology journal doing the sort of
paleo forensic neurology by neurologist speculating someone who in history had
temporal lobe epilepsy and this was Saint Paul Saint Paul who had seizure
or is as documented no evidence that the guy was particularly humorous the guy
was hyper graphic as hell and clearly had a very strong interest in religious
and philosophical subjects and you know this is fun but what do you make of the
fact that somebody has an uncontrolled seizure in this part of the brain for 30
seconds once every six months and they become more interested in religious
subjects and at the end of the handout I cite a novel that was published a couple
years ago called lying awake fabulous novel by Mark Salisman talking about a
nun who is in the middle of a rather dispiriting life experience as a nun it
has not been what she was hoping for it is mostly been empty ritual and in the
last few years she's been having religious visions and this is the most
exciting thing that has ever happened to her what she also has to admit is she
has kind of become a star of her convent after being this very peripheral
nobody and they're publishing books about her visions and people are coming to
see her and what becomes apparent halfway through the book is that she has a
tumor in her temporal lobe which is causing temporal lobe seizures and
suddenly what does it mean that this is what these visions have been about what
does it mean that this is something that somebody in a white coat would call a
disease is this a disease and do I want my disease cured do I want this taken
away from me and it's extraordinary novel absolutely getting these features of
temporal lobe personality and getting at this issue which now is the core of what
this whole lecture has been what do we do with something like this what do we do
with the possibility that have an uncontrolled burst of action potentials
and one part of your brain for 30 seconds every six months and in a somewhat
deterministic way that makes you more interested in religious subjects now
summarizing here what I think is really important for me to emphasize is what I'm
not saying because that I kind of learned the hard way over the years I'm
touching on the subject in this class what things I am not saying I am not
saying ooh some snotty you got to be crazy to be religious that's nonsense
nor am I saying even that most people who are are psychiatrically suspect I'm
not saying that in the slightest what I'm saying is it is absolutely fascinating
that the same exact traits which in a secular context are life destroying
separate you from the community and in the right setting are at the very core
of what is protected what is sanctioned what is rewarded what is valued in
religious settings so often and that there could be an underlying biology to
this and what do we do with this what's most interesting here is even if this
describes one single person I need to put cards on the table I was raised in an
extremely religious orthodox upbringing and I had a complete break with it when
I was about 14 and that process of completely breaking to the point now
where I have no religion I have no spirituality I'm utterly atheist and in
passing it is probably the thing I most regret in my life but is something I
appear not to be able to change the process of getting to that point I view
in retrospect as one of the most defining things in my life the process of
turning into that person from who I was what are we to make of the possibility
that each one of us goes through some equivalent version in our life deciding
how religious or irreligious we are going to be for a lot of us that are
among the most defining features of who we are where we have wound up with this
and how we got there what do we make of the fact that even if there's one case
in all of human history of someone who got to wherever they were instead because
of a neurotransmitter hiccup because of a genetic influence because of something
that we would see as deterministic as your visions are due to a tumor in your
temporal lobe what are we to do with this what I am also saying here is it is
just as interesting to ask this question about why some of us lose faith as to
ask this about why some of us gain faith it is just as biological it is
simply much less studied because there are fewer examples of it to study out
there but it is just as biological of the process and it is just as interesting
if it has only been one person in all of history once again coming to this issue
what are we to make of who we are if even in one case somebody has arrived at
that point because of just a storm of neurotransmitter abnormalities rather
than the journey that all of us associate with helping to define who we
are now this now is a segue to Wednesday's lecture which is going to look
at all of these issues in a much more subtle realm of this biology of what
makes our personalities personalities and this is finally moving outside of the
realm of them and their diseases for what makes us us and at the core of this
is what does it mean that biology may have as much to do with it as I will
hopefully convince you of on Wednesday so let's pick up that
