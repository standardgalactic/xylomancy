You said that it was, well, initially human nature,
or understanding human nature, but also reading Chomsky,
which is clear from reading your work.
I don't want to call you a Chomsky,
and that's like a crass fear of putting it,
but it seems like you're settling more on,
let's say, Chomsky's side over someone like B.F. Skinner.
So if you don't mind, I would love for you
to sort of elucidate this ongoing,
I don't want to call it a war,
but debate between the Skinner's side and Chomsky's side.
And in fact, in one podcast,
you even said that this debate is still ongoing.
It's not like it's done.
Yeah, very much so, nothing changes.
Yeah, there's not a conclusion,
this is the answer sort of thing,
which is what's lovely about science, in my view.
So what's this debate in linguistics
and cognitive science between Chomsky and Skinner?
So that debate at the time was how to explain behavior
and generally in linguistic behavior in particular,
and Skinner was hoping to explain that
in terms of properties of the information
that's available to us.
So what's out there in the environment
and the responses and the links between them
and associations that we formed between them.
And basically the idea is that to explain how we behave,
which is all he cared about, all we need to do
is look at the properties of what's out there
rather than what the organism brings internally
to that, how the organism views the stimulus
and how the organism chooses to response.
And what Chomsky made very clear is that the study
of behavior ought to start with the study of the organism.
It's really kind of, maybe you can think about it
as a form of biology, thinking about what is it
that the organism brings with themselves to this task.
So to make it very concrete.
So why is it that you understand the sentence,
how is it that you have a sentence such as,
John is eager to please, how do you know that it's John
who is being pleased, whereas if John is easy to please,
then sorry, put it the other way around.
So if John is easy to please, it is the one
who is being pleased is John, whereas if John is eager
to please, then he is pleasing Bill or somebody else, right?
And what Chomsky made clear is that interpretations
such like that the only way to make sense of them
is to figure out what is it that the person knows
about language and how they encode information
that's available to them.
Any point of doubt that our ability to do so
to encode information that's available to us
is constrained in part by innate principles of language
that he called universal grammar.
And would you say that's sort of something like innate
knowledge that you write about in this book?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So as I read Chomsky, this is primarily a treatise
on human nature and about innate knowledge
which he happened to advance in the domain of language
but I always read him as a philosopher essentially.
Certainly, yeah.
I mean, he in fact, I believe he was the,
he chaired the Department of Philosophy at MIT
probably for a long time.
So he has a really good background in philosophy certainly.
I always professed so with the idea of universal grammar,
I've always been thinking about that idea like
is universal grammar itself this type of innate knowledge
and is it something that we can sort of study analytically?
And empirically.
Empirically, beautiful.
And I would say experimentally, yeah.
So all you need is to start with a good theory
of what you think universal grammar is all about
and then go to the lab and try to figure out
do you have evidence for this thing?
And it's not easy, but it's doable.
I see, I see.
So if you could play a bit of devil's advocate
because I've read, in fact, apart from Chomsky's
political work of course, I've read his book On Language
which was an excellent read
and I found it quite hard to read as a neophyte
to be totally honest.
But I do know there are certain people still in the field
as you said, it's an ongoing debate
that kind of are either critical or disagree
with some of Chomsky's ideas or let's say
values of universal grammar.
So what are the current criticisms of this idea
of innate knowledge or universal grammar?
So to make it clear, I think that in fact,
the majority of the field no longer things
that no longer sides with Chomsky.
I'm not totally convinced in my reading of the evidence
that that's right and that's the right conclusion.
The debate as I see it in the domain of language
have always structured or have always centered
on two issues.
One is what is the machinery that you need
to represent language?
So what kind of representations that you have
and what and are they structured?
Are they structured in a systematic way?
Do you need something that is akin to algebraic rules
or all you have is basically associations,
very rich set of associations
which apparently this is what GPT is doing, AI is doing.
So A is what kind of representations do you have
and do you need explicit structure in your data,
so to speak?
The second question is where these representations
and the rules, the way you operate
over these representations,
where is all this machinery coming from?
And is it in parts specific to language?
So are you born with some principles
that are unique to language
and that's what allows you to acquire language
or are you relying entirely
on generic mechanisms that operate across domains?
So what is your machinery
and how specific it is and where it's coming from?
These have always been the questions.
And the debate these days are centered on A,
whether there are in fact algebraic rules.
So this is huge debate about that,
which has been increased and confounded by the rise of AI
because proponents of that state,
like look, you have the systems that seem to do just fine
and it's not clear, but some people,
there is a question of whether they in fact
have any algebraic representations at all
and the range of possibilities range between those who say
there aren't any structured representations in there at all
or that maybe they start without them
and they grow them somehow.
And all this becomes really difficult to tell
just because there is so much data
that these systems are exposed to that it's really hard.
So one of the tests that you know,
how do you know that there is an algebraic rules?
One of the way to test it is to look at
generalizations, can you generalize to items
that are not similar to anything that you've seen before?
But if you basically your data set includes
everything that we have,
then it becomes very difficult to know
whether you'd in fact generalize or not.
So that makes the whole question of machinery
very difficult to decide.
Questions of innateness are difficult to decide
for two reasons, A, the success of AI
that kind of presents a big challenge.
The other reason is often time when you point out
that there are universals across languages.
So, and this is one of the main argument
or an important argument to foreign aidness
is to argue that, hey, we look at language after language
and they all show a certain property.
So in my work, we looked at syllable structure
and the fact that languages prefer structures
such as blog to structures such as all bog, L, B, O, G.
That seems very clear, but the thing about this
as well as many other preferences
is that there is a correlation
between what languages like to do
and what the functional pressures of our body dictate.
So if I ask my undergraduates, why blog?
Then everybody tells me that, what to say.
And then intuitive theory behind it
is that it's those functional pressures,
meaning how is it is for you to say
that the constraints are you,
articulatory system and an audition
that they are driving the force.
And in every area of language universal,
I don't, in many areas of linguistic universals,
you find such correspondences
between what languages like to do
and some functional explanation.
Phonology is probably the area
where you see those things most clearly,
but nowadays people are exploring
those ideas elsewhere as well.
And the problem is that when people find those correlations,
they assume causation, meaning they,
if you find any functional explanation of what's going on,
people kind of jump to the conclusion
that it's this functional cause
or functional factor that is causing the structure
that you see.
So in this specific case, so why do you prefer a blog?
Because it's easy to say, or because it's easy to hear.
That's what my undergraduates think.
And so do professional scientists.
And to me, it's not a done deal.
To me, this is an empirical question
that you need to go and explore, as indeed we have.
And there are ways to do so.
So the fact that you find correlation
in principle is ambiguous between two explanations.
One is it's not language, it's not your G.
It's the functional system,
the sensory and motor systems that are driving the cart here.
That's what makes language the way it is.
But the alternative possibility is,
well, maybe it is abstract linguistic principles
that are doing the driving,
except for those principles are not entirely crazy.
They're not entirely arbitrary,
rather they have evolved so that they optimize
those sensory and motor pressures,
which I don't think is super surprising.
So that predicts that, yes, you will find some correlation
between putative UG and those sensory and motor pressures,
but what's pushing the cart, so to speak,
is UG rather than sensory motor system.
And merely showing a correlation
doesn't adjudicate between these possibilities.
So in my work, we took it very seriously.
So for example, to figure out whether it's blog
that's doing it, I'm sorry,
whether the preference of blog is coming from,
it's easier for you to say than in collaboration
with my colleague, Alvaro Pascualeone,
who is a neuroscientist
who does transcarnial magnetic stimulation.
What we did is zapped the motor system
that controls the articulators, the leaps specifically,
and looked at what this is doing
to your linguistic preferences.
And conversely, what happens when you zap Broca's area
and what we found is a dissociation between them.
So the point is, these are questions
that you need to explore.
You may or may not like the evidence that we produce.
I think they're clear, but my point is not
to defend the solution, but rather to defend the method.
I am very concerned about that time
to jump from correlations to causation.
I think this needs to be sorted out.
And I think it's this disagreement
that is behind a lot of the ambiguity
that we're having in the field right now.
April 1st, I did, in fact, read a blog post
written on your work from your lab by Northeastern University.
And so, correct me if I'm wrong,
in like a very elementary level, if I could put it this way,
is it that you're at the moment claiming
that it's as if these like UG
or these abstract principles, they aren't physical,
they aren't arbitrary and random,
but they've kind of evolved to suit our existence
as Homsapians, the same way, let's say a physical limb
or something has evolved.
Exactly, yeah, that's the working hypothesis.
But again, I think for me, it's more important
to tell people that just showing a correlation
isn't necessarily proof, it's not a smoking gun of causation.
It's more important for me to emphasize
this methodological claim than to push
my own interpretation of the data.
So I think that there is probably a lot
that need to be done, many more controls
and to completely look at this question.
And we have contributed some, but by no means
I would argue that we completely resolved the issue.
What really bothers me is that the attempt
to view the correlation and to jump to the conclusion
that, oh, we know what's going on.
I think that's really unfortunate.
