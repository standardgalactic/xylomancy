Jacob Bell is a philosopher and writer.
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy
from the American Public University
and is doing his masters of research in philosophy
at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David.
The working title for his dissertation
is a Phenomenological Analysis
of the Structures of Meaningfulness.
Jacob's primary academic interests
include phenomenology and existentialism.
So Jacob, that's like the formal definition
or the formal bio, let's say.
Would you want to give an introduction yourself, Mayne?
I'll give a less technical introduction and say,
I like thinking about weird things
and philosophy is the perfect discipline
that'll have me to do that.
But yeah, no, I don't have anything else to add.
A Bachelor of Weird Things, that sounds good.
Sounds very much like what we're all interested in, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, so let's jump into it.
For starters, maybe let's get some definitions out of the way
to lay some groundwork.
So within your fields of interest,
some, let's say, terms would be philosophy of mind,
phenomenology and existentialism.
So maybe you could give us a bit of a elucidation
on what those terms are, how they interconnect
and correlate, but also how they are a part
of a broader philosophical framework
or a school of thought.
Yeah, so philosophy of mind,
I guess I understand that as a branch of philosophy
that investigates things like mind and consciousness,
which, I mean, to be honest,
is a really bad way of defining the topic
because you don't get any further than the phrase itself.
So I guess to go into it a little bit further.
If anybody is familiar with philosophy,
they've probably heard of things like physicalism
and idealism and dualism.
Those are like some, I mean, those are metaphysical theories,
but they're prevalent and they're always being discussed
in philosophy of mind.
So you might find people in philosophy of mind working
on trying to discern whether the mind is a physical thing
or if it's a separate substance
or if maybe it's fundamental,
like maybe a panpsychist sort of take on it.
So those are like some of the more popular topics
that philosophers of mind are working in, I guess,
something maybe a little more specific than that.
You get to think about ideas of perception.
What is what I'm perceiving the real world?
There's a representation that kind of plays
into philosophy of mind and metaphysics more broadly,
which then feeds into ideas like,
is the world a mental construct or is it independent of us?
And then you start to get into topics of realism.
And so it all kind of feeds back into each other,
but I think as far as contemporary philosophy goes
or philosophy of mind goes,
really what you're seeing,
or at least what I see 90% of the time
are people trying to struggle with where to place consciousness
as far as in a physical world, in a mental world,
in a dualistic world or as something fundamental.
So one thing I've learned recently being a neophyte
is that it seems that all the concepts of ideas and philosophy,
it never is arbitrary,
it isn't just come sort of deos, ex machina,
I don't know where, it does have an history.
And where would you, so if again,
I propose philosophy of mind,
where would you, is there a starting point
where at one point in the history of human,
let's say human knowledge,
people started getting interested in this topic,
or has it in some sense been the ultimate question,
time immemorial, ever since the dawn of consciousness,
let's say?
Which question specifically you're referring to?
Let's talk about philosophy of mind, for starters, yeah.
I mean, I think I came, I don't know if you,
say I was gonna, I wanna say pre-socratics,
but I think maybe shortly after the pre-socratics
with Plato,
because with the pre-socratics,
you see some pretty heavy metaphysical stuff going on,
but it's mostly like, is the world made up,
I mean, Democratists with the very early atomic theory,
you know, is everything Adam's been avoiding,
or moving around, or is everything water,
you know, is everything fire?
So you have this idea of like monism in the pre-socratics,
and-
Sorry, maybe because that's the top,
that term is quite a loaded term.
So monism is the idea that,
well, actually I'll let you explain,
Jacob, please, if you could explain what monism is.
Tom, so the term just signifies the idea
that everything is one,
or everything's made out of one particular type of-
Yeah, I guess that's just one way of putting it to you,
because I mean, I'm saying things are made out of one type
of stuff, so I'm kind of implying that we're talking
about substance-based philosophy,
substance-based metaphysics,
where like the pre-socratics talking about different types
of material that things might be made of.
And then, yeah, I guess that kind of leads into
a little bit of philosophy of mine,
when you get to Plato and talking about the ideas
and talking about theory of forms and stuff like that.
And so, yeah, I guess philosophy of mine really came
about around the time of Plato.
I mean, I'm not a great historian of science,
so somebody might be able to correct me on that, but-
Oh, better than me, mate, better than me.
So that's something I've always wondered
where initially the idea came from,
or was it more like the Aristotelian way
where people, instead of focusing on philosophy of mind,
humanity or human beings were more focused on,
let's say, the physical world,
the way a scientist would be.
How do things move, causality?
But I'm coming to realize, perhaps,
that it was the other way around,
even before people were interested in the physical world,
it was more on the world of mental constructs,
even things like ethics or metaphysics.
And maybe if you could get into, you know,
a few of your writings,
that shift where now it seems people are more physicalists
over, let's say, idealists,
and why that change has taken place.
And then in your paper, where you talk about meaning,
sorry, the ontology of meaning, one of your papers,
you kind of discuss what, let's say,
the social consequences of that could be.
But anyway, I don't want to get too carried away.
Okay, now we get to the interesting stuff.
The fields that you're interested in,
and this is what really drew me to your work,
that's phenomenology and existentialism,
or the way you put it, weird stuff.
So could you please explain in the field of weird stuff,
what that is, what those two terms mean?
And I guess, look, anyone could Google
what phenomenology or existentialism is,
but maybe personal to you, how do you give it?
And maybe juxtapose it with some other schools of thought
in philosophy and science to explain it, please.
Sure, before I do dive into phenomenology,
I just want to place one little caveat
on what I was just saying with regards to philosophy
of mind and saying that I was generally speaking
of Western philosophy.
I mean, if we start to look at Eastern philosophy,
I mean, we're going to be able to look back,
way before the pre-sacratic into philosophies
and different things like that to get certain ideas of,
I mean, they had some ideas of idealism
before I think any Westerns really did.
So we could look back in history much further
if we were looking to the East as well.
So I just wanted to make that point.
So I didn't seem ignorant to the other side of things there.
Of course, and I'm point well taken, point well taken.
Yeah, in fact, maybe now I need to kind of change
what I said before or add on to it
because certainly in a lot of Eastern philosophy,
consciousness and the mind, let's say, was a big part of,
well, more than philosophical practices,
more like spiritual practices, isn't it?
But now we get to the, this is probably semantics.
Like how do we discern spirituality and philosophy?
What's the difference?
But that perhaps the whole other conversation.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
I was gonna say that'd be a big conversation just in itself.
Oh, no, man.
Yeah, I'm hoping to, in fact, speak to John Mulvaney
because he seems like the perfect person
to discuss those nuances and subtleties
between all these terms.
Yeah, but saying that, so yeah, philosophy, sorry,
essentialism and phenomenology.
So phenomenology, I'll give a very brief,
I guess, like formal description of it.
I guess just trying to place it in history a little bit
because it's a relatively, I mean,
when we're talking about philosophy,
it's relatively new.
I mean, early 1900s, late 1800s when I've been host role
was working on publishing the first formal definition
the descriptions of what he took phenomenology to be.
So he's considered the founder of phenomenology formally anyway.
You can find threads of it throughout the history
of philosophy.
But yeah, so he published in the logical investigations
and then I think like then 12 years later in ideas,
kind of like almost like I got some guidelines
as to what phenomenology is or should be.
And very basically, it's the study of experience
as experience, and that doesn't say up a lot,
but it's really about taking your first person perspective
and kind of applying some rigorous analysis
to your experience and trying to figure out
what certain things mean, trying to make sense of things
as you experience them as opposed to kind of standing
outside of your experience or trying to put the experience
aside to get a more objective view of the world.
So it stands in direct contrast with things like
empirical science.
I mean, you're not gonna find an awful lot of phenomenology
there except in neuroscience.
And we can talk about that later.
I actually made a note
because I wanna talk about that a little bit.
Because of phenomenology, we're taking into consideration
our feelings and our moods and our personal values
and things like that as ways of understanding the world,
you could say, whereas as guides to understanding the world.
I mean, just for example, if we're talking about meaning,
which I'm sure we will get around to it later,
but I'll just make a comment here about it.
I mean, if we're talking about meaning in life,
if you take an objective,
try to take a scientific objective approach to that,
you're not really gonna be able to say what's meaningful
to you because you're gonna be kind of prevented
from considering your interests and your values
and kind of some of the things that you're passionate about,
the things that you're interested in life
and the way you feel about things.
And if you take all of that out of consideration,
I don't know how you would calculate a meaning in life.
Yeah, of course.
So maybe one example I enjoy, I read somewhere
is to kind of maybe use like an analogy.
It probably, I probably wouldn't even call it an analogy
because it's in fact, what a phenomenologist would do.
So as a phenomenologist, if I give you a,
and I'm sorry to kind of put you on the spot here,
but as a phenomenologist, if I give you a cup of coffee,
what would you do?
If you're told, let's say by Husserl himself,
a guy comes back from the dead,
from Resorex and tells you that,
study this cup of coffee as a phenomenologist,
how would you do that?
How would you process me?
Well, so I guess it depends on whose phenomenology we're using.
So after Husserl-
Spoken like a true philosopher.
After Husserl, you know, kind of formally came out
with the idea and it started getting,
I mean, he got a lot of interest right away.
I mean, it was a really,
it's for such a new and kind of
divergent approach to do in philosophy.
It gained a lot of interest really quickly,
but pretty much everybody who took over the approach
took it over in their own way.
And I don't think we could really say that anybody had
the same sort of phenomenological method.
I mean, Husserl had very specific techniques
that he wanted that he thought we should apply
while we're doing phenomenology, like the epic,
which is just to like suspend or bracket
what he calls the natural attitude.
And that's just to say like the kind of the habitual way
in which we interpret our experience.
He said, you know, let's just like put those aside.
Let's ignore that sort of stuff
and try to just pay attention to the experience
as we're experiencing it and describe it as such.
Now, you get it, right out following that,
you get Meryl Lopanti, a French phenomenologist
saying, you know, in his practice,
the phenomenology of perception.
One of the most important things we learned
about the phenomenological reduction
as Husserl described it is that
a full reduction is impossible
because we can never get rid of
all of our interpretive strategies.
If we did, we wouldn't be able to make sense
or describe our experience at all.
And he's not the only one that kind of criticized that.
I mean, Heidegger did to a much greater degree.
Heidegger has a very specific concept of phenomenology,
not necessarily what you think phenomenology should study,
but kind of the approach.
He thinks that the approach should be a specific way.
Like we're looking at, we're looking to derive
specific truths about the world and the phenomenon
in the world when we're using phenomenology.
And so he's there, everybody, I mean,
I guess all the phenomenologists are limiting in their views
on what phenomenology should do.
But I do wanna say something about the way
in which Heidegger defines phenomenology
because I think it's a very brilliant sort of description
of it.
And so Heidegger, when he's describing phenomenology
and being in time, but also in the lecture course,
given a few years before he published being in time,
and that lecture course is called History
of the Concept of Time.
Sorry, just to clarify, so being in time
is Heidegger's Machdemopus, right?
We should probably put that out, yeah.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you,
Jacob, keep going, yeah.
No, no, you're good.
Yeah, being in time is what he's most famous for.
Even though, I mean, he wrote a lot.
He has a lot of books, he has a lot of papers.
His later work differs a little bit from his early work,
but there's also a dispute as to how real the turn is
for later Heidegger and early Heidegger, yeah.
Yeah, and I'm not really knowledgeable enough
to comment on how different those two things are.
I'm kind of working my way chronologically
through his mother's work.
But yeah, in being in time and his earlier lecture course,
he described phenomenology by going back to the ways
in which the Greeks use the term phenomenon in logos.
So he's kind of taking apart the term phenomenology
and separating it and looking to the Greek definitions
of this.
And in the book, Heidegger says that, you know,
that the Greeks understood the term phenomenon
as this is gonna sound very obscure and esoteric,
but I'm gonna give hopefully an easier
to understand description afterward.
But he says, phenomenon is that which shows itself
in itself, it's a manifest.
Typical Heidegger.
Yeah, and the term for the Greeks also carried connotation
of like bringing something to life and eliminating.
And then the logos, Heidegger explained,
the Greeks understood by the logos,
something like discoursing,
but not just like, not just dial-clock
and not just the verbal utterance,
but it's more of a discursive communication
that lets something be seen.
And so you could think of the logos as words,
whether uttered or written down or what have you,
that point to something, they let something be seen.
It's kind of, it's bringing something to life,
it's bringing the phenomenon to life.
And so if we wanna understand this in a less obscure
and difficult way than Heidegger likes to put things,
we can say something like,
the logos points to the phenomenon
in such a way that the phenomenon becomes un-concealed
or the logos allows the phenomenon to come into view
by looking at out of experience
in such a way that it can be seen.
And so really, it's almost like your word should connect
with something that can be pointed out in experience
or can be shown in experience.
And so we're not,
and He contrasts this with the idea
of free-floating concepts and words and ideas.
And by that, He just means something like,
we don't wanna abstract away so much from experience
that we're just playing language games.
We want our words to be able to meet up with experience
in such a way that if I say something,
so like in some of my papers about meaning
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to point to experience,
I'm trying to point to particular experiences
and particular moments in particular experiences
where maybe someone might find meaning.
So I'm not, I'm just trying to bring something into view
using words and concepts.
I'm glad you said that, Jacob,
because in one of your papers, I forget which one,
you've sort of touched on this,
but a question that came to mind was,
so from the definition you gave,
definition of phenomenology,
how does that differ from, let's say,
the empiricist tradition or the empiricist approach,
which tends to be quite popular these days,
especially in the world of artificial intelligence,
where we think that our epistemology or our knowledge
or our truths of the world is revealed
purely based on empiricism,
which is experiencing, measuring things,
and that in some sense, the mind is a blank canvas
and the world just gives us information and input.
So from the empirical approach,
how does phenomenology differ?
So phenomenology is gonna differ in the sense that,
okay, so if we think about the empirical approach,
specifically as it pertains to the sciences,
we're trying to get a collection of experiences
that kind of compile and point toward the same
sort of thing and experience.
Now, a major difference, I guess,
is going to be what it is we're trying to discern
in empirical science, as opposed to something like
high-degrees phenomenology,
the way that I just described phenomenology.
With a scientific and empirical approach,
we're usually looking at objects
and we're trying to figure out
what sort of properties these objects have.
And so, I mean, I guess physics or chemistry
is a great example of that.
And we're trying to see maybe what house
two entities interact with each other.
And we're going to perform experiments to do that
and we're going to try to replicate the experiments.
And we're going to try to not let our first person
perspective influence exactly what we're investigating.
So phenomenology is going to differ from that.
In that we're not collecting data
and we're not measuring stuff.
We're experiencing, we're trying to pay attention
to the experience as it's experienced.
So you're not going to measure your experience
of meaning, say, you're going to more so
if you're doing a phenomenology
and you're trying to discern maybe
what you find meaningful,
you're going to more sort of reflect
on maybe the way that you feel
when you were participating in a certain activity.
And from there, you might also start to look
at the structures of the experience,
more so than just the feeling of the experience
which might be what's involved in this activity
or what's involved in this experience.
What are the things that are essential
to the experience without which I could no longer say
that it was a meaningful experience?
Those are the sorts of things that phenomena,
the sort of questions phenomenology is going to ask.
And specifically high digger,
because specifically for high digger,
he's wanting to discern the a priori structures
of existence and experience,
which is just to say a priori meaning always already there.
Like what's necessary, what structures are necessary
for this to exist or for me to have this particular experience?
Yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that for now
because otherwise I'm going to get into a really deep,
or you can ask a clarifying question
otherwise I'm just going to go on at the end.
No, no, that was perfect, mate.
I think in many ways you lead me to my next question.
I mean, I thought we were going to discuss existentialism too
because obviously it's kind of like the precursor,
not the precursor, but it's highly correlated
to phenomenology.
But perhaps since we're already on this topic,
in some sense, I kind of regret even asking that question
because I'm coming to realize
that maybe it's not fair to ask questions such as,
oh, what's the difference?
Or what's the stark difference
between phenomenology and science?
Because if you think of a field like, let's say,
psychology or cognitive science,
those fields have had a massive influence
by thinkers like Merleau Ponty
or Heidegger, by phenomenologists.
So, well, the question I was going to ask is,
how does phenomenology,
and I was also going to say existentialism,
but we didn't get to that still.
But let's just say, how does phenomenology differ
from a more scientific approach?
But maybe to make things even a bit more interesting,
let's talk about, in fact, how does it relate
to fields like psychology and cognitive science
where in the world of, in the scientific approach,
what we always try and do is take the,
remove the subject, so remove the subjective experience.
But clearly, there are some fields,
even within science, but you can't do that.
You can't remove the subject
from cognitive science or psychology.
So maybe to make things a bit more interesting,
how do they correlate, how do they connect
to phenomenology, those fields I mentioned?
Sure, sure.
So I want to comment on cognitive science
just a little bit first,
and I want to maybe dive into a little bit
of neuroscience and how phenomenology might be related
because I actually, I presented a paper last year
at a philosophy conference hosted by a university
in the Czech Republic on this topic
of phenomenology neuroscience.
But before I get to that, you know,
something that I really appreciate about cognitive science
is that it really embraces the subjective experience.
And like you said, you can't remove that
from cognitive science.
Cognitive science, necessarily.
And I mean, so they're,
I think the most prevailing approach
in cognitive science right now is 4E cognitive science,
and that's just the 440s.
I always forget one,
but I had to say it's embedded in its embodied,
inactive, and I, like I said,
I always forget the fourth one.
I don't know why.
But I'll leave a little caption or whatever,
just too far here, it was all good.
Yeah, have somebody place in the comment.
I'm gonna take the video.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it says, it's fine.
But a lot of it, so a lot of those ideas,
really, I mean, I believe we have an inception
in phenomenology.
I mean, they're, you know, especially in Heidegger
with Heidegger's idea of being in the world,
you know, which we'll get to.
But it's just this idea
that there's a more holistic structure to the world
and the existence that we need to take into consideration
when we're trying to understand things about the world
and trying to understand things about ourselves
and maybe the way in which we interact with the environment.
And so I think phenomenology played at least the role
in trying and getting a lot of those ideas
going for cognitive science.
Now, as far as neuroscience goes,
and he has a Neal set, I'm sure you've heard of a Neal set.
Yes, I have, yeah.
He recently wrote quite a popular science book
right on the brain.
And so he does a lot of work trying to map
the brain correlates of certain experiences.
So he's trying to see like what's going on in the brain
at a given time when someone's having
a particular experience.
And he's trying to build that map out.
And you can't build that map
if you don't have good phenomenology.
Because if you think, just think about it,
if we think about it simply, as far as,
okay, let's say brain region X lights up
when I have experience Y.
And let's say we can gather all the data we want
about the brain structure,
and we can reproduce it and map it as much as we want.
But if we don't have a good description of the experience,
we're not gonna know what we're mapping
this brain activity to.
And so in order to have good correlative mapping,
we have to have good phenomenology.
We have to have like a good description of the experience.
And we have to have people, the participants in the study
that they're studying,
trying to get this correlative mapping going.
They have to be familiar with the experience,
not only as it is experienced,
but they have to understand what it is
that the neuroscientists are trying to map.
Like, what experience do you want me to have?
So then I can tell you what I'm having it.
So you can mark down what's going on in my brain
when I'm having that experience.
And so you have to have a whole lot
of phenomenology going on.
Not only the person being the participant,
being able to recognize the experience
and being able to communicate that to the researchers,
but the researchers also have to have
a pretty rich phenomenological description
of what it is they want their participants to experience.
And that way they know precisely when the experience
has started, because I mean,
there might be like a very important,
as far as neuroscience goes,
there might be a very important spike
in a particular brain region
that they are trying to map to a very specific,
maybe milliseconds of an experience.
And if you don't get that right,
it's just not going to be correct.
Your description is going to be wrong
and your correlative mapping isn't going to mean anything
because you might have one side of it,
but you're going to be missing the other side of it.
But also Jacob, what makes phenomenology even beyond,
let's say that, because see what we are talking about here,
it's, how can I put this?
Oh, by the way, so the book Anil said,
the person you were talking about, it's called Being You.
It's a very, I think it's a neuroscientific approach
to experience, but what that got me thinking
was as you were describing things,
we're thinking of very localized experiences.
So like, here's this pen, it's a black pen,
I'm looking at it, what's my,
to use a term philosophers use qualia, let's say,
and which parts of my brain lights up.
But when it comes to phenomenology, of course,
we even go beyond that.
We even go to what you write a lot about,
which is meaning and kind of the questions
that truly make us human in that sense, right?
So, and is that where we could maybe connect that
to fields such as psychology?
So I think, I mean, yeah, we could connect to there,
but I think we could still even bring it back
to neuroscience in the sense of,
so I know there was some research done,
trying to map brain activity and experiences of happiness.
And this particular study didn't even have a description
of what a happy experience might be as experienced.
And so that was one of the experiments
that I pointed to in my paper where I said,
I mean, they admit that one of the more difficult parts
of what they were trying to do
is the phenomenological aspect of it.
But at the end of the day, it's like, I mean,
it doesn't really, that research can't really mean anything
until you have a good description
of what a happy experience is.
And it's very difficult to do
because obviously not everything's gonna make everybody happy.
We're gonna have different, not necessarily definitions
of what happiness is, although we might have that too,
but different experiences are gonna make me happy
and different experiences are gonna make you happy.
And that gets even more complicated
when we start talking about meaning.
But another good example of this in neuroscience
is the flow experience.
So they're trying to kind of map out what's going on
in the brain when somebody has an experience of flow.
And not only is flow, I wouldn't say it's a rare experience
for a lot of people, but it's also not
an everyday sort of experience for people.
And so it can be a little elusive.
And again, so I think when we're talking about something
like that, we're trying to do some neuroscientific research
about flow and the flow experience,
we need to have good phenomenology
and we need to have good communication
around the experience in order,
I guess really in order to have good research
and to be able to expand our knowledge
of what it is that's going on when we're in flow.
And I'm very critical of science for a lot of reasons,
but I also think it's, I mean, we need science.
I'm not a science denier of any sort.
And I love seeing good research around these topics.
It's just unfortunate that a lot of the research
is just poor research
because they kind of shit on philosophy a lot.
And so I think-
Yeah, I think from what I read in one of your papers,
you've even used this term,
it seems like you're critical of scientism, isn't it?
It's not science per se, where scientism is this,
like it's an ontology, the part replaces the whole.
And in fact, I was watching this interview,
sorry, I'm going off on a tangent here,
but that's okay, it's a conversation.
I was watching an interview when Slavoj Cizek said that,
that the modern problem is,
the ultimate questions, do we have free will?
What is consciousness?
Even questions pertaining to meaning,
we've localized those questions to the scientific domain
where historically those things were normally answered
by philosophers and philosophers have the ability
to pull from different disciplines
and kind of connect them all together.
Where science, it's affected by what science is,
doesn't allow that.
So it seems that scientism is the problem.
And okay, I'm thinking how are we going to do this?
So I want to get to,
because I think this perfectly connects to your,
not your paper, but the article you wrote on Epoch Magazine,
which was the structure of meaning and experience,
rediscovering that which has been lost, that article.
But we didn't discuss existentialism yet.
So, since we're on the topic of meaning,
maybe we could give like a bit of a prelude
to what existentialism is and how that pertains to meaning,
and then we'll get to your article.
Because if not, I feel like we don't get carried away.
I also have a few more questions about Heidegger,
but I certainly want to discuss what you've written.
So Jacob, like maybe we'll start with existentialism,
and then we move on to your article if that's all right.
Cheers.
I understand existentialism as a philosophical study
of the human condition and all of its guts and glory.
Because I say that because a lot of existentialism
is around kind of gutsy topics like death,
and it can seem kind of dark,
especially when we're talking about things like anxiety
and dread, death, and,
but it's really, it's just,
it's an attempt to try to understand the human condition
and all of its facets.
I mean, so we have the human as the essential subject
and not just like the biological human
or the physical human, but more than that,
we have the experiencing human.
And so, I mean, we can see already
how it can connect up with phenomenology nicely.
But I mean, the existentialists are gonna ponder questions
like what does it mean to live and die?
What should I be doing with my life?
Should I act responsibly?
Do I have, what kind of freedom do I have?
Do I have any freedom?
What does death mean?
Is there meaning in life?
Is everything just meaningless?
So I guess very,
very human questions that most of us
have probably thought about at some point
and that's, it's approached in a rigorous manner though.
So that's, I guess that's what makes it,
I feel it's thinking about,
thinking about these things in a loose manner.
So it's approaching these very human questions
in a more rigorous manner.
Yeah, what's interesting is we've got colloquial terms
such as existential dread or existential crisis.
It seems like those terms wouldn't even exist
if not for the existentialists themselves
writing about these topics and was,
even with an existentialism days,
it's starting from caricature to nature,
to the French existentialist, of course, Heidegger.
It's, which is why, what,
probably perhaps what makes philosophy interesting,
you can never say this is what existentialism is, right?
It's the thinkers themselves don't agree with each other.
And in fact, people such as Camus,
who we would think as an existentialist rejected that term.
But I think you put it best record.
The way I think about it is that
it's the ultimate human questions,
leaving aside obstruous detach metaphysics
and coming back to our human experience.
And that, speaking about experience,
that leads us to your article.
So I'll reread the title,
The Structure of Meaning and Experience.
By the way, not to flatter you too much.
You are a brilliant writer, mate.
I aspire to write like you one day,
especially on such obstruous topics.
It's well written, it's well written.
Thank you.
The structure of meaning experience,
rediscovering that which has been lost.
So obviously I read the article,
but for let's say for anyone who hasn't read it,
maybe give a bit of a summary
of what you were trying to cover
and convey in this article.
Obviously all the links down below in the description.
And this one's on Epoch Magazine.
Yeah, so I will preface what I'm going to say
with the very honest answer that or honest comments
that I'm a better writer than a speaker.
So if you're listening to this
and I sound like I'm all over the place,
I would ask if you read some of my papers and articles,
it might make more sense.
I could be all over the place when I talk.
Okay, so anyway, so in that article,
you know, it was one of the first articles,
well, I guess not one of the first,
but one of the first that I published
about meaning and meaningfulness.
And I was really trying to work out in that article,
kind of what my own perspective was on it
and how I wanted to communicate
what I was thinking about meaning.
And so I really like that article for that reason
because I think it's almost like a foundational piece
of writing that shows me the direction that I need to go
and to try to illuminate these ideas a little bit more.
But in general, what I'm doing in the article
is trying to go through and talk about
where we can find meaning and experience
as it's experienced.
And so I'm not appealing to analytic arguments
to try to convince you that meaning is real in that article,
which is what a lot of analytical philosophy is.
It's kind of creating a coherent argument
to try to convince or persuade someone
that something is true.
And they're often very isolated.
I try to take a holistic and phenomenological approach.
And so I'm trying to point to certain experiences
where I think people have found meaning
and where I have personally found meaning
in what people that I've talked to have said,
yeah, I find this really meaningful.
In trying to talk about the structures of that a little bit
and also illuminating those structures also means
describing what's necessary in the experience
or what might be necessary in the experience
for it to be a truly meaningful experience.
And I'll leave the introduction to that at that
and then see what questions you might wanna ask.
Sure.
So, meeting seems again like one of those terms
like consciousness, which is,
it seems to be a bit of a loaded term, isn't it?
So, what for you is a meaningful life?
So, I like to, so like you said,
it's a meaning is a very obscure and ambiguous term.
And I like to link this back to,
was it a priori or a gust?
I think it was a gust.
It said something about time.
I know what time is and so somebody asked me what it is
and then when I'm asked, I really, I can't figure it out.
I can't give a description or I can't explain what time is.
Or you could say meaning is like pornography.
You know it when you see it.
You know it when you see it.
Yeah, I mean, actually, I think that's a great,
a great, I purposefully did not give an analytic
of definition of meaning in that article
or really in any paper I think giving a definition of it
is kind of doing an injustice to it
because it's a whole sort of thing.
So, you have to experience it.
So, you know it when you feel it.
You know it when you experience it.
And so that's another reason why
rather than try to tell people what meaning is
for me, a meaningful life.
And I will say that I relative not subjective
but relative and I think there's a very important difference.
It's gonna be relative to each of our personal existences
and we find value in the things that make us feel purpose.
The things that sort of vitalize us.
Give us vitality.
Give us almost as zest, you know, as zest for life.
That I like to point to as indicators of meaning.
For me, a meaningful life is doing philosophy and writing
and having a few close friendships
and having a loving family.
And I think all of these things are important
for a holistic meaning.
Now in the article that we're talking about right now
I focused in on one type of meaning
because I think it's the easiest to point to an experience
and that's like a passionate activity.
So, I use the artist as an example in that article.
But it could just as well be a scientist.
It could just as well be a philosopher, a writer.
You know, I don't think you could put a limitation
on what sort of activities are meaningful
because that would just be quite absurd
because I'm sure somebody finds something very meaningful
that I would absolutely dread doing.
Actually, I know that's the case.
And so, it's gonna be relative.
So, I can say what's meaningful for me
and I can try to describe what's meaningful for other people.
Not in the sense that I'm gonna tell you
what you're gonna find meaningful,
but in the sense that this person that has practiced
a specific discipline, a specific art maybe
for their entire lives
and it's kind of like what they breathe and live
and it's their guiding passion.
I mean, I think that's a very good indicator
that they're finding something incredibly meaningful
about that endeavor.
And meaning certainly is not the same as happiness.
There's a lot of times where I'm writing
and studying philosophy where I'm not getting
some sort of immediate happy feeling from it
or pleasure out of it.
Sometimes it's very difficult and frustrating,
but there's maybe a transcendent value that I guess
I'm gonna use the phrase that you used
when last time we chatted, it's so lightified.
It lifts the spirit in a way that is distinct
from happiness and pleasure, but it's a passion.
Yeah, I'll leave it at that.
Yeah, because I mean, look, passions, it's amazing.
I in fact have a question, not pertaining to this article,
but one of your other papers where in fact,
you've used the word passion extensively,
the title of the papers,
you said that this is gonna be published soon in a,
so sorry, let me read out the title first,
passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.
This hasn't been published yet, isn't it?
You said it's gonna be published in a journal soon.
Well, that paper is still in review.
I have not gotten a communication
as to whether it will be published
or not the ontology of meaning paper,
that one's gonna be published
in Toronto's Journal of Philosophy in 2023.
Sure, sure, sure.
But maybe if people are interested,
they could probably tweet at you if you don't mind, of course,
and if they're interested in reading the paper,
because I don't wanna leave it,
because then I publish it,
I'm not gonna share them publicly.
Sure, yeah, someone's interested.
So yeah, I can't really circulate it
until I really have a decision from the journal,
but if anybody's interested in reading it
or looking over it or discussing it,
definitely reach out, I can send a PDF copy.
Yep, great.
All right, so meaning, this probably leads us
to a bit of a Hedegarian question.
I was gonna discuss Hedegar separately,
but why discuss Hedegar abstractly?
He himself wouldn't like that.
Let's connect it to your work.
You've said that we live in a techno-scientific era,
and he said that we are attempting to take a view
from nowhere in the modern world.
And when I read that bit,
I was even trying to connect that
to kind of this modern new age obsession with stoicism,
where it seems that everyone talks a lot about stoicism
being detached from the world.
And I don't know if that tightly correlates
to this idea of the view from nowhere.
Everything is just a cosmic phenomenon.
Nothing really matters in some sense, ultimately.
So I placed this question in two parts, Jacob.
Firstly, ultimately, what was Hedegar struggling with?
What was he trying to figure out in his work
and what were his concerns?
For instance, like in the essay,
a question concerning technology, essays like that.
And the second part of the question is, from his work,
how does that pertain to the question of meaning
and human experience?
So there is very upfront about the question that he's asking,
and it's, what is the meaning of being?
And that's so vague that nobody can get an idea
of what it is until they've read the whole book,
and then maybe you can understand the question after that.
But he's really just asking,
in what sense do things exist?
I mean, that's kind of what he's asking.
Maybe an easier way to understand the question.
And so he asks this question,
and he says that the tradition has really forgotten
about being and what being is.
And for Hedegar, and this is gonna kind of
come back around to his approach to phenomenology
as far as the idea that he thinks phenomenology should
discover or disclose the apriori structures of existence.
And so being for Hedegar is synonymous
with the apriori ontological structures of existence.
So the structures of experience and existence
that are necessary for us to be having the experience
that we're having right now.
And this is, so we can contrast this with science,
most certainly, and also traditional philosophy,
because traditional philosophy and science
is kind of working in this subject-object sort of framework,
and they're also working within mostly
a substance-based framework.
So we have a substance, so we have objects,
and objects are made out of a substance.
And what kind of properties do these objects have?
And this is another reason, I mean, and this is direct.
The reason why he was so against Descartes
and had a lot of criticisms of Descartes,
because Descartes is kind of perpetuating
these philosophical assumptions that he thinks
that Hedegar thinks are completely unfounded,
such as, I mean, what is it to be,
like what is the human person,
and Descartes's gonna say this immaterial consciousness,
that's the person.
So we're a substance, where he's bringing us back
to the substance-based sort of metaphysics.
Hedegar basically says, no, this is all wrong.
We need to look at being, and we can't look at being
when we're trying to look at objects and the properties,
because in order for us to even look at objects
in their property, so in a sense,
in order to even have an empirical science
that can try to discern properties
of certain substances and certain objects,
we need all these other things already in place,
and that's what he's pointing to
with the aphrioric structures.
And so that's kind of what Hedegar is up to,
in being in time, really.
And he's gonna say that we're sense-making beings,
I mean, we make sense out of all of our experiences,
and he goes through in very complex detail
what these structures are,
and kind of what the holistic structure of them is,
and so we have feeling, I mean, we have the stimulus guide,
and that's one of the important things for my work
that I take from Hedegar,
is this idea that the feeling of shyness
is often translated as attunement,
and the popular translation is translated as state of mind,
but it's a very terrible translation
because Hedegar wanted nothing to do with states of mind,
and so attunement might be a better word for now,
some people like to use this position,
but it's really just the way you find yourself in the world,
how are you attuned to the world,
and it has connotations of feelings and emotions
and that sort of thing,
and so that's just one of many apriori structures
that Hedegar's gonna talk about being in time.
And how does, okay, so first question is,
we talk about Hedegar's idea that we are being in the world,
and he's trying to make the statement that,
in fact, before we even think of states of mind,
our conscious experience,
there are all these other structures
that presuppose all of that,
for us to even ask that question,
what is existence, what is consciousness,
there are many other things that come before that,
and is that what he kind of means by,
we are, obviously, we're embodied beings,
but we're also in the world amongst other beings.
Yes, so being in the world, and it's all hyphenated,
so if somebody's listening and they haven't seen
the phrase written out in his book,
being hyphened in hyphened the hyphenate world is one,
and it's done that way because what Hedegar's trying
to signify with that is a unitary phenomenon,
he's trying to say, all of this comes together,
it's all codependent, it's an interdependent phenomenon.
We don't first exist in a try to find the world,
and our world doesn't first exist,
and then we kind of come into it,
but there's a interdependence and kind of co-manifestation
of existence and what he means by world,
and that's what being in the world is,
and so it's a holistic and interdependent sort of thing.
So if you look at how that pertains to meaning,
firstly, this is something I've struggled with.
For Hedegar, it seems like there's a world of facts,
but for the world to become true,
for those facts to have a truthfulness,
it requires a Dasein or a human being,
Dasein is the term he uses.
So then would he say that in some sense,
reality truly became reality as we know it now,
only after we came into being, we came to exist,
and we were being in the world?
Or is that something he doesn't really talk about too much?
So he doesn't talk about it a whole lot.
There are some very, very difficult passages
that are still disputed today,
and that I've had a lot of fun conversations
about these passages because they are very difficult
to try to discern what the heck he was meaning.
He also uses the word world,
and it's three or four different ways in being in time,
but he's very precise about when he uses them,
and he even tells you beforehand,
like if it's in quotes, this is what it means.
If it's capitalized, this is what it means.
So he has a good system.
He's not just erratic in throwing these words out there.
He knows what he means by them,
and he tries to convey to us what he's meaning by them.
But to get back to your question,
yeah, in a very real way, what Heidegger is saying
is reality as we know it,
the world as we experience it,
the world as we articulate it,
whether that's in, you know, has facts or not,
only has been, it only is when Dazan is.
And the question arises, well,
if all human existence was to kind of fade out overnight,
would the world disappear,
or would there still be the world,
or would there still be entities?
That sort of thing, and Heidegger stays true
to the phenomenological approach here,
and he stays true to it in some other areas as well.
And what I mean by that is,
he doesn't give a definitive answer.
He kind of just says, well, if we're not here,
we don't really know what would be here.
Yeah, so because phenomenology is looking to experience,
he can't make a phenomenological judgment about that.
And he is honest about that.
And then something that I appreciate about his approach
is that he doesn't overstep the limits of the method
that he's using.
And I mean, philosophy has argued about that forever,
whether the world exists independently or not.
And what Heidegger just says as well,
as far as our experience goes,
and as far as the way we articulate the meaning of being,
being only is while we are.
And it's obscure and it's sometimes frustrating
if you want a concrete answer as to the independence
or not of the world.
But he just kind of then follows up by saying,
well, if we're not here, we're not really gonna know.
And I don't think anybody's had an experience
absent the world.
And so I don't think anybody knows
what the answer to that is.
And so it's a, to me, okay, so to me,
I appreciate the enigma, I appreciate the mystery behind it
because if we truly can't know,
maybe we can think through it and have a discourse about it
and it might be a very meaningful sort of thing
to talk about, but because we can't know,
we shouldn't pretend that we know.
Yeah, or, I mean, perhaps it even,
in some sense, Hattaker probably wouldn't even like us
just talking too abstractly about such things,
given that again, like you said,
he would want us to stick to the phenomenological approach
where we're talking about structures of experience.
And for starters, if there aren't any structures,
there are some conversations we can't have
whereas at one point it just becomes the term you use,
which I know is by Wittgenstein's language games.
At one point, you know, which is why sometimes I think
of like all these pop philosophy or pop science ideas,
like the many worlds theory or brain in a bat or what else?
Do we live in a matrix?
They really seem like futile or even useless efforts
or conversations to have because again,
it doesn't pertain to our palpable actual experience.
It's just fully abstract.
And again, nothing wrong with abstracts.
Mathematics is fully abstract,
but look at how useful mathematics is.
But I'll get your point.
I think you explained it quite well.
So Hattaker's idea of being in the world,
how does that relate to what you discussed here?
Firstly, meaning and then well,
perhaps more, more specifically, human meaning.
Sure.
Yeah, and so, and I will also clarify
since you added that caveat on at the end there,
I really only talk about meaning in relation to,
as it pertains to humans, meaning in the lives of humans.
I don't know if I'll ever transcend that
and talk about meaning as such,
but again, that's not a phenomenologically appropriate topic
because I don't know, outside of my human experience,
I don't know what meaning might be.
But so being in the world,
I think it kind of at least starts to give us,
well, for one, that's gonna be after our structure
to having an experience of meaning.
I mean, we're in the world not in a sort of container
like way like water is in the glass,
but we're the world and us are co-constituted in a sense.
And we have to try to think about how I wanna phrase it.
I guess we have to involve ourselves in the world.
Like we are, we're always being in the world,
we're never abstracted away from the world
or else we would be, we wouldn't be living anymore,
it would be an existing being.
So it's not that we're never not being in the world,
but I think it kind of points to this idea
that us in the world are closer than we think
and we're more interconnected than we think.
And if we sort of explore with,
we sort of explore the world
and various involvements that we might have with it,
we might stumble across something
that we find extremely meaningful.
And I think that's really the only way
that we can discover meaning.
I don't think we subjectively create meaning,
but I don't think meaning is also just objectively
out there in the world.
I think it's a relational phenomenon.
So I guess that the concept of being in the world
also points to that idea that it's a interdependent
and relational sort of thing.
And we might also, in the process,
discover a lot of things that we don't like
and that we don't find meaningful
or we find the opposite there or that we find meaningless.
But I think that's also just closer
to what we find meaningful
because you don't really know until you have the experience.
You don't really know until you involve yourself
in the activity or what have you.
And so it's an experiential relational thing
and being in the world is kind of just a necessary structure
for us to be able to go out there and try to find meaning.
If we weren't being in the world, we were not existing.
That's well put.
That is well, I think you hit the nail on the head there.
So being in the world is, in fact,
what's necessary to even discover meaning.
OK, OK.
Because another thing I realized was perhaps one
of the most important things John Reiki did
to the contemporary philosophical conversation
is that he started asking the question
from meaning of life to meaning in life.
And Heidegger would probably fall on the latter camp
where what he worries about or his concerns
are meaning in life.
For him, meaning of life is one of those useless questions.
Yeah, and, you know, Heidegger uses the term meaning a lot,
but he generally, what he means by that is generally
the way in which I just used it, like the sense
that something has making sense of something.
So the German term that he uses is a lot of sin, S-I-N-N.
And it can be translated as meaning,
but it can also be translated as sense.
So Heidegger doesn't really talk about meaning in life
as much as like making sense of things in life
and making sense of the world.
And that's another reason why I thought that,
because I think Heidegger gets a lot of things right.
I think he gets a lot of things correct
with his fundamental analysis.
And it's very like the fundamental structures
that he's laying out seem,
something seems true about them.
And so because of that,
and because he doesn't really talk about meaning in life,
I thought his framework would be a really great framework
to take over and to try to talk about meaning
from within that existential framework,
because it is phenomenological.
What is an experiential sort of phenomenon, meaning is.
And so almost,
I guess taking what Heidegger has done
and adding something to it,
it's kind of what, in a sense, I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah, like all great things, isn't it?
Because Heidegger himself,
even though he was trying to subvert whole of philosophy,
he still was working off,
Aristotle or Kant or some great, great thinkers of the past.
Okay, so this, I wanna read out an excerpt from your essay.
The reason being, I think the way you've put it here
very much pertains to,
so firstly, this is about,
this is a small statement you've made
in regarding apropos time,
and you've discussed how time would differ
for a phenomenologist from, let's say, a scientist.
And then you put any written,
and you've quoted Heidegger in that statement you've made.
And I think that statement itself
is more of like a sobered example as to,
it probably answers a lot of questions
that we were discussing, for example,
the difference between phenomenology and science,
or if there is this stark difference,
and then how that relates to meaning and whatnot.
So firstly, I'll read out the statement,
and then I'll ask the question.
So here's what you've stated, Jacob.
For Martin Heidegger, past events are always projected
into the future, while also existing presently
as having been.
The future is not later than having been,
and having been is not earlier than the present.
What was having been arises simultaneously
with the present and the future,
and human being is always towards,
toward itself in anticipation of the possible ways of being.
The Heideggerian concept of time
frees the phenomenologists from thinking
of past, present, and future
as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events.
So saying that, how does a phenomenologist
or a Heideggerian view time and meaning
and how that pertains to a human being
from, let's say, an analytical philosopher or a scientist?
So a common theme in Heidegger is this idea
of primordial phenomenon and deriving.
You may have to explain that term, primordial phenomenon.
So basically, what he means by that is
the more basic, more fundamental structure,
I guess, what you could say.
And because it's a phenomenological structure,
it's gonna be an experiential thing.
And Heidegger thinks that a lot of the things
that we have theories for now,
were derived from something more basic
that we had in experience.
And time is one of them.
And so the sort of everyday notion of time that we have,
which I think at the end of that paragraph
that you read, kind of talked about it
as far as like the sequentially ordered groupings of events.
So the idea that there's a future moment,
this past that's coming into the present
and then it's going to vanish into the past
and be gone forever.
So that's sort of everyday thinking about time
and clock time.
Heidegger's gonna refer to as bolder time.
It's a derived motive.
It's a derived motive time.
It's not the primordial phenomenon of time.
And so he's gonna talk about this more basic idea of time.
And he's gonna call it temporality talk.
If I say time, think about,
let's think about our everyday understanding of time.
And if I say we can't think about Heidegger's idea of time,
it might just be easier for a sake of conversation.
So temporality is obviously very important.
He wrote a book called Being and Time.
And so the second division of being and time
really dives into the details of that.
I'm not going to take your and pretend that I could,
that I know the exact meaning that Heidegger meant
with his concept of time or temporality
because it's very complex, very difficult.
But what I can say is that the basic abstract,
the basic abstractural structures
that he lays out in his existential analysis,
each pertain to a specific aspect of temporality.
So we have understanding as a a priori structure
along with attunement,
which I talked about a few moments ago.
And he also has fallenness or discourse.
And basically what Heidegger says
is that those three things come together
to form the structure of disclosiveness,
the way we disclose the world in a basic way.
And each one of those pertains
to a certain aspect of time.
And so we have, we're kind of thrown in the world,
we kind of find ourselves in the world
and we have a past that we didn't really choose for ourselves.
And we have the way we find ourselves in the world
with Inletchkite or attunement,
kind of the way we're currently attuned
and dealing with the world.
And that's kind of going to point toward the present
and then understanding is pointing towards the future
because understanding, and this is not going to be,
it's not a cognitive thing.
I mean, Heidegger will say that
because theories of cognition are going to come after this.
So again, we're talking about the a priori structures
that are required for him to be able to make up
a theory of cognition.
And so he doesn't want to,
he doesn't want people to conflate
what he means by understanding.
And he gives very specific definitions
to all of his terms and sometimes it's confusing
because we all think we know what we mean by understanding.
So if I could choose that.
But through the structure and through understanding,
we find ourselves amongst a whole lot of possibilities
and we're constantly projecting ourselves
toward those possibilities,
whether we know it or not, whether we're aware of it or not.
And it could be mundane things such as,
as if I stand up right now
and I go to walk to fill my water,
I'm going to be using the door handle
and I'm going to be doing a whole lot of things
that I'm not really thinking about doing.
But those are all possible modes of comportment,
possible ways that I can comport myself right now.
So I'm constantly projecting myself into the future.
Now to give like, try to try to give a better example
of these three modes comes together.
Maybe we could talk about the artist.
Yeah, I was just gonna ask.
So the three modes, okay, let's,
how about we try to use the example of the artist
to expound on what temporality is
and expound on what hiding means by time,
but then maybe break down those three modes.
Apropos the example of the artist.
So let's assume that we're talking about
I'll call them a master artist,
somebody that's practiced for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years,
something they've been doing their whole life.
They've built up certain habits, right?
I mean, you don't get good at something,
you don't learn how to paint,
you don't paint your master,
first time you spent decades of time
practicing, making mistakes and so on.
During the time that you're practicing something
and you're trying to master something,
you're doing that, I mean, so let's say somebody's
practicing right now, they're practicing their skill
in some art painting.
And in a very real sense, the future is co-arising.
And the way in which it's co-arising is
they are cultivating an ability to do something.
They're expanding the horizon of possibilities
that they can project themselves upon.
So through the present moment, the future is co-arising.
And let's say after they move in,
they practice, now they're the master painter
and they're creating a masterpiece.
In a very real way, their past is co-arising with them
at that moment in the sense that they have these techniques
and they have a habitual way in which they use the brush
to stroke the canvas.
And they wouldn't have that without their past practice
and discipline.
And so the past is with them at every moment,
that's with us at every moment, in the present moment.
And then their future continues to co-arise
because they're one brush stroke, two brush strokes,
it's not their masterpiece yet.
But in the process, the future,
which will be their masterpiece is co-arising,
being made possible through what they're doing right now
and what they're doing right now was only made possible
because of the past, which I'm saying the past,
but I'm also saying it's still with them
because it must be or else they wouldn't be a master.
You can't be a master at something unless you have
gathered up with you,
years and years of practice.
You're bringing all of this together in the present moment.
Which is why you say that it's not,
in fact, let me read out a small excerpt here.
You say that, during meaningful experience,
this Hedigerian temporality displaces the vulgar understanding
of time for the latter looses its significance
when human being is immersed in the world
through passionate, skilled and creative activity
or during being with others.
So the point is, to put it very, very colloquially,
you say, I'm in love with a beautiful woman
or when I'm in this, let's say flow state or whatever,
you lose track of time, I don't know where time goes.
And this is the kind of time that you're saying
Hediger is talking about, not time in a linear sense
where it's T equals zero and then it goes on from there.
And it's hard for us because what's interesting
about what I realized about Hediger is that
once you get it, you get it.
You're like, oh, it's obvious what he's talking about
because it's a part of our experience, isn't it?
But getting it is a hard part because we are so,
we are so trained or we're so,
let's say attuned to thinking a different way.
So, hmm.
Yeah, I think that's the beautiful thing
about good phenomenology is that when you get it,
you get it in a different way than you get
a proposition that you're struggling with.
Maybe you're struggling with this analytic proposition
or this argument and eventually maybe you work it off,
you get it, you understand it, and you're like,
okay, cool, I get it.
But with phenomenology, I mean,
a lot of times you do have to struggle with it.
You have to struggle with Hediger.
I struggled with him for a very, very long time
before I understood anything.
But once you get it, like you said,
because it is a part of our experience,
you're not just affected cognitively or intellectually
by your, the understanding is deeper than that,
the understanding, I mean, it feeds back
into Hediger's basic structure that he's talking about.
I mean, you feel it, you feel attuned to it.
You say, oh my goodness, I can see this in my experience.
How did I not notice this before?
Because again, he's pointing,
he's trying to point to things in experience
and there's something very powerful about that,
in my opinion, over and above something
that's just propositional that you can't experience
for yourself or you can't notice or reflect on
and say, yes, that is a part of the experience.
And it's not surprising that the existentialist,
Sartre, Dibabwa, Kamu,
were all heavily influenced by Hediger
because they were, that was the question,
they too were trying to deal with,
the philosophy they were trying to develop,
was it was, well, the word itself is existential.
There probably isn't any other word to describe it.
Fantastic, that was a great explanation,
especially the, I like the analogy of the artist.
In fact, all great, great Hedigerian teachers
or teachers who do teach Hediger,
they, like the person that comes from my mind
is one of my intellectual heroes, Hubert Dreyfus.
It's how beautifully he,
he first of all, he's thinking live,
he's thinking out loud,
but also he always tries to connect it to a phenomena,
to a phenomenon,
something that's palpable in our lives.
How are we going with time, Jacob?
We're about an hour, 20 minutes into the podcast,
into the episode.
Can we do a few more minutes?
So how are you going with time?
I'm good on time.
Either talking to you today,
or I'm reading and working on the dissertation.
So I have, as long as you want.
Perfect, I appreciate that, man.
I mean, look, I was thinking,
as we did discuss before we started recording,
I don't think we can go to all the questions,
everything you've written,
especially probably the paper I like the most by you,
the reinstatement of existential meaning
or passion as a disclosure of meaningfulness in life.
That seems a very,
perhaps a very contemporary topic to even talk about,
because passion seems to be something we talk about a lot
in our culture these days.
It'd be interesting to think of that
in a phenomenological approach.
However, saying all that,
I would probably leave that to a whole other episode.
So let's get to the one that you said
is a good starting point to your work,
which is your paper,
Ontology of Meaning.
So a lot of questions that I've written down on this.
We touched on a lot of things.
We spoke about phenomenology for sure.
How about we talk about something a bit interesting?
Firstly, like we did with the previous paper,
let's just get what you were trying to convey in the paper.
So what did you mean by Ontology of Meaning?
And after that, I want to talk about authenticity,
because it seems like this idea of,
just like there's this cliche corporate words,
like bring your authentic self to work
or be authentic online.
And it's perhaps worth diving into what is authenticity
from more of a existential phenomenological approach.
But sorry, I'm getting carried away here.
Before we get there,
your paper, Ontology of Meaning,
what's the paper about?
What were you trying to convey?
And also if you could please,
where can people find the paper,
either now or in the future?
Sure, so that paper will be available
in the first quarter of 2023.
That's what I was told the anticipated publication date is.
Basically, they just have to do some formatting
and just wait for the next issue to be published.
And it should be out there
at the Conan Post Journal of Philosophy.
So in that paper, it's very apparent.
I think, is it in the title, Ontology of Meaning?
I've read that paper so long,
but sometimes I forget what the heck I...
I think, because the paper,
the paper, in fact,
I made a mistake when I read out the title.
The name of the file was Ontology of Meaning.
However, the title of the paper itself
is Reinstatement of Essential Meaning.
Yes, okay.
So it was originally going to be named
something about Ontology of Meaning.
I was actually playing more into the philosophical tradition
and I wanted with that
with what I was starting the kid's day in that.
And by that, I just mean,
so kind of the traditional idea of Ontology
is going to be very different
than high-finger's concept of Ontology.
And I won't go into the details of it too much,
but general in traditional philosophy,
Ontology is almost like,
you can almost take like an inventory of the world.
So you have one category,
broad category, Metaphysics.
And then a step up from that,
maybe you have Ontology,
depending on how you want to define it.
Everybody kind of seems to play with it
a little bit differently.
And in any case,
I'll just move on because I guess,
I fixed the title right before I submitted it
because I was like, man, I don't want,
you know, you start to notice your own mistakes
sometimes as they're happening.
So you're saying that you don't prefer
using the term Ontology
because you don't want to mislead the reader
as to what high digger means by Ontology.
Is that why you wanted to change the name of the paper?
Yeah, that's ultimately why I did end up changing because,
well, and also because I was kind of thinking about it
in a more traditional sense,
almost like meaning was a specific type of thing,
but it's not a thing, like meaning is not a thing.
Absolutely.
Giving that, I was kind of implying that with the title
as far as the traditional understanding of Ontology goes.
And I really did not want to give that impression
or implication that I was trying to call out meaning
as a thing or an entity.
Because I most certainly, I most certainly do not think that,
but in any case, then that paper, I was really,
I was trying to get across
and how we might be able to begin thinking about meaning
and more importantly,
where we, well, I guess less about where we might experience it
and more, yeah, and more about how we should be thinking
about meaning if we want to actually talk about it
in a genuine manner.
And I say this because, and I go,
I guess I'm pretty sure that's the essay
where I talk a bit about science
and talk a bit about logic.
And I try to, I mean, it's really quick.
I didn't have a lot of space to do this,
but I try to point out the reasons why
are the wrong frameworks
where we're trying to discover meaning
and talk about meaning and why I did this.
Specifically with scientism,
but with really any reductive,
you have this idea that everything can be reduced
down to a certain thing.
So like we can reproduce things,
a physical substance, things that chemistry
or we can reduce things to our biology.
And you pair that reductive approach with scientism
or the idea that we're gonna just place
in physics or chemistry or biology,
you're gonna, there's no word meaning anymore
in that world, and meaning is considered non-existent.
It's considered unreal, it's considered
at best an illusion or some subjective manifestation
made up by our mind as opposed to a real phenomenon.
And so that paper was really trying to,
get that idea across and to try to point
to phenomenology as a legitimate outside logic in science
for understanding the world.
And I argued for
sole phenomenology, like only phenomenology approach,
but phenomenology and these other things
because if ultimately I think
a holistic approach is the best approach
if you want to understand as much as you can.
And so by placing phenomenology aside,
things like science and logic as tools
for understanding ourselves in the world and reality
and by saying ourselves world reality
really just mean everything.
I just mean everything, our experience,
the world, the cosmos, you know.
All of being.
Yeah, all of being.
You know, this is, I'm glad we're talking about this.
Perhaps before we get to the, sorry,
did I interrupt you, Jacob?
I think you were not done.
Were you done?
No.
Apologies if I did.
Sometimes the connection, there's a bit of a lag.
Okay, so this is interesting because you've said here,
I wanted to ask from you,
and this is very, very important, I think,
because now, again, going back to a point I made before,
it seems like science has taken the place of philosophy.
And I think that's to our own peril.
And you've said here, science is reductive.
So it attempts to describe meaning, experience,
whatever in a reductive sense.
And then you've said it's trying to take a view from nowhere.
However, this got me thinking,
you made a really interesting point
in your previous article that we discussed.
And I'm going to read out an excerpt where you've said it,
you put it this way, you've said,
so this is, I propose this idea of science
trying to be objective and taking a view from nowhere.
You've commented on something by Ponty,
by Molluponty, where you put differently.
And as Maurice Molluponty made explicit
in his preface to Phenomenology of Perception,
this is really important what you've said here.
The third-person perspective of science
is only made possible through first-person human experience
because we only achieve a third-person perspective
via a collection of first-person human experiences.
The subjective first-person experience then
is something that is both pervasive and inescapable.
So this got me thinking,
is it even possible for science to ever be objective?
Can we have an objective science
in the sense of can we truly,
given that we are designed, we are being in the world,
have a view from nowhere?
Oh, no, I think it's a myth.
I think at best, we can have intersubjective knowledge.
And I think that's what most people,
not that they mean, not that they know that they mean this,
but when most people say objective knowledge,
what they're pointing to is intersubjective knowledge.
Because, yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any way
to get around what Molluponty pointed out
in the preface to his book.
There's no way of getting out of it.
There's no way of getting around it.
That's all we have.
And so, if we're gonna collect up
a bunch of subjective experiences
and call them objective,
what we're really pointing to is intersubjectivity.
So a scientist would probably try to challenge you
on that point, on account of that point, saying that,
oh, no, in the scientific approach,
we have the double-blind study,
or we have rigorous empirical research
where when you present a paper,
or when you have a hypothesis,
it's picked on by many other individuals,
many other, well, not individuals, let's say experts,
in that field who try and break down your arguments,
break down what one has asserted.
And then why are this excavation,
why are this breaking down or destructuring of a hypothesis,
if that proves the falsity or the truthfulness
of a certain hypothesis?
And as scientists would try to counter you saying that,
eventually, as we keep doing this,
we get to this to put it plainly, view from nowhere
or an objective approach.
So how would you respond to that?
I would, I guess I would respond by asking,
maybe a little bit of information about each of the experts
in the field that was trying to check over the work
and get into, you know, and see if it works or not.
Because I think by doing that,
very quickly you get to the idea that another person,
this is another design that has a perspective on the world.
And so we're collecting his perspective
and we're collecting the next expert's perspective on this.
And, you know, I guess I would conclude by asking where is,
because if there is a view, it's a view from somewhere.
A view implies where you can't view something
without a view or to have a perception there's got,
there must be something perceiving.
And so I think to further imply perspectives.
And so I think it's not,
I mean, I'm just objectivity.
I know some people are opposed here
and they want something more objective,
but I just, there's no reason to believe
that there's anything as such
because everybody who has ever said that
is saying that from their given perspective.
And so it's almost like a performative contradiction
in a sense.
If you're going to argue for a view from,
can actually show the view from nowhere.
And if you, to have a view is to be a,
to experience something is to be an experience or,
then I think it's just, you get,
and so I guess, yeah, I guess that's,
I would just try to respond in that way.
And then if they can bat and push back them.
I'm not much of an arguer.
I don't like arguments and things.
A fair enough, but I tend to be quite,
you and I probably are a bit different on that
because I tend to be quite confrontational with these things.
Yeah, because it is interesting
because I even at like leaving,
maybe at a bit of a higher, more like a cultural level,
we have a lot of these things,
even in politics or whatever people say.
I speak the truth, unbiased facts.
I throw facts at you or what's this
by the Ben Shapiro guy facts,
don't care about your feelings, all these such things.
But it seems like people don't even question the words
they use as in what do you mean by facts?
What do you mean by truth?
And it even gets the idea of,
what can't try to describe in his critic of pure reason,
there's pneumonia and phenomena.
And there are certain things that we can never experience.
They are more like upper high concepts.
And it does, but then, I don't know,
but then I wonder if like a Heidi Gehran would ask,
oh, in fact, no, the pneumonia itself doesn't exist
without someone being able to view it or perceive it.
Yeah, so that's a good question.
Yeah, I think, so for Heidi Gehran,
there's no two-world model.
I guess I always refer to like some distinction there,
two-world model, because you have like,
yeah, things and they appear a certain way,
but then you also have these things behind them
and that's like something else.
And you can't get to that.
You can't get to that.
So I refer to it as two-world model
because you have the appearances that you can get to
and you have this hidden world that you can't get to.
Yeah.
And Heidi Gehran has the single-world model.
Yeah, he was very much opposed to the Cartesian approach
in that sense, wasn't it?
Okay, here's an interesting one.
You've spoken about authenticity
and your paper, Ontology of Meaning,
oh, sorry, not Ontology of Meaning,
you've spoken about authenticity.
You've spoken about authenticity in the paper,
the reinstatement of Extensual Meaning.
I know I read that out a couple of times,
it's just to clarify what we're referring to.
So when it comes to the topic of authenticity,
it's something we hear very much in,
it's quite pervasive.
We hear it quite a lot in the contemporary online conversations.
As I said, a lot of corporations talk about
bring your authentic self to work.
For a Heidi Gehran or a phenomenologist,
what is authenticity?
And perhaps more importantly,
how is there a distinction between,
let's say Saad's view of authenticity
to what Heidi Gehran talks about?
That is if there is a difference at all.
So Heidi Gehran's understanding of authenticity
is going to be related to, we talk very minimally,
but I guess maybe we talked about possibilities
and we're always projecting ourselves on possibilities.
And so Heidi Gehran thinks that,
okay, so let's talk about inauthenticity first
because it'll be easier to get to authenticity
because Heidi Gehran thinks that we're all,
all of us are most of the time living
in an inauthentic manner.
Now, Heidi Gehran doesn't place any judgment
on authenticity or inauthenticity.
He's just kind of saying like,
this is the way I'm describing things
from this phenomenological approach.
So he's not saying that one's good or bad necessarily,
but of course we all have connotations
associated with those terms.
So by living inauthentically,
basically what Heidi Gehran's talking about
is where we're in a fallen mode of being.
And that's always a possibility for us.
And really what that just means is we're absorbed
in das man, which can be translated as the anyone
or the ze.
And that's just, it could be anyone.
It's kind of like group thought.
You can think about it as like group thought
or group thinking is kind of the way.
So if you come across phrases like,
this is what one does in this formal setting.
Like that's another, you know,
if you hear that, everybody comes into that at some point
whether you know, whether you're going to school
or you're going to a restaurant,
there's like, you behave in certain ways
and you don't behave in other ways.
And most of the time, I mean, a lot of times that's good.
I mean, we have to have these cultural structures in place
or else things would just be chaotic and hectic
and nobody would get along at all.
And everything would be in this.
So it's a lot of the time, it's not bad to be inauthentic.
But if you're just always inauthentic,
then what you do and the possibilities
that you project yourself upon
and the understanding that you have
of yourself in the world is given over to you
from the day, from the group thought.
You're not taking anything up as your own.
You're not reflecting on things from your own experience.
You're accepting what they say
and you're doing as they do.
And if you're doing as they do
and you're accepting what they say,
that's why it's called sometimes translated as the anyone
because it could be anyone, you could be anyone.
I mean, you are anyone at that point.
There's really no individuation between you and someone else
if you're both functioning in that sort of mode all the time.
And so that's just, I guess a very crude way
to describe inauthenticity.
And so to project yourself authentically
to, I guess, even become aware of your authentic possibilities,
you have to, in a sense, distance yourself
from the world of the day, from the anyone.
You have to sort of quiet the group thought
in the group chatter
and the High Digger says that,
he says one way of doing that is by,
is through, I mean, actually it's,
so this is where his concept of angst and anxiety
comes into play because he says,
during these experiences of intense angst and anxiety,
in anxiety, you almost come into contact
with and experience nothingness in a sense.
And this is more akin to, I think,
maybe what we would call it in contemporary,
like severe depression rather than just anxiety.
And so if you think about the severely depressed,
they're almost in a sense living in a different world
in the sense that they're not making connections
in practical references as they would in their everyday life.
Like things don't necessarily,
things kind of like start, they begin to fail to make sense.
And it's difficult for you to do very basic practical
everyday things if you're severely depressed.
And somebody, anybody who's had these experiences
who probably relate,
I've had these experiences throughout my life.
And the reason why this is,
why this might get you toward authenticity is because
during those experiences, the world is quiet
in the sense that you're not just running
from one thing to the next into the next
as the public interpretation would have it.
Or you're not just doing as one does,
you're probably just sitting in a room by yourself
and not knowing what to do or what to think.
And so that's one way that Heidegger will say,
you can distance yourself from public opinion
and public chatter and public interpretation
and understanding if you experience this.
And I guess on the other, the next step of that is
realizing or coming to terms with your own death
and kind of reflecting upon your own death
because Heidegger says that that's the only truly,
that's the only truly self-owned possibility
in the sense that it's your possibility
and it's no one else, it's nobody can die for you.
I mean, if they die, you don't die,
so they're technically not dying for you.
Nobody can take over your death.
When you die, it's your, you have to die the death
or you're not dead.
And Heidegger talks about this as the,
he talks about death as the impossibility
or the possibility of the impossibility of existence.
Again, because he's staying true
to the phenomenological methods of the possibility
of the impossibility of existence
because Heidegger is not gonna say
what he thinks happens after death
because he hasn't experienced it
and it's not a phenomenological thing to talk about.
And so he says that it's possible that when we die,
maybe we won't exist and that's kind of where he leaves it.
But by coming to terms with this
and the way that Heidegger describes
which is essentially, it's my death, it's my own
and it's nobody else's death.
That's the first glimpse of what he's going to say,
what he's gonna term authenticity
because it's my own possibility.
Okay, well, this is my own possibility.
Maybe I have other possibilities that are my own,
not anybody else's.
Maybe what might those possibilities be?
And then maybe you can start to think about
how you want to live your life
rather than how they want you to live your life.
And you can begin to construct in existence
the way that you would like
as opposed to the way that they would like.
And through doing that,
you begin to reveal authentic possibilities for yourself.
They can project yourself upon
whether it's taking up a certain discipline
or for me it was doing philosophy.
I actually started my formal education
in a different field and really loved philosophy
but everybody said that's what I should not be doing
in a formal setting.
I should get educated so I can make money.
And so, and I did listen to what they said
for a very long time and then eventually I said,
you know what, I'm just gonna do this.
I can't stop reading this.
I can't stop thinking about this.
I'm obsessed with philosophy.
I don't know if I can force myself to go to school
for anything else, so I'm just gonna do it, you know?
And so, I guess I like using that example
because it was very obvious to me that I was being
directed by popular opinion
and what they think I should be doing.
And then when I took over my existence as my own
and what not, then I started to reveal
these authentic possibilities for my existence.
And so really what authenticity for Heidegger means
is importing yourself in a way that is unique
to your own existence and in such a way
that you've chosen those possibilities.
You've taken them over as you're on your pick
and so responsibility comes in here
because if you're just doing whatever you want on a whim,
that's not a very great way to live either.
You might think you're being authentic,
but you really don't have a self at that point.
I mean, you're not cultivating anything in any real sense
and so maybe you're doing what you want to do
but you're not manifesting an authentic self
in the way that Heidegger would say
that you need to appear if you're gonna be authentic.
However, does Heidegger place any moral judgments
on the concept of authenticity itself
for a Dasein or a human being?
In contrast, so let's say someone like Sarth
who does seem to, he calls it bad faith to be inauthentic,
who does seem to play some kind of moral judgment
despite him not being a fan of moralism
into authentic experience.
And I guess I'm trying to ask is there even a difference
between Heidegger's version
and Sarth's version of authenticity?
I'm not incredibly familiar with Sarth's version.
I feel like if I don't wanna say anything that,
yeah, I guess I wanna refrain from commenting
because I don't know enough to say
whether or not they could basically be considered the same.
The only thing that I will say is that
I know Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on a few things
and one of those things was the way in which Heidegger
was using the term existential
and if we're talking about existential possibilities
and how important existential possibilities are
for Heidegger's idea of authenticity
and if Sarth did misinterpret Heidegger on that point
then I would think there would be a difference
and maybe an important distinction
to make between the two concepts of authenticity
but I don't know for certain.
But does Heidegger himself place
any kind of qualitative differences?
I don't wanna use the word moral.
Let's say qualitative differences
between being authentic and inauthentic.
No, he doesn't and I think the reason is because we,
even if we're aware of our possibility for authenticity
and even if we're living an authentic life most of the time,
we're still participating in cultural structures
that would be considered inauthentic
by Heidegger's thought on pretty much an everyday basis
and it's not a bad thing to be doing.
It's necessary.
We're taught when we're children to look both ways
when we cross the road.
It's what one does before they cross the road.
So even these very mundane things
that you wouldn't really think about
in this philosophical capacity
would be lumped into this idea of things,
this all-term inauthenticity this way,
things that we've taken over from history and culture
and society as far as ways to act
and ways to think about things.
And it's not a bad thing.
I mean, I think we should also look both ways
before we cross the road.
Yeah, that's what's prescribed.
Yeah, another great example are Hubert Raphis.
I believe it's Hubert Raphis.
Pretty sure it's him.
He uses on the phenomenon is when you get into an elevator,
the distance you stand from other people
and he says that that can culturally differ in fact.
So when you get into an elevator,
some people don't mind being able to close to each other
whereas perhaps in Western countries
we would prefer having a better space
and we wouldn't want to be too close to another person
whereas I remember growing up in Sri Lanka,
if you even take public transport,
the other guy is just breathing down your neck
right next to you.
You wouldn't even see that here in Australia for instance.
Yeah, so again, those just because we're a part
of certain kinds of cultural practices does not make,
that is yes inauthentic,
but I wouldn't say that makes you a morally inferior person
or well, he doesn't make moral claims for status
but he wouldn't even try to place any kind
of qualitative judgment on it, doesn't he?
Yeah, yeah, so sometimes there's,
I mean, the terms are so,
they're translated as authenticity and authenticity so much
that I think it would be difficult to get away
from that particular translation of them,
but another possible translation of the term
that uses in German for authenticity,
I mean, you could translate it as own-ed-ness
or so it could be like something that you chose
like in a self-owned manner or something like that.
And so like inauthenticity, you know,
might be just, it's a thing that you're doing
that you didn't really, you weren't the original agent
to prescribe that or something, you know?
I mean, it's kind of difficult to talk about without just
using the terms that are always used in the translations,
but I feel like in the original language,
it wouldn't have such heavy connotations as it does
in Western culture, as far as like acting authentically
as something you must do all the time
and you must always avoid it, you know?
And the problem is again with authenticity or even passion,
which we can get to hopefully in the next conversation,
Chekhov, is that it's a colloquialism.
It's used so, it's pervasive colloquially
and it comes with a lot of baggage.
So it's a bit hard to, here's where I really wish
that I learned, I could speak German.
In fact, I'm trying to learn French
to read some of the French philosophers,
but maybe one day in life, who knows?
Maybe even German.
Yeah, mate, so look, that was fantastic.
I am really feeling refreshed
and I would even say to a certain extent,
I think I'm in the flow state right now.
So I'm just really, really feeling it.
I don't think we'll have time to go through your other paper
and in fact, just to give it the time that it deserves,
I wanna probably have a separate episode on that.
We're coming to the two hour mark
or we've even crossed two hours now.
Maybe to kind of, as like a conclusive statement,
more of just practical advice.
As someone who studies philosophy, as a writer,
I would ask you a two-part question.
What advice would you have for people like myself,
neophytes, or even just people trying to get into philosophy
on how to study philosophy?
And secondly, what advice would you have
on writing philosophy?
So as far as studying philosophy goes,
it's always a good idea to have an understanding
of the history of philosophy.
That way, you kind of, so getting an idea of the history,
you, if you reflect on that sort of study,
you start to come to certain realizations
as far as maybe how one idea inspired another idea
and you also get an idea of what's been said already.
So, okay, so when you get into philosophy,
sometimes it happens where you think you have
a really cool novel idea based on something you've read,
but then you realize that somebody else also said that
5,000 years ago, it's a thing of the history.
It's good for that reason too.
So you're not just spending time reiterating something
that somebody's already done 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.
It also gives you an idea that nothing is absolute
in the sense that you can see how much has changed
over the centuries of philosophical thought.
And I think that's good for the ego
just to get an understanding that,
they didn't have the absolute truth.
I'm not gonna get the absolute truth,
but we can think about these things
and still maybe discern partial truths
or something like that.
I always like to have that in mind
when I'm writing things or thinking about things.
So any more, when it comes to your process of reading,
writing, how does it look like on a day-to-day basis?
Consistency is, I think, what has helped me above all else.
Like just reading a little bit every day
or studying a little bit every day when you can't,
like even if it's 20 minutes.
So a lot of times the first thing I do in the morning
is I listen to a lecture
or I listen to part of an audio book or a podcast
where they're discussing certain things.
Because that just really gets my mind going right away
as far as thinking about these things.
And the reason why I choose, sometimes I'm too tired,
like for the first hour that I wake up
that I can't really force myself to read,
but I can listen to something and get my coffee.
Yeah, I can listen and drink coffee.
It's hard for me to read and make my coffee.
So I think repetition or consistency
and just persevering,
like if you think you don't understand some of the things,
like don't just stop reading it, just read it.
Even if you don't understand it, just read it
because you might start to understand
bits of it after you're finished.
And even if you don't,
things might start to make sense maybe months later
or something like that.
That's the experience I had
with high degree of being in time.
I read it once and came away from it saying,
dude, I don't understand literally anything this guy said.
But I feel like there's something really important here.
And so I really dove into secondary sources and lectures
and going through the book multiple times after that.
And so I would say just read a little bit every day
and make notes right in the margins of your book.
If you have a physical book,
don't try to keep your book super perfect and neat.
Just start writing stuff down and highlighting stuff.
If you have a question about something you read
and it seems like it's a good question,
write the question next to the paragraph in the book.
You know, just doing small things like that
has helped me a whole lot.
Highlighting things you think are important.
And then highlighting things in a different color
that you just don't understand.
You know, because you can go back through
and you can, it has to be an active process, I guess.
Maybe that's what I'm trying to get around to.
It involves an active process.
You're not just sitting there and taking in words
that you're seeing with your eyes.
It's an involved process of writing and thinking
and reflecting and don't be concerned
with reading too quickly or saying,
it's taking me forever to get to the 10 pages,
but it's gonna take me a year to read being in time.
Just give it the time.
It will be quicker and easier to read.
And I just like to take the approach
of giving things the time that they ask.
They're gonna ask you for a certain amount of time
and just give it to them.
So do you normally pick a thinker
and then study all of that thinker's work,
the whole over of the thinker's work?
Or do you rather pick,
let's say a fundamental philosophical text,
like it could be critique of pure reason
or some of Plato's Republic, whatever it may be,
and then focus on the text itself?
Or are you more thinker focused?
So really, I'm more thinker focused now
than I have ever been, but previous to this,
I almost always say I was thinking just broadly.
Let's just say I was thinking about topics
and philosophy of mine.
And maybe I got intrigued by physicalism.
Well, then I would go through and I would try to find
what the history of physicalism was
and what the major thinkers were in kind of read along
the concept or the theory from a variety of perspectives.
And then I really immersed myself in it
and try to like think from that perspective.
And sometimes you do have to spend a lot of time
to like get to use that idea in turn
to get a tune to that kind of motive fit thought.
So they get to spend more time,
but then after that, I would read the opposite view,
whatever the opposite view was,
not necessarily just arguments against
whatever position it is,
but what's like a contrasting theory or idea.
And then I would dive into that.
And so I did that.
Honestly, that's what most of my undergrad time doing
was just like kind of juxtaposing theories and concepts
with contrasting theories.
And just trying to get a really holistic view
of like why people think things.
I don't have very strong opinions personally.
It's easier for me to do that sort of study.
I'm just, I'm always very skeptical of everything,
but also myself at the same time and try to say,
I mean, I can appreciate ideas that maybe I disagree with.
And it'd be very difficult to say anything absolutely.
I could-
Well, it's interesting though,
like I, you know, like you hear a typical trope
by more pop public intellectuals is be skeptical,
be open-minded, be critical, be objective, be rational,
we hear all these terms thrown around quite a lot, isn't it?
But it's also sometimes I think, you know,
and again, I'm not trying to pick on a particular
public intellectual like someone like Steven Pinko
or Sam Harris who constantly to almost like ad nauseam
talk about rationality and reason
and being open-minded and whatnot.
They also don't seem to get it that in fact, firstly,
being skeptical, being critical is,
it's a really difficult thing to do.
It's in fact quite unnerving.
It leaves one in this state of angst
and there's no stability in one's life.
And it's, if you truly authentically do it
in a very genuine, sincere way,
it can leave one unraveled, uprooted, you know?
It's not an easy thing to do.
No wonder you see, it's like what Dostoevsky said,
it seems that men with large hearts and deep minds
seem to be the most miserable.
And I think instead of that in common punishment,
I'm paraphrasing him.
And then also comes the other thing where even these,
again, what should I call them?
New Age Atheists, not New Age Atheists,
like the New Atheists, so again, public intellectuals,
they, for me, all of their skepticism,
it's not skeptical enough.
They still very much a domain,
their own domain of reason or whatever.
It seems like they haven't explored many other areas
that probably then probably would even unravel them
because all of their work would also then deconstruct
and break down.
And it's funny, because that's when you were talking
specifically about, I know you didn't want to pick on anybody,
but when you brought up Sandhairs, you know,
I just thought, yeah, he's always talking about,
people should be skeptical,
but I don't think he's skeptical about his own thoughts at all.
But just that, yeah, it's not for,
he doesn't portray that, he doesn't give that impression.
He never, he has a question himself enough to,
for me to say, yeah, he's skeptical.
I don't think he's very skeptical at all.
Yeah, because it seems that, again,
I don't know why, I guess this is a very arbitrary,
I just picked Sam Harris,
but even Sam Harris, he has his foundational like axioms
he works of, but within those axioms,
he will question, he'll be critical,
but he never tries to break down those axioms themselves,
which I feel, which is why I admire an intellectual
like Heidegger, which is what Heidegger was trying to do.
And that's, yeah, I guess all I would say, Jacob,
especially, thanks a lot, man, I truly am grateful.
As I said, I'm a complete amateur,
so it means a lot that you shared your work with me,
even the stuff that you haven't publicly published
for me to go through and study.
I haven't read The Horde of Being in Time yet.
Slowly working my way through it,
you know, plotting along, one could say,
but it's a worthwhile journey.
It's also something I've realized, I do it now more as,
in some sense, it's like a moral responsibility
that I'm obliged to do this,
that I should make time for it.
And that means spending a lot of time in solitude,
not really getting out,
but the point I was trying to make is,
I think you're a great thinker, you're a fantastic writer.
We didn't really get much into the writing,
hopefully in the next episode,
but I can't thank you enough, Jacob, it means a lot.
You're a good bloke, and I'm looking forward to
the work you do in the future, more of what you write.
And when you do write the,
when your Being in Time comes out,
let's have another episode and talk about your magnum opus.
Sure, sure, certainly, yeah, I really appreciate it.
Thanks for having me on and chatting,
and I'll just reiterate something I said earlier,
if you guys want to read any of the papers
and I can't find them or can't get ahold of them,
feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to be over.
And again, I'm a better writer than I am a speaker,
so.
Oh, no, you did great, trust me, I am not good at neither,
so you actually just got one thing figured out the right way.
But not just Jacob, just on that note though,
you said that your website was still under construction,
so if I do leave a link to the website,
it's probably not going to load,
but is the domain going to be the same one,
or are you going to change it completely?
The domain will stay the same.
Yeah, the website is under maintenance right now,
I'm kind of revamping it to,
I'm trying to provide resources and information
about phenomenology and existentialism,
and specifically meaning and meaningfulness,
and just trying to provide a little bit of direction
for people that are looking to read more about the stuff
and study it, and yeah, so I can't say how soon it will
be finished, but I would say it's not gonna be
more than maybe three weeks or four weeks from now.
Fantastic, yeah, I'll try to get this up as soon as possible.
In any case, I shall leave a link to your Twitter account,
Twitter profile, and then if people do wanna get in touch
with you, they could contact you there, correct?
Yep, certainly, yeah, and I think,
I might even have a link to my website on,
if you don't put it on here or whatever,
people can find it, I think on my Twitter.
Perfect, thanks mate, cheers.
I shall stop recording now, take care.
