Hey, everyone, I just want to make this quick video for one of my favorite
YouTubers and people on the internet right now, CoffeeZilla, a message from a
fan. I love his work. I think he's one of the most important people on the
internet right now. He's doing true journalism, exposing these scams and
just it's to a almost bizarre and absurd level when a normal guy like me just
sees them and it's unbelievable. And I think he's in great work. He is extremely
inside, he's brilliant, he works hard and what he creates, his content is of
true value to society. I truly believe that and I'm not trying to
blow steam up your ass, I mean sincerely. However, saying all that, saying all that,
here comes the jab jab and the right hook. I do think he makes a huge mistake.
I think he gets one point room, especially when I see him on podcasts, on huge
podcasts like Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan. He portrays all these scams as being
anomalies to the current neoliberal capitalistic order. He in fact even says
that I'm a capitalism, there's really nothing wrong with capitalism, it's just
these things are the anomalies. And I think he makes a mistake there. I think
the best way to portray it is to in fact understand that these scams are built
into the, are built into capitalism itself. They're built into the antagonisms,
the deadlocks, the consumerism, the desires that capitalism creates. And these
scams aren't anomalies and they'll only keep getting worse in the current economic
system and the current ideological system we live in. So look, if he's interested
in obscure theory, I would highly recommend him read anything by Slavoj Zizek.
Essentially any of these books probably start with the plague of fantasies,
but if he really wants to get some heavy stuff, perhaps start with Karl Marx's
capital. Now, don't get me wrong, while I am an anti-capitalist, I'm not saying that
Marxism is the answer. I don't know what the answer is to be honest, but sometimes it's
not even the answers itself, but it's the questions that count. And perhaps we should
start questioning, why do these scams come up every couple of years? And why is it,
why does it seem like things are getting worse for the middle class? Why does it seem like
we're in the midst of an ecological crisis and in the midst of a mental health crisis,
in the midst of a almost existential crisis for most people, where there are terms like
debts of despair? And those questions are perhaps important asking, and maybe it is
because of our current ideological system, our current hegemonic system of capitalism,
and all these scams, they never really aren't going to go away. It doesn't matter how many
scams Coffizula exposes, as long as things remain the way they are, they'll still unfortunately
keep coming up. And in fact, probably even get worse. I do like the joke by Slavoj Žižek,
where it's this kind of naive, I'm not saying Coffizula is naive, I'm saying all of us, we're
all naive. We have this naive hope that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. And then Žižek
says, oh, that light is in fact an oncoming train. So in fact, we make structural changes. Yes, it's
important to make changes in individual action in certainly do things like what Coffizula does,
where we expose these scams, expose these frauds, and even partake in local communities and try to
not get people caught up in MLM schemes or pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes or whatnot,
and all these little games that are imbued out of capitalism. But still, we have to make a structural
critique. And I think given Coffizula is currently extremely influential, and we all know how
internet fame works, there's a rise, you've got to make good use of it, and then it goes away,
and people just kind of forget about you. But at this moment, he can't really embrace the opportunity
and use his platform to show that no, these scams aren't anomalies. They in fact are built into a
system itself. Simply, that's what I want to say. And I would highly recommend
you know, watching lectures by Žižek on this matter, or even, you know, if Žižek is a bit too,
because he comes from a very theoretical abstract angle, reading a book like Capital by Piketty.
Well, yes, Piketty for me isn't radical enough, but still, he just makes some good points as to why
we, in fact, are in deep shit. And we need to make some fundamental changes in society.
Okay, I talk too much. I shall let you go. Cheers.
