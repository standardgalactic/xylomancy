Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRL podcast and today I'll be reading out
Guiding axiom number four that I wrote for my newsletter the unhappy man
And in case you haven't been following these axioms that I've been
Animirating in the past couple episodes
Essentially, there were seven axioms. I laid down for my newsletter the unhappy man as I didn't mention before
And I realized wow by me writing and thinking clearly
These axioms that I'm laying down
Really are a framework for all of my creative work and that obviously includes this podcast and whatever
interviews scripts, I
Don't know discositions. Whatever I do it on this podcast
I'm hoping to do it why are these axioms where why this framework and I certainly don't want it to be
something that confines me or something that sort of
Let's say that that doesn't allow me to that shackles me
I'd rather hope that it's a good place to start from and then open up into somewhere because I mean
I need some kind of stable footing and that's why I thought it's it's wise and prudent
And I'm specially given my nature to get lost in
Obscure thoughts and sometimes nonsense. It's it's healthy to have some axioms
Especially at a respectful reader or a listener in this case
So axiom number four five and six I
Don't want to just do what I have been doing in the previous episodes
or the previous
Axioms that I've been reading out where I've mostly been just reading it out of the essay I've written
Rather, I want to maybe pause in the middle have a bit of commentary
Expand as you know, the good thing about a podcast is that it allows me to do that
And I think the reason for that is because I realized, you know
Laying down is axioms because I wasn't writing a lot at that time
It took me a bit of time to be about three to four months not because they're
Deep and profound or dancing in any any way that pretty in my opinion. They're pretty
Superficial not too deep thinking
however, oh
Well, the reason it took a long time is because I just had other commitments. I couldn't write that much
However, what I was trying to make was that
In those few months itself, I've been reflecting a lot on
Kind of a revelation and say that I had in the past two years or so
It wasn't a sudden thing. It wasn't one event. It was a gradual change. I had in my thinking
both
existentially theologically and
As as a result of that perhaps philosophically and these three axioms so four five six
I'm gonna cover for today and then five and six in future episodes
They're really important for me
They they are important in the sense that they they're very
Existentially put into the current place. I'm in life and
Toronto deeply read thinkers such as Shlavo Zizek, Portellik
and Nietzsche of course and recently even the theologian Peter Orleans
These thinkers have had an unbelievable impact on how I viewed everything especially Christianity given that I'm a Christian and
therefore
because in many ways my identity comes from that relationship I have with Christianity and Christ and
When my Christian beliefs are subverted I myself am subverted
So these these axioms are important for me for five and six and I hope to
Carry on this podcast in the spirit of these axioms as I've said many times before anyway
That's enough of a introduction or prelude. I shall get started today is guiding axiom number four
That's called on writing or in this case on podcasting without lies
machinations and bullshit
and of course since I didn't mention in that unnecessarily long introduction the
link to the original
Article or essay is done in the description along with the other guiding axioms too. It's infinitely easier to know of a lie
then what is true
Existentially a lie is not a mere untrue, but an utterance of non-being. I
Got this term from Paul Tillich by the way
And to be aware of non-being is more than the conceptual theoretical understanding of a philosophical concept
Once it's felt spiritually the anxiety it imbues can leave one perturbed and unhinged
Such as why Paul Tillich states
Anxiety is the existential awareness of non-being
the courage to be
page 35
The anxiety Tillich writes off is not the medicalized kind a psychiatrist would prescribe a drug to or a new age
Self-help guru would try to solve with a mindfulness course
It's inescapably a part of our being
In fact Tillich says that this anxiety is ontological as he continues on the courage to be page 36
Perhaps I should not keep reading out the page numbers because that's kind of annoying, isn't it?
I'll just say the name of the book and obviously in the original article that I linked below
You'll see all the sources and pages and whatnot
So getting back to this existential in this sentence means that it is not the abstract knowledge of non-being
Which produces anxiety, but the awareness that non-being is a part of one's own being
Anxiety is finitude
experienced as one's own finitude
This is the natural anxiety of man as man and in some way of all living beings
It is the anxiety of non-being the awareness of one's finitude as finitude so
in this play of words that Tillich is doing here what I
Understood it to be as that what we talk of anxiety angst or the idea of finitude it is
It is ontic in nature. It is the starting point. It isn't in that sense. Perhaps he gets it from psychoanalysis where
You know, I think the Freudian notion is an I mean no way unexplored in psychoanalysis, but my very superficial reading is that
But being born into this world itself is traumatic
It's trauma. We're born with trauma and and our embellishment into being is a traumatic event
Which is why, you know, it goes on to the rest of psychoanalysis
Repression whatnot hysteria
Therefore I see anxiety in the same way. I see as not to some as I see it as not something to be killed
despite
Due to our own peril in my opinion
We've overtly medicalized it, but that's a whole other topic and in fact, it's a podcast that I'm gonna do soon
I'm currently writing the script because it's a sensitive topic for many people. I want to be
punctilious and
I would say more respectful as to how I do it
Getting back to the essay
despite being encompassing non-being and the impossibility of a jettisoning existential anxiety
Lying exacerbates the looming threat of non-being and make one's
Considerative, ontic anxiety pathological. You're aware of that's actuality
That at one arbitrary point in life, everything culminates in a nothingness
Despite you not knowing what this nothing truly entails. You have intimations of its eminence and yet you can cope with death
But if you lie and deceive in your finite existence
Not only does that verge upon you insufferably
But your life becomes so agonizingly hellish that you'd wish you were dead already
This means we identify a lie or truth
best not by the cognizance of
correspondence or objective facts the way a
Theoretician or a scientist would do with a given problem
But primarily by being attentive to one's inner thoughts emotions and psychic states when answering or writing something
In that vein metaphysically speaking if the universe is made of made up of facts the trueness or falseness of a fact
Necessites a human being or a Dazine to use how to get into terminology to come to being
case in point
Martin Luther
The father of the Protestant of reformation was a little known priest in 1517
This was until he famously hammered his 95 thesis
Onto the doors of all Saints Church in the border town of Wittenberg Saxony modern-day Germany
subsequently
Storing up a storm across a whole of Europe and eventually every corner of the world
His list began the ongoing
Descension between the hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church and its opponents
Colloquially known as the Protestants and
Circularly precipitated leftism. This is the true. I believe that Martin Luther was pretty much the first leftist
I'll start that sentence from the top and
Circularly precipitated leftism
anti-statism and modernity as a whole
One could argue that many momentous historical revolutions and social movements
From the French Revolution to the civil rights movement could be pointed to this
ostensibly simple act by Luther which he intended only to start an academic debate
at the time the absolute
Theocratic
authority
The church led led to Luther's excommunication by hopefully of the 10th
And he was called to the diet of worms a formal deliberative assembly and
Demanded to recant his heretical statements over risk being burnt at the stake in his
Intransigency notwithstanding the risk of dying a brutal death. He famously responded
My conscience is captive to the word of God. Thus I cannot and will not recant
Because acting against one's conscience is neither safe nor sound
Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me
Since we live in secular times and are detached from a pre-reform society
We can't understand the significance of Luther's actions
No reading of history will help us realize the radical change. He said forth in humanity
However, we all have our own distinctive moments of here. I stand. I can do no other
Luther believed to have found metaphysical truths about being
pause
perhaps I will not
perhaps if I rewrote this I would probably have not put the word metaphysical in there because
After reading Heidegger, I'm beginning to question the whole project of metaphysics itself
So I don't know if Luther really was talking about
metaphysical truth truths in that sense
So I would just leave it as Luther believed to have found truths about being okay back to the essay
But all he had to stand by was his conscience
Not an objective theory of any kind
His only way to discern truth from untruth was solely himself
If he recanted his statements, he would be telling the greatest of lies by defining his conscience
This he couldn't live with which is why he can do no other you and I have very little in common with Luther
except for this phenomenon of being creatures with an inescapable
idiosyncratic conscience
Leaving aside of shrews metaphysics and ontology in our daily lives in certain immediate
particularities we find truths above truth
But ourselves and conceivably the largest structural whole of reality itself
So we ought to pay attention to our lives with the utmost rigor
Eli is more than asserting an unfactual statement because it's not withstanding
machinations to obfuscate and masquerade lies as truth
Even if we convince everyone to accept a lie as being true when one lies one knows and to make matters worse
We are also self-deceiving
We must stop fooling ourselves into thinking that our
Emphatical will is the will to an unprejudiced truth far from it
Kierkegaard in his oblique
Characteristic now was a philosopher who expounded best on finite man's susceptibility to self-deception
for instance, he was highly skeptical of
Aristotelian virtue ethics and moral philosophy a
Kierkegaardian would find a living man as solely a rational creature of moral reasoning to be
Unduly naive about the human capacity for radical evil
Despite at times its spuriousness and unreliability
The findings of psychoanalysis tell us that we cannot
Acontextually and abstractly follow an objective morality
Even when we think we're doing so it could be self-deception
Comprehending this datum doesn't necessarily require reading the labyrinth of existentialism and moral philosophy
Although we all ought to rather being attentive to ourselves will suffice
Recall the last time you unequivocally knew you were doing something wrong
Not new in the sense of knowing some historical fact or political theory that he would regurgitate to sound smart
But you felt a pang of profound guilt and visceral
Discuss towards yourself for a certain act amidst the moment you hated who you were and
Couldn't relieve your conscience of this psycho-spiritual distress
At such times most of us would justify our subjective shortcomings
That are supposed to be on par with our personal telos
Would conjure up any reason to tell ourselves we are not at fault
Our intent was good or there was no real harm done etc
And who could blame us?
Life is hard and occasionally perhaps always out of pure pragmatism
Similar to cypher in the matrix
We choose to live in convenient lies as
Ignorance is bliss for most of us
In many ways Nietzsche completed Kedricat's
Essentialism by hammering home the point that even our conscious decisions and social structures we're put in
For example, the revealed scientific institutions aren't oriented towards uppercase t-truth
Nietzsche writes
Even scientific inquiry itself our science indeed
What does all scientific inquiry in general mean considered as a symptom of life?
What is the point of all that science and even more serious where did it come from?
What about that is scientific scholarship perhaps only a fear and an excuse in the face of pessimism a
Delicate self-defense against the truth and speaking morally sometimes like cowardice and falsehood
Speaking un morally a clever trick. Oh Socrates Socrates was that perhaps your secret?
Oh you secretive ironess was that perhaps your ironing?
Gosh, I can never get over and and not ever fall in love with Nietzsche's prose. It's just
Bizarre, I can't believe he writes like that. So what does it mean to be an authentic and truthful writer in this utter confusion of existence?
It's someone who doesn't write bullshit
Unlike a liar who might at least have the pretense of being concerned for the truth
Harry G. Frankfurt expounds that bullshit is speech or writing by a bullshit artist without any regard for truth at all
Instead he is predominantly aiming to be solely persuasive and
Change a listener or reader without convincing someone that something is true
It's even done unconsciously at Frank as Frankfurt elucidates in his paper
Our natures are indeed elusively insubstantial
Notoriously less stable and less inherent than the natures of other things
And in so far as this is the case
sincerity itself is bullshit
Ergo, we ought to never confuse our sensible authenticity in speaking or writing as being truthful
sincerity itself could be a tool used for deception
One can never truly know if one is being truthful
Much like love truth is an article of faith
One falls into it and thereafter decides to pursue it pause just a point here when I mean one falls into it
I certainly don't mean it's a complete arbitrary chaotic random event
You know finding truth or falling in love
For both to happen to find truth and even to fall in love
I believe we have to as a subject orient ourselves towards the fall so to speak and and I'm
I'm gonna write about this in the future once we fall we have to decide to be fallen
Therefore, it's not a mere
chaotic irrational event
Completely out of our control. We we not very much are ultimately perhaps
But in many ways we do have control at least as to how we orient ourselves and as as to how we are ready
to
To find love or find truth
All right back to the essay
Essentially speaking, which is the only way one ought to speak about such matters
This is why truth is an orientation as I had said before the intent of an individual and a state of being one
Chooses to embody rather than a destination set of facts or propositions
In that sense one could make an unfactual statement due to their ignorance
But still not be a liar or bullshitter as he's still aiming at being a seeker of truth
Not withstanding his proclivity to be fallible due to the sheer fact of being human
Of course an outside observer cannot empirically verify this. It's entirely left to one's conscience
So perhaps one should be petrified of lying and striving to be an arbiter of truth
Sojournetson was right when he wrote the simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie
subjectivity is truth and
This leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay
While I'll strive for objectivity
Pause
It's I had to pause there and think because I don't even know what I mean as strive for
Objectivity what that means perhaps the more apt term is
while I'll strive for a
trans subjectivity a
Common subjectivity if that makes any sense at all because I'm coming to the belief that we have no way of knowing
What's objectively true?
It's something that just doesn't comprehend. Oh, it's not it's not something that I
Can resonate with
objective truth in that sense
All right back to the essay. I don't want to over complicate this. Just wanna at least in some sense stick to the essay
I
Start again on that. It's it's I kind of screwed up that sentence
So subjectivity is truth and this leads to one of the most contentious statements of this essay
While I strive for objectivity
I need to realize that for the type of being we are that is human and not God
Subjectivity is true in his trench and critique of German idealism and ardent emphasis on existence
To be with an inwardness
Over abstract theorizing
Yet again, it was Kerkrgaard who expounds and even introduced to the Western mind
Perhaps the notion of truth that matters above all other truths is the subjective one
So, of course appropriated this project for a secular world with this atheistic
existentialism of radical freedom
I'm more a Kerkrgaardian than a Sartreian as I'm a religious Nietzschean
That's to say God does not exist objectively, but purely subjectively and what matters is not the afterlife, but the present one
Therefore, I'll write through the lens of subjective truth and be primarily concerned with subjectivity
Kerkrgaard writes in concluding unscientific post script
Christianity protests against every form of objectivity
He desires that the subject should be infinitely concerned about himself
It is with subjectivity that Christianity is concerned
It is only in subjectively that its truth exists if it exists at all
objectively
Christianity has absolutely no existence
If the truth happens to be only in a single subject it exists in him alone and
There is greater Christian joy in heaven over this one individual
Than over universal history or the system. I like that last bit because he's
sort of
mocking Hegel there
For him God is a subject and therefore requires a subject-to-subject relation
pause I
I'm not sure if that's true
I know I thought that was a case when I wrote it, but after reading Portellic who was also influenced by Kerkrgaard
I'm not sure if Kerkrgaard believed God was just a subject or if
God transcends the object-subject binary
Telling things that certainly to be the case he believes God does transcend that binary and so do I
So I read I need to you know, take that sentence with a grain of salt because I'm not sure if that's true
I
To the essay
This is why old religious scripture discloses truth not systems to us subjects
similarly this idea could be secularly
reappropriated for our ordinary life which entails being subjective and dealing with other subjects and
Unsurprisingly when people are treated any differently it infuriates them
For instance a feminist is right to say the objectification of women is wrong
But ironically this so-called objectification is a subjective passion of let's say male chauvinism
So nonetheless, it's a subject-to-subject relation
We cannot escape subjectivity. Perhaps if I wrote purely about the objective natural sciences
This statement might not wholly apply that too is questionable since it's us who do the science
In any case since the unhappy man is about the individual. There's no decoupling or
Universalizing the human experience from it and subjectivity is what it ultimately needs to be a human being
Bhanam such as why Sartre rightly argued against Freud's empirical psychoanalysis
That attempts to schematize a human mind
By a collection of observations for Sartre the psyche is irreducible
Ergo, I am deeply skeptical of psychometrics that attempts to prescribe
Identities to individuals through its last for categorizing for example gender differences a cognitive scientist could study the qualia
qualities of the world as perceived and experienced by us of a human subject
Experiencing the color red a foodie game or Tchaikovsky's piano concerto number one opus 23 and
Analyze the subjects brainwaves heart rate facial expressions etc and convince himself
He has an empirical objective even ontological understanding of a person
But it will be a great act of self-deception and scientific malady to presume
He precisely knows what an individual or the subject he's studying in particular
Is experiencing in a way that his findings could replace the actual human being?
a
Psychometrician could categorize human beings into the taxonomy of personality traits such as the big five ad infinitum
But never settle on what the actual existence of an individual entails
Which is why those traits are an ever-growing enumeration
And of course no Shakespearean sonnet no matter how breathtakingly poetic will truly capture
What it means for you and me to fall in love
in essence
Every human being is the eternal distinction in reality because individual who has become is to be and is
Becoming will have a life. No one or thing ever will in that sense
The only variety we can be sure of is that we are all eternally lonely in this world
The
Sinequinone for writing on human experience is the epistemic humility to know
But I will invariably fail at tapping into a person's subjective truth
And we'll only be able to delineate my subjectivity at least that which is f-able
Therefore I write at the risk of being utterly nonsensical and to be an authentic writer is to accept that writing will never fully
encompass
Existence specifically that of a soul reader in that vein to write well is to know the limits of writing
