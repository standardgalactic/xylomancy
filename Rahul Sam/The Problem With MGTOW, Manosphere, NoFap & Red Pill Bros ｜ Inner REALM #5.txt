everyone welcome to yet another episode of the inner realm podcast before we
start off some housekeeping points I apologize if I'm a bit sniffly and I
cough and I do all those things with my throat you know like scratch my throat
and all that unfortunately I've got a cold I just hope that I won't be too
irritable for you the listener and if it is too bad I'll edit the whole thing
out and make it a bit more palatable the second thing is I've got to admit I've
tried recording this episode four times already yeah I've spent four different
sessions on trying to get this episode right and I don't know why but I
simply seem to not be happy with it I simply seem to not be able to convey the
points that I'm trying to convey I think partially is because even when I was
writing the script for this episode I was a bit hesitant because you know
red pill, nanosphere, MGTO doubly, NOFAP, whatever these movements or
subcultures are they tend to be rather controversial and very very political
by nature and as a result of that of course I I'm not a fan of this kind of
casual dismissiveness of you know corporate media and anyone that does
talk about these communities critically I think they've been so maligned and
miscarriage that anyone who tries to even be a bit critical of these
communities end up getting out of slack or end up you know being called a
fraud or a liar or something like that simply because I feel like people that
are part of these communities who benefited a lot including myself by the
way have become very defensive of what these communities are so when I was
trying to record the episode every single time I felt like I said something
that I shouldn't have said I felt like I'm a spoke or I said something that was
untrue so I just you know adequately I didn't feel like I could publish that
episode so I kept trying again and again hey look let's hope I get it right this
time in any case before I start off because of the as I said the nature of
the podcast I do want to make oh I want to do want to stipulate the whole
episode with some caveats it's not only because of the point I made before but
also because this is probably the first podcast where I'm actually being critical
of a certain ideology and certain cultural movement I generally don't
tend to do that but this is the first time I'm actually I think breaking down
my qualms with a certain movement and my disagreements with a certain ideology
and fleshing it out on a podcast therefore I would say things that
contradict my claims especially my critique of ideology ironically I
think I'm gonna critique ideology using ideology so if so facto at times I will
be an utter hypocrite I will also say adding on to that point I haven't given
any of these communities the time and research effort they deserve so I really
do apologize if I'm being casually cynical or dismissive of the ideologies
I mean it does take a lot of work to truly understand the essence of what
these cultural movements and subcultures are and in no way would I like my my
intent at least and and that's why I said I recorded this podcast five times
already for four times already this is the fifth time because I just didn't
want to misrepresent these movements the way the corporate media does so I hope
at least my intent in making this recording this episode comes across
and I'll definitely put in the intellectual and even experiential
labor to try and understand these groups and the individuals within these
groups deeply as a matter of fact I'm reading Rolo Rolo Tomasi's book the
Rational Male now you know according to his own Amazon page I think he calls
let me actually look it up according to his own Amazon page he calls himself the
godfather of the red pill and I feel like he's very influential amongst his
red pill aiding manist fear community helping men find women and get into
relationships and all that and look even his book there are some some good
advice I think there were some things that are it can be applicable to in our
lives and I also wanted to sort of understand the broader view of how he
views sexual dynamics and relationships between men and women which is why I
said that I'm not I'm not gonna just watch a few episodes on YouTube or watch
a few go through a few ready threads I'm actually gonna try and you know read
read the books that come out of these communities because I feel like writing
is the most pulled out most precise and well detailed ports for you truly want
to know a person well first look at what they do but also read what they write
over what they say because what they write in some sense is more pulled out
fleshed out ideas and it's because of that I would say because of all these
points I made that this will definitely be my first episode on this topic of
many to come because these subcultures I hate it when you know corporate media
maligns them saying that there's some French far-right group or some silly
thing like that because they actually are quite influential I personally know a
lot of people that are that I've got great benefit from these communities and
that would be including myself which is why I firstly want to make a case in
defense of bro culture now we've got a delineate bro culture from the red pill
communities on the internet I think bro culture is a bit more broader whereas
red pill is a lot more political oh by the way I just want to add a point since
obviously MGTOW manners fee and no fap it's all a mouthful as a umbrella term
I'll just use the word red pill community but I do think this whole bro
culture and this idea of you know masculinity what would it call it
hyper masculinity maybe that's connected a lot with the red pill community it goes
hand-in-hand in many ways I gotta say as a young man when I was maybe 17 18 or
probably even a bit younger and then even into my early 20s like 1920 maybe
even 21 bro culture was extremely beneficial for me as a young person
and the best way to define what bro culture is is through my anecdotal
experience so bro culture is greatly connected to sports and and yeah like
the red hole the whole red pill thing it's interesting right because a lot of
people that generally tend to be a part of really embrace that bro doctor in the
bro culture they probably would consider themselves to be red pill or
whatever and a good way to define bro culture is actually by a speech by
theta Roosevelt the eponymous speech called the strenuous life and I think
it captures what bro culture is best in a more refined gentlemanly manner and I
quote a small part from the speech it says I wish to preach not the doctrine
of ignoble ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life the life of toil and
effort of labor and strife to preach that highest form of success which comes
not to the man who desires mere easy peace but to the man who does not shrink
from danger from hardship all from bitter toil and who out of these wins
the splendid ultimate triumph so yes as I said this is kind of the message of
bro culture it's the whole pull yourself up by your bootstraps message and as I
I'm probably repeating myself now it's deeply associated with sports it's this
embrace of masculinity the good and the bad keep in mind and it gives the
message of self-reliance to nasty discipline and I feel especially for
young boys and young men this is a great message you know leaving aside politics
the whole you know picking up women thing and the whole all the critiques
that are come to their own I still believe essentially these are good
messages you know they they not just for men but even for women telling someone
to take responsibility for their life it's something that we don't hear much
in contemporary culture and I would also say you know on the on the topic of
strength and sort of self-improvement let's say a good good example is Elliot
Hulls now undoubtedly Elliot Hulls is a full-owned bro he's like the
quintessential bro and is also very much in the whole redfoot community he's
going through his own face he had the whole mega thing now I used to watch a
lot of Elliot Hulls videos because I was rather I would say enamored by strength
I still am I I admire strength and you know really like strong man and I used
to watch some some of his some of his videos to you know just to do strong
men workouts and all that before I stopped because suddenly I felt like he
became this very zealous track on traditional conservative and you know
he was like all he talks about is like how women should submit to men and and he
really kind of embodied that whole traditional conservative I don't even
know the track on ethos into himself and then it frankly it became as much as I
still like him I still think he gives good advice like for example I'm gonna
pick up a small clip from his podcast here to you know exemplify what I mean
but he's became this like a knowing ideologue that constantly preached track
on values and and constantly evangelized his way of living and prescribed
his way of living on to the world and I guess on to his videos in this case but
despite all of that this is an example of why I think this whole bro culture
movement and the let's say the what's the word not port leaders but the more
more influential people in this movement do give a good message so this one's on
the whole no fat movement and which is also connected to all of this look I
think the young people especially young men have a massive problem
I've dealt with it I would call it a behavioral addiction I think a lot of
people are either ashamed to talk about it or they trivialize it but as far as
I'm concerned I know a lot of my mates who sometimes ah it's like if that is an
addiction I don't know what it is you know like they'll go hours sometimes you
know indulging themselves in porn consuming porn so it definitely is a
problem it's definitely something that has to be spoken of and for the longest
time the only people that spoke about porn addiction and this problem with
internet pornography were the red pill bros or the people in this you know no
fat movement which is connected to the bro culture they're the only people that
actually spoke about how this is probably a dangerous thing that it's
probably affecting young people in their cases focus more on men you know
psychologically spiritually but I found this particular video by Elliot to be a
rather astute take because he doesn't just say don't watch porn don't jerk off
or he doesn't just say you know don't don't be a loser that just sits in your
jocks in front of a computer all day and you know jerks off for women on the
internet just jerks off to women on the internet he actually makes a very very
interesting point and this is a bit bit of a longer video but I think what he's
trying to say is a good example of the kind of messages one could hear from
the bro culture movement and then how that could be greatly beneficial for
young people mostly for young people but for anyone really I've heard you yo
Elliot I've heard you say that men in their 20s should bust their nut once a
week why is this I think I'd like to retain for as much longer than one week
thank you I'm loving this program so first of all I have my conviction about
it that comes from what I've studied right again this is I'm not an expert in
this but I've often referred to this great little book called listen to your
body it's based on traditional Chinese medicine and I do think that there's
some value I think there's tremendous value to Chinese medicine and natural
health right essentially it's natural health how to be healthy naturally
without you know big pharma and so there are ways to live that that improve
longevity and vitality and make you feel good right make you make you the best
you and so according to traditional Chinese medicine in this nice little cute
little book he goes on and says that there are clear guidelines and traditional
Chinese medicine about ejaculation of sperm so the the premise is that the
more you blow your load the more you're you're losing your vitality right and I
think we've all sort of experienced that right I know I've had right it took me
until my 40s I didn't realize it when I was younger a lot of you guys recognize
it more for whatever reason but not until my 40s I started to recognize it
boy the day after I blow my load and for like you know a day or two a little off
and then I also discovered takes me about 10 days personally at this point for
me to feel that vigor that fire that I've had before blowing my load and now it
makes it makes sense to me now after reading this pseudoscientific right I
don't think there's anything wrong with pseudoscience right in fact like the
whole vaccine thing is pseudoscience it's like not exactly science but they're
pointing at something there see what I mean for some reason unfortunately
because they get sucked into ideology suddenly everyone who's a part of the
Red Bull movement also have to be you know I would say I'm fairly critical of
vaccines and the whole movement or what whole whole thing that happened during
COVID in any case out of the video so anyway it says clear guidelines about
ejaculation of sperm in general not more than twice a month is advised because of
loss of vitality other considerations includes the men's health and his age
the ancient texts give the following advice for a man of 20 years old once in
every four days just going based on that right at 30 once every eight days at 40
once every 16 days at 50 once every 20 days and at 60 once a month so I come to
the conclusion now this validates what was my conclusion or they kind of work
together I don't know if I had this thought and then read it in the book or
read the book and it helped me have thought but I've sort of sort of brought
this together in my own mind that's or based on my experience as well this is
I think this is a pretty solid guideline it doesn't mean that it's written in
stone but one of the things that I've discovered just through my own
experience but watching you guys and watching videos and noticing this whole
no-fat we seem in retention movement there are a few things that could be
pathological about it and one of them is that it becomes starts to become a God
it starts to become an obsession what I mean by that right in the same way that
masturbation becomes an obsession right because you're engaging in that ritual
and you're worshiping porn every day when you do this there is a sense of pride I
started to notice it when I was fasting right I fasted before doing see you
seem to retention I fasted you know started fasting back in 2018 I only
started doing similar attention this year and so I'm careful with myself because
I saw what happened to me with fasting I started to get proud I started to
personally identify with my streaks you catch where I'm going with this I started
to make it a bigger deal than what it was and the month the monks the the the
month the monastery the guys in the monasteries right I think I remember
reading this from Brianna Shav also he talks about how not to be too austere
with yourself for fear of pride he says that Satan loves it when you're really
tough on yourself because then you start to become you know hmm well I did no
fat for 20 days I did 30 days I did 50 days all right so then it starts to
become a religion it starts to become an obsession it starts to become an idol
that's barely what it ends up becoming right I fasted wow this guy fasted for
10 days why he fasted for 20 days well I only fasted for five days I gotta live
up to these guys it starts to become an ego issue and I don't and I wouldn't
have been able to warn against this as it relates to semen retention had I not
messed up during my first season of fasting now I don't take myself too
seriously with any of this stuff in other words I don't make it an idol I
don't have I'm not personally identified with it I don't get my sense of value
and self-worth from it so that's just that's one warning right that's more of
us that's more of a spiritual warning it's a warning against pride that's all
it is right start to feel like well look what I did and even that just just just
the whole idea that I am going to fast is sort of an idol it's sort of a
egotistical way of looking at it when the saints and the divines and the
mystics right I love the orthodox tradition they even call some of their
guys mystics they they they recognize that it is it's a it's a spiritual battle
that you're you're gearing up for it's not a matter of challenging yourself
right it's and and when it's a spiritual battle it's beyond your will and so I can
will myself to get something done and then I can be proud about it because look
at me or if it's a spiritual fast it's a spiritual retention or abstinence right
it's God is helping me God has given me grace to do this this is a humble way of
looking at life that saves us from pride but also saves us from depression
because if you start to think that it's up to me to get things done and they
don't get done you're gonna feel bad about yourself so both either way if we
if our if our will wins or loses we lose if your will wins you will you lose
because you become proud if your will loses you lose because you take that
personally as well it's like the opposite of pride but it's on the same
spectrum I don't even know what to call it right but like depression right
depression is on the same spectrum of pride I don't that's the right word but
feeling sorry and sad about yourself is just as it's almost it's a it's a
other side of the same coin of feeling proud and good about yourself because
they're both wrapped up in what I can do what I didn't do as opposed to resting
in the Lord and saying and asking God to give me the grace I think that
perspective is good for us right again once again I don't know I know that
there's spiritual wisdom in the literature and the Bible and stuff like
this right I know that there are good ideas that propounded by ascetics and
such and then there are commandments things to do and not to do but in my
life I've looked at those things and I recognize them as maybe external like
okay I get that I see that I understand that but it's not until and maybe we got
to make our own mistakes is not until I've seen it in myself and others that
I'm like oh this is practical advice it's not just religious weird stuff right
so you know people are like oh that's all archaic religious thinking well it's
actually very practical right so it's very practical to lean on God lean on
the Creator lean on the Father lean on nature whatever you want to call it even
though nature is a fruit of God I want to be in walking with the Creator rather
than offering it up or recognizing that I am not 100% sovereign over my life but
the grace and mercy of God precedes me then you can't get depressed you can't
get depressed you can't get depressed because your life is in the hands of
the Lord and if he sees it fit for you to have this failure then it's up to you
to be grateful for and see the lining in the cloud the silver lining of the
cloud right every every every bad thing that happens to us it's because God is
allowing it to happen to us because we're supposed to make something of it
but if you think that you're in charge and something bad happens you start
going okay what did I do how do I fix this why why why me I screwed up I'm such
a bad person and the same thing on the other side right it's the same coin same
coin oh look what I did proud of me look at this I did it and you didn't
right it's the same shit same shit you gotta stop you gotta stop and so as just
a warning against that right I'm not saying that's gonna happen to you but
just as a warning I advise not to push ourselves that hard I know that doesn't
I know that sounds like a contradiction from you know pro-masculine Elliot that's
telling everybody to do hard stuff but having austerity having discipline being
committed to something is very different than being attached to something
making something an idol and and and being personally identified with it very
different things try your best in everything that you do but leave room
for God that's all it is I feel like this is like you know Elliot being the
as I said the quintessential example of what a you know the port leader in the
broke culture movement would be this is great this is great advice he speaks
about humility he speaks about he doesn't speak about mere like peace
unanimous weak humility but he speaks about genuine humility he speaks about
the dangers of pride and you know as our culture has become more and more
secular and more materialistic we don't really talk about those let's say higher
human virtues anymore and when I was younger before you know I understand
Elliot was kind of evangelizing he has become very religious but even before he
became sort of the Tractcon bro he used to talk a lot about these things in the
middle of the strength cam strongman videos he would give really good life
advice and I wouldn't even go to his channel for life advice per se as like
a teenager but he'd you know slip it in somewhere and then I'm and I think to
myself oh that's actually that's a that's a gem right there that's quite
interesting you know when he's for example he spoke about how depression and
pride or depression and this sense of euphoria and and eternal happiness or
whatever you may call it it's the same side of the same is this is a is a
different side of the same coin that's a very very brilliant insight that that
shows he's got perspicuity perspicuity and which is why I think messages like
this all these workshops and different seminars that they organize in these
communities it provides community it provides brotherhood and fatherhood you
know we I believe definitely are living in the midst of a loneliness pandemic a
lot of people I can speak you know through my personal anecdotes through
personal conversations conversations I've had and stuff I've read are lonely
unfortunately due to unfortunately modernity after industrialization
and you know how how how capitalism has just completely been so
pernicious in our society and made people into cogs in this massive machine
it's alienated us and that has created a lot of loneliness that along with you
know traditional little traditional small-scale communities are dying off and
people are becoming more cosmopolitan and people are going to cities these
smaller communities that with the epicenters of meaning and community
with them dying off definitely a lot of people are feeling a lot more alienated
ironically even though we think we are happy connected and all of these yearnings
all of these yearnings that young men let me let me speak for young men from
over here young men from over here have you know the yearning for brotherhood
the yearning for structure the yearning for a purpose the bro culture
full first is yearnings at least it gave me a structure when I was a lot younger
and it really wasn't really comfortable in my own shoes let's say so the reason I wanted to
put that part in the podcast is I wanted to be genuine and sincere and show that I'm not being
casually dismissive I use that term a lot these days casually dismissive of these
movements and I'm actually they've actually you know helped me a lot they've benefited me a lot
and I've even been a part of these movements when I was younger which is why probably I
have more insight into how to criticize them because I understood how a certain person in a
red pill movement would think now the first this first point is generally the problem with
subcultures not nothing particularly specific to the red pill bros it is that internet subcultures
they kind of become a bit cultish for sure but they also inevitably go to the extreme
and they're inherently ideological like they cannot exist without being ideological because
they they need a dogma they need a doctrine to attract people and then they need and then that
doctrine once it's got enough people it becomes a self perpetuating belief it becomes a self
sustaining belief the more people that join these different communities I also believe and I can't
get to this get into this in this whole in this podcast because it's a it's a whole book but I
also believe that unlike religion ideology never tells a full story whereas religion I believe
gives the complete narrative most religious stories give the complete narrative ideology tells
only one part of the story I think it was Jordan Peterson who really made this crystallized this
in my mind when I heard him talk about this but I thought that makes a lot of sense so of course
I've used the word ideology a lot I've said that I'm critical of these subcultures I've also said
that I'm critical of the fact that they are ideological plus I'm critical of the ideology
so many things I'm critical of but let's try and understand what ideology is now
it's a difficult thing to defend you know ideology isn't merely a set of principles or a set of
beliefs that refuse to update itself it's a lot more deeper than that it it affects us the subject
psychologically way way more deeply than I thought until I was exposed to Slavojic's work so Slavojic
kind of talks about ideology in his film the perverts guy to ideology and he describes ideology
best I think here's a short clip hey buddy you're gonna pay for that or what
look buddy I don't want no house today either pay for it or put it back
according to our common sense we think that ideology is something blurring confusing our
straight view ideology should be glasses which distort our view and the critique of ideology
should be the opposite like you take off the glasses so that you can finally see the way things
really are this precisely and here the pessimism of the film of the leaf is well justified this
precisely is the ultimate illusion ideology is not simply imposed on ourselves ideology is our
spontaneous relationship to our social world how we perceive its meaning and so on and so on we in a
way enjoy our ideology all right to step out of ideology it hurts it's a painful experience you must
force yourself to do it this is rendered in a wonderful way with a further scene in the film
where John Nada tries to force his best friend John Armitage to also put the glasses on I don't
want to fight you come on I don't want to fight stop it no and it's the weirdest scene in the
film the fight takes eight nine minutes it may appear irrational because why does this guy
reject so violently to put the glasses on it is as if he is well aware that spontaneously he lives
in a lie that the glasses will make him see the truth but that this truth can be painful can
shatter many of your illusions this is a paradox we have to accept
the extreme violence of liberation you must be forced to be free if you trust simply your
spontaneous sense of well-being or whatever you will never get free what freedom hurts
brilliantly put you know I I think it was only Zizek who really made me understand how
much ideology captivates us and once it does why it's so difficult for us to let go of it
so in that sense I actually feel a deep sense of empathy with ideologues because you know actually
let me let me read a few excerpts from this essay by Mack Mack McManus on the philosophy of Zizek
he says the appeal of ideology is that it enables us to bring psychic stability to a social and
natural world that is chaotic and broken in and of itself that's an important point the
latter point is something I it took me a bit of time to understand this of what Zizek is trying to
convey according to Zizek the essence of being it may be even a metaphysical ontological claim
is chaotic so what ideology does it is at as Mack specifies here it gives psychic stability
which is why once we are assessed by an ideology once we become let's say the red pill ideology
or the feminist ideology or some some political framework or some sociopolitical framework that
takes hold of us it fundamentally changes our psychology it fundamentally affects our psyche
and then we we just don't want to let go of it because as Zizek says freedom hurts because freedom
really is the is the confrontation of this chaotic nature of this chaotic essence of being
and that's a scary thing and you know going on with the essay oh by the way the essay is was on
a road magazine it's called the philosophy of Slavo Zizek I haven't read all of Zizek's books for
sure but I've read a lot read and listened to a lot of his lectures and I would say this essay was
quite apt and quite accurate as to what Zizek tries to convey through his work another except
is ideology provides us with a way of projecting psychic stability onto the world for instance
it enables us to simplify complex sociopolitical and natural processes into simple partisan
narratives once again the red pill bros would say all of the problems that men have are because of
feminist or because of modernity or because of you know neoliberalism or blame it on some group
blame it on the other and that is taking a very complex sociopolitical change and a natural process
of society evolving and breaking it simply into partisan narratives or breaking it simply into
something a lot more tribal and that's the danger of ideology and this again I'm still in some sense
even though I'm connecting this to the red pill movement I'm still making a very general point
on how anyone is susceptible any movement is susceptible to ideology including religion of
course that's when it becomes fundamentalism ideology simplifies the chaotic incompleteness
of society and nature and provides us with a firm sense of identity and values there you go
it's what's interesting is you know the latter point there and provides us with the firm sense
of identity and values so you probably remember I said initially that you know in my part where I
was talking about in defense of bro culture how as a young person these red pill movements gave me
structure gave me a framework to view the world through and it took me a long time probably
21 22 and maybe even 23 took me about two to three years to break out of it because breaking
out of it for me it was a daunting task it perturbed me it brought this sense of existential
angst so again then I man I really hope I don't sound super serious or patronizing when I say this
that's definitely not I'm not trying to say or look at me over here free from ideology I've I've
got over the red pill movement I've got over all these different subcultures on the internet and
I'm my own person and I'm so like above them and pointing fingers at them I really hope I'm not
doing that I I'm what I'm saying is I totally empathize with why we're attracted to these
movements and how their their doctrines assess us and you know when Kekkergaard again was the
influence sorry Zizek was again influenced by Kekkergaard and you know when when Zizek talks
about this how the the essence of the world is is kind of broken and chaotic I think it comes a
lot from absurdism you know of course popularized by Camel but Camel 2 was influenced by Kekkergaard
and I believe Kekkergaard said this very famous paragraph of his in his book either rule and I
think this is a very this is this is like typical Kekkergaard you know with the humor and with the
absurdity but it's also a a it's a it's a typical sentiment of kind of the existentialist it goes
something like this marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or
don't marry you will regret it either way laugh at the world's foolishness you will regret it
weep over it you will regret that too laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it you will
regret both believe a woman you will regret it believe her or not you will also regret it hang
yourself you will regret it do not hang yourself you will regret that too hang yourself or don't
hang yourself, you'll regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself,
you will regret both. This gentleman is the essence of old philosophy.
There are some things that are just so true that the only way to speak about them is through
humor, through fuzz. And I think that's what character God is doing here. And then of course,
another famous line from Camus, myth of pacifist, he says, man stands face to face with irrational,
he feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born out of this
confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.
This is deeply true. We all look for psychic stability of some kind to cushion ourselves and
sometimes even distract ourselves from the absurd. And we have no choice. We need to confront the
absurd. So my biggest problem with ideology is in some sense, ideology makes one a coward.
It tells one that no, just be comfortable in your own little bubble in this little ideological
framework and do not confront the absurd, do not confront the chaotic nature of the world,
which takes courage. And I believe it's in that confrontation once, once soul matures and when
develops his character and builds those higher virtues that we so rarely speak about these days.
Now, I come to something maybe a bit more specific to the red pill movement. And maybe
actually, since I did speak about Rollo Tomasi a bit earlier in his whole manosphere and because
even though he touches on politics, and especially he's very, very critical of feminism,
he also focuses a lot on gender dynamics and sexual dynamics and relationships and dating
between men and women. So in his book, The Rational Male, and I think this is like the
gist of what I got when I was reading it, but I didn't just want to read it, even though I
felt reading his book is important for this particular podcast episode. I also listened
to some of his interviews and a big problem with modern society and this really angers me.
It really annoys me is we've completely lost ourselves in abstracting and categorizing
at infinity. We truly stopped looking as people as individuals and rather started looking at them
as abstractions. And this has got nothing to do with left, right. It's just, it's a cultural,
it's a cultural zeitgeist shift. Because we live in such a globalized world, we've begun to
bureaucratize everything. Everything is becoming rather Kafkaesque and the human individual in
some sense is being negated, is being made into non-being, let's say, because we've completely
begun categorizing everything. Men are this way. Women are this way. Black people are this way.
White people are this way. Ah, I don't want to keep going. Gay people are this way. LGBTQ folks
are that way. It never stops. And the more we do this, the more we demean and the more
value we give to the individual souls. The uniqueness, the idiosyncrasies of the individual,
the nuances of being an individual, we don't pay attention to that anymore.
And that again, I do blame a lot for the death of religion. I do think a lot of religions speak
a lot about that kind of individual spirituality, individual connection with the transcendent,
with the divine, and with this kind of abstract categorizing that rarely happens. Sell them,
does that happen? So, as I said, we've stopped looking at the souls, we've become
the categorized people, and it's also become kind of obsessive. You look at psychologists that
talk about the big five and talk about psychometricians, because maybe that itself is its own
ideology because it's easy. It's an easy way to make sense of the world when we categorize things
and put things in their place and give things order. I only really started to understand this
phenomenon when I read Dostoevsky, especially when I read this part in the Brothers Karamazov,
where I believe Father Zerzima is speaking to this young woman who says that she cannot.
Father Zerzima, by the way, is one of the wiser, sort of sage-like characters in
Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov. So, he's talking to this young woman who
says she cannot love people, she cannot love humanity, and then he responds with this beautiful
paragraph. He says, it's just the same story as a doctor once told me, observe the elder.
He was a man getting on in years and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in
jest, in bitter jest. I love humanity, he said, but I wonder at myself, the more I love humanity in
general, the less I love man in particular. In my dreams, he said, I have come, I've often come to
making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have
faced crucifixion if it had been soundly necessary. And yet, I am incapable of living in the same
room with anyone for two days together, as I know by experience. As soon as anyone is near me,
his personality disturbs my self complacency and restricts my freedom. In 24 hours, I begin to hate
the best of man, one because he's too low over his dinner, another because he has a cold and keeps
on blowing his nose. That was probably me. I become hostile to people the moment they come
close to me, but it has always happened that the more I detest men individually, the more ardently
my love for humanity. What a, man, you gotta read Dostoevsky, man, like what a, what a brilliant
point, what an astute take on society. Many of these internets of cultures are making the same
mistake that Father Duzima talks about. As I said, people like Rolo Tomasi, the more I listen to him
on what I hear, you know, what's funny is he unknowingly does this, he'd even explicitly say,
I'm not generalizing, but then he'll go ahead and generalize. I remember he was having this
conversation with a, with another woman and they were kind of going at it. They were in
deep disagreement. And even when she shared something about her personal life, he instantly
took what she said and tried to abstract it out and put her into some box. I didn't see him
truly paying attention to what her as a unique individual was saying, but he had to really
get the gist of what she was saying and they put her in a box, you're this kind of woman.
And I think that's really unfortunate because, you know, whether, whether he disagreed or
agreed with her, it doesn't, it's not the case. It doesn't matter. It's paying attention to what
her as an individual was saying, which is, you know, to be fair, what the psychoanalyst discovered,
you know, the Freud's that you gotta truly, truly listen to a person as to what they're saying.
Don't try and make assumptions. Don't try and pigeonhole them. Don't try and put them in boxes.
Just pay attention. So all of these subcultures, subcultures, they unknowingly categorize women,
men, and relationships to the extreme. And yes, this may be beneficial for some people,
but I think what that does is again, this is something, this is ineffable,
actually there's this ineffable human experience. It can't even be spoken of.
And I think we really feel it only when we pay attention. When we do this kind of categorizing
and generalizing, we lose that. It's a magical, beautiful thing. It's a live,
sustaining thing. And I feel like a lot of us in modernity have lost that.
And to be fair, this is no different to what a radical feminist or
someone in Antifa or some other ideologue would do. This again is a problem with ideology,
and which is why I think even though one can take certain lessons from the Red Perk community,
like the lesson that Elliot gave about, you know, porn and no-fup and all of that,
one should never completely let the ideology control one and become a mouthpiece for the
ideology and not to never be afraid to think freely and think independently. It is the most
important thing. It's having the courage to confront the chaos of the world and to truly
be an independent thinker. One should never forget that. I would also say maybe this is
a bit of an ancillary point, but I think it's connected, you know, as the book itself says,
it's the rational male. All these books are called the rational male, so Rolo Tamasi
deeply respects reason. And generally people who tend to be the rationalist types, the Stephen
Pinkers, people who, you know, hold reason to be the highest virtue, let's say, they tend to play
a lot in this abstract game, in this game of abstractions and conceptualization. So the Rolo,
in some sense, one can never win a debate with Rolo because he would say the moment,
let's say, we make an experiential claim, not an axiomatic truth, maybe make an experiential
claim from our own subjective life, not some kind of sadistic or objective claim that just
generally applies to everyone, but rather a subjective claim. He'll say, you're being irrational,
therefore you lose the debate. So he's already set the axioms or he's already set the rules for
a conversation even before we get into a conversation. So there's no way, which is why,
you know, Rolo Tamasi is kind of the Ben Shapiro, so some of those guys, you rarely see them lose
a debate because the framework they view through is that of reason. And again, I'm not being
critical of reason. Reason is important. In some sense, I'm using reason in this podcast to
flesh out my points and, you know, lay out my criticisms. But reason isn't the only
form of epistemology, let's say. It's not the only way of truth. There are many ways. For me,
in some sense, I probably value experiential truth more than even reason-based truth, because for
me, in some sense, one's experience is more palpable. It's more real. It's what one truly feels.
And I would say, to end off this segment, the truth is, you know, we're all deeply lonely. No
one will truly ever understand us. We must accept this verity that we are all deeply lonely. No one,
not even one's wife, one's partner would truly know what happens in one's mind, what experiences we
have. So this loneliness itself is a, you know, existential part of life. I think Paul Tillich
talks about, in his phenomenology, he talks about this concept of anxiety. And he talks about
meaninglessness a lot. But meaninglessness is one thing. But even I think Paul Tillich also touches
on the idea of us just being lonely, us just being like an atom detached from being this
incongruent we feel between ourselves and the world. And we must confront this. There's no other
way. There's no other way. Ideology isn't going to rescue us, I put it that way.
And now, this may be, oh man, on the whole dating thing, I couldn't believe some of the messages
either explicitly or tacitly that these communities give out. I'm going to be honest,
it rather disgusted me, you know, some of the ways that they generalize women and they say that
women are like this, women want this kind of men. And I rarely, rarely hear these groups talk about
love, various love in dating. I don't think I've even hear the word love come out because
essentially, for me, that's what dating is about. I date for love, for monogamy, for marriage, for
deep commitment. And all these communities, you know, people, let's say from the man's sphere or
the red pill dating communities make the whole relationship thing like a game, that it's just a
it's a zero sum game where you got to one up each other and you got to win, you know, they'll use
terms like sexual marketplace or sexual market value, detrimental terms. They use terms like
economically attractive and they'll completely commoditize individuals or women in this case.
And, you know, that definitely is because of how pernicious I think capitalism has become. And
in some sense, this is what Gijek, you know, who's very, very critical of capitalism says,
it's not that ideology that they're the ideology of capitalism has just
this detached system that just exists on its own. It deeply affects us, the subjects who are
involved in it. And as a result of that, which is why even something like dating, which I believe
should be undergirded by love becomes a marketplace becomes an economical transaction.
And the more I listen to, you know, even even when I was reading the book, you know, they talk
about concepts like hypergamy. And I understand that a hypergamy definitely has a lot of evidence
for it. But still, they'll state some facts. So we run into the, you know, it's old problem,
they'll state some facts. This is how things are. And the odd would be, the odd would be this sort of
cajoled or this contrived idea of the ideological presuppositions. And, you know, honestly,
some of them make women look like the self-serving, rapacious capitalists who only
date men for, for pretty much for social status or money. I would say, man, I really recommend
this video by Olivia. I'm not going to pay the whole thing because it's 20 minutes. It's called
our conception of love is messed up. It's such a beautiful video. I truly resonate with what
Olivia says here. She's a great YouTuber. I'll leave a link to it down in the description. I'd
probably play it. And also Bell Hooks, President Peace Queen, say we need to shift our perspective.
Anyway, I'm not going to, I'm not going to play the whole thing because it's 25 minutes.
And she talks about how a modern conception of love is all about how can I better myself? How
can I look better? How can I look more healthy, you know, so that I can be more attractive to my
partner? And she says, instead, why not treat love like an art? Why not treat dating of how can I
give myself to the other person? How can I fulfill the other person's needs? And instead of saying,
how can I better myself? How can I play this game? And then if the other person has a bad day,
if the other person doesn't reciprocate, then this person's up for me. I don't love this person.
Like love is, you know, in that sense, love is metaphysical. Love isn't a mere transactional
thing. And, you know, Olivia makes a good point that love has to be detached from
capitalist ideology. For me, I was talking a bit about absurdism before. For me, essentially,
the antidote to absurdism and this sense of meaninglessness is love. It's not just love in
relationships and dating, of course. It's not just romantic love, but it's, you know,
love within family, you know, what's it called? Is it filial love? I forget, love within friends,
and even if possible, love for humanity as a whole. And when we view this whole thing as some
zero sum game, it truly corrupts it. It taints it. And I would say this, and I really want to make
this point. Love is terrifying. It's beautiful than terrifying. I've fallen in love twice in my life.
The first time, it was beautiful than terrifying. The second time, it's beautiful than terrifying.
And in some sense, I had no, I had no, it wasn't up to my own volition. I had no choice in falling
in love, which is probably why they call it the fall. And, you know, the whole red pig communities
and the people like Robo Tamasi make it look like, pick some boxes and completely plan it out. And
then you'll find the perfect woman, the ideal woman that you want to spend the rest of your life with.
But that's not true. Life, life doesn't work like that. You know, yeah, you could write a book,
you could make some very smart rationalistic arguments and contrive them, you know, using
language. But in real life, and this is kind of why I spoke earlier about paying attention to one's
subjective experience, one's deep personal being. Love is a risk. And I truly believe that there
truly isn't any substance to one's soul without risk and faith, which is why love takes courage for
sure. But it also takes a leap of faith. It's not a mere game or it's not a mere, it's not like a
job interview where you take some boxes and you work through some framework. It's, it's metaphysical,
it's spiritual, it's beyond that. And it's true that I think one truly becomes a complete person.
It's through that risk, through that Kerekardian leap of faith. And keep in mind, Kerekard never
said when you take the leap, the landing is soft. The landing can be terrible. Nevertheless,
one has to take the leap. And which is why it is not a, I'm not making a rational case here. You
might, everything I'm saying may, may sound like nonsense, but I guess I would say don't even listen
to what I'm saying, pay attention to what your heart's saying, pay attention to where your heart's
leading you. And that, that takes practice. It's not easy to be attentive, attentive to oneself.
You know, I would also say another thing about hypergamy and women's liberation. So
firstly, I want to play this clip by Gizek. He talks about marriage. I think it's a beautiful,
beautiful clip from a recent interview he did. And you know, Gizek also influenced me to get
this view of love. So one thing the Red Pearl community, all the Red Pearl bros say is that
because, you know, women are liberated now, you know, women don't have to rely on men.
Let's say for financial needs, women can earn as much as men want to earn. They can have their own
careers. They can have their own life. And therefore this whole concept of hypergamy,
it's probably not, it's probably, well, hypergamy still exists, but it's not how it probably traditionally
existed where women relied on men as being the providers, as being the breadwinners of a family,
but rather men and women both have independence to fend for themselves.
And what Gizek says, which is fantastic, is that women's liberation has actually, has actually
given way for genuine love, you know, and maybe this is a, there you go, a good thing about
capitalism, because the free market has given that kind of freedom that the liberation of the
genders has given way for true genuine love, where a man and woman can be in a relationship,
can get married, if they truly love each other and for nothing else, not for any financial
benefit or not for any kind of, as I said, game in the sexual marketplace or some game of hypergamy,
it could truly be something metaphysical in that sense. And I want to make this, play this
clip by Gizek when he talks about marriage, which, by the way, for me is the deepest manifestation
of love. It's the most, maybe the highest thing one could do symbolically to declare one's love.
And here's what Gizek says. I think that precisely, because it no longer has this economic function,
marriage today can be something beautiful, it's just a pure commitment. You say basically to
society, I care for this person more than for anybody else. I want to be, it's just for me,
it can survive marriage as a commitment to share a world with somebody. For me, okay, sex is beautiful,
passion at night, whatever. But as we all know, then when you awaken, no, there is a problem.
And here true love begins for me. You know, when you, it's not just we were all the night doing it,
but when you have to build patiently small daily rituals, daily life, who will clean the toilet,
who will do this, who will do that, all these wonderful small rituals, how do you prepare
breakfast, we go there. And that's, for me, the true miracle of marriage, this commitment of two,
that's why I also, maybe this will be disappointed to readers, I don't believe in this fashionable
notion of polyamory, you know, oh, I can love more persons.
Any other relationship?
I don't, I'm not a moralist, I don't care if people do it. For me, but for me, there is still
something absolutely exclusive about loving just one person. Because, you know, because,
how should I put it, when you have polyamory, open relationships, it's usually too pragmatic,
it's I have different needs. Let's say for intelligent talks or whatever, I need you,
for intense sex, I need you, for fun, I need you, that's not love for me. Love is not about
satisfying your needs. Love is kind of a more metaphysical even, absolute trust. Love is,
I cannot live without you, and I'm ready to change radically just to be with you.
In this sense, I would say, I don't know what will happen, just let's not get rid of marriage,
because precisely today in our crazy world of all this, you know, the ideology today is experiment
with yourself. This is typical American ideology. Don't get fixed on something, different partners,
different sexual orientations. Today, you are heterosexual, make some homosexual experiments,
make some group orgy experiments and so on and so on. I don't find this satisfying.
Man, I can't even put into words how deeply I resonate with what Gigiak is saying. I, you know,
I've never been on dating apps. And again, I'm not critical of dating apps. I know a lot of people
who found great partners through dating apps. But the reason I never was on dating apps,
dating apps was because, well, I was in a long term relationship for about two and a half years.
So I really need one. But other than that, even after I broke up with my ex-partner, I
thought about it for a while. And then before I met my current partner during that period,
the interim period, let's say, I realized I don't want to play that game where,
you know, as Gigiak was saying, the game of experimentation, you know, I tried this woman,
I tried this woman, I tried this woman. It felt like, again, I was reducing women to just a mere
commodity and just a mere bunch of boxes or categories that I'm ticking off. And for me,
that's not what love is. For me, love is a risk. It's love is, it's a fall. And love is painful.
But one, one must experience all of life as that poem by,
by, Rilke goes, actually, let me pull it up the poem. I've got the poem, actually, I think I've
got it on my, I've got it saved up. Let's see. Oh, I want to show the of my, let me just switch
the camera because this is my personal notion. It's this poem called, Go to the Limits of Your
Belonging by Reina Marie Rilke. And there's one verse in the poem that goes, let everything happen
to you, beauty and terror, just keep going, no feeling is final. Don't let yourself lose me.
I love that idea of let everything happen to you. And I think it's in love, everything happens to
a person, the good, the bad, the ugly. So in any case, my point being, all of these subcultures,
as I've said many times, not probably ad nauseam, have their utility. They really do.
But the way to truly utilize these subcultures, the red pearl movement, the manosphere, even,
you know, books like this, like by Rolo Tamasi on dating and meeting them, which again, great advice,
is by having a sort of paradigm shift. And, and, and it's, it's essentially a philosophical
paradigm shift of looking, of how we as, as individuals look at other individuals and other
women. I'm just being specific to the whole dating thing and how we look at other people as souls,
you know, how we experience love. And I would even say this, you see, this whole podcast,
I'm essentially giving a irrational message because I'm telling to let people make mistakes.
I'm telling, let people even experience misery by the mistakes they make without prescribing an
ideology onto them. That's what I truly believe. I think that's what truly develops the human soul
and truly gives person the vast array of the human experience. Because if not, we're perpetually
going to be stuck. Not if not, we actually are always perpetually stuck in a is old problem.
Yes, we have a bunch of facts, but we derive the old from it. That's, that's the, the important
part. How do we derive the old from the S and ideology will say easy, just view the old or
derive the old through this framework and it's done. It requires no risk. It requires no thinking.
It requires no experience, but I think that leaves a person empty and it makes one's life
rather insipid to be frank. Thanks for listening.
