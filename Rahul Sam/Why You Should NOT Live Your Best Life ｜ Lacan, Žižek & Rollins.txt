Hey everyone, today I want to make the case as to why you should not live your best life
using the ideas of Jacques Lacourne, Slavoj Zizek, sprinkled in with a bit of the theology
of Peter Orleans.
Now firstly of course, let's try and understand what the thesis I'm trying to negate here
is.
What do I mean by living your best life?
I think the best way to make sense of this, let's call it societal, cultural imposition
is to go through podcasts that people consume and the books people read.
So if you look at contemporary culture and if you look at, let's say, consumerist, productivist,
moral injunctions, if you look at, let's say, the Amazon bestseller list, which I have opened
right here, I just googled it for this video, you'll see some of the bestselling books are
in the self-help category.
Books like Atomic Habits or Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life, and yes, there's some
pop fiction, but there certainly are many books that are either in the personal finance
or the self-help category, along with the New Age self-actualization category, books
like Ecatole, people like that.
And if you look at the top podcast, the podcast like Andrew Huberman's, what's it called,
the Huberman Lab podcast, which is a pretty good podcast on health and well-being.
But people certainly obsess over the tips that Andrew Huberman gives on how to optimize
your life, how to optimize your brain or your physiology and whatnot.
And then, of course, another example, which probably is a bit more from, even before my
time really, is the book The Secret by, what's her name, the Australian Bernd, whoever, Ronda
Bernd, right?
This book, just according to Wikipedia, it's sold over 30 million copies worldwide.
That's a lot of copies.
That certainly is the best seller that there was a documentary about this book.
People still talk about things like the law of attraction and this kind of, I call it
toxic positivity, where it seems like in our culture, the imposition, kind of the imposition
by God himself in many ways, is to live your best life, to self-actualize, to be as productive
as you can be, to be as healthy as you can be, and not only that, to also in the more
of the consumerist, crass, crude sense, to have as much as you want to have, not merely
in the sense of just, let's say, material things like clothes and shoes and cars and
watches and whatnot, but even experiences, travel, experience the world, and of course
we have, you know, terms, colloquial terms like FOMO, the fear of missing out and whatnot,
and all of this comes from this deep-seated imposition that we put onto ourselves, ironically,
or rather, physically, I'd say, to live your best life.
And the question is, what does that mean?
Why do we always feel guilty for not living our best life?
Why do we always feel guilty for missing out, not just on things that are purely entertaining,
but even on things like self-actualization and becoming divine in some sense, and becoming
whole, or to use a more technical term, why do we always have this desire for ontological
wholeness?
One way to answer that question is through the ideas of Peter Rowlands, who says that
we are subjects of the achievement society.
Our culture is a culture of self-help and achievement.
We have to live our best lives.
The kind of the imperative by God himself, even though most people in modernity are so
called atheists, is to self-actualize, to live your best life.
And unlike in the past, the categorical imperative to use a content term, or simply what we
are ought to do, what we should do, was don't lie, don't cheat, don't murder, don't commit
adultery, all the typical traditional Christian virtues, let's say.
The categorical imperative of our times, the demands of our times, is to achieve.
And that's why Peter Rowlands says, we are subjects.
We are people living in achievement society, or achievement culture, because that is ultimately
what we're supposed to do, achieve.
And if you could take those ideas of achievement, or living your best life, which seem a bit
more metaphysical, and let's say try and make them a bit more psychoanalytical, the best
way to put it is in Naos, Slavu, Zygex, catchphrase, which is, enjoy your super ego.
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that, because of some inner obstacles, you
internalized, identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions,
you cannot set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you.
It is accessible to you only in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on.
So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions
so that it enables you to enjoy.
The problem today is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different
ways.
There can be sexual enjoyment, consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment,
realize yourself, whatever.
And I think that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to
be able to spontaneously enjoy.
The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.
Now before I get to the negation to keep fleshing this idea out, I'm going to use two
books by Slavu Zygex.
The first one is perhaps his most, one of his most accessible books, How to Read Lacan,
and the second one is certainly one of his hardest books to read, for they know not what
they do.
Here's what he says about Super Ego or enjoy Super Ego in How to Read Lacan and after
I read from both these books I'll kind of explain what he means here.
Zygex states, Super Ego is real, the cruel and insatiable agency that bombards me with
the impossible demands and then mocks my botched attempts to meet them.
The agency in whose eyes I am all the more guilty.
The more I try to suppress my sinful strivings and meet its demands.
The cynical old Stalinist motto about the accused at show trials who profess their innocence,
the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot, is Super Ego at its purest.
But Lacan's Super Ego has nothing to do with moral conscience as far as its most obligatory
demands are concerned.
Super Ego is on the contrary the anti-ethical agency, the segmentization of my ethical
betrayal.
What except I read is a very, I call that summarized or culled down version of a very
perspicacious idea that Zygex has been writing about ever since he's been writing really.
The idea that the Lacanian Super Ego, at least in modernity in our culture, is quite different
to what we would, let's say, conventionally think about the Freudian Super Ego, where
generally if you ask from any person who has any idea of who Freud is and you bring up
the concept of a Super Ego, let's say the Super Ego is this ethical agency, kind of
like the, again, the Kantian categorical imperative that talks about, you know, don't lie, don't
cheat, be a good person, carry out your civic duties, what not.
Although our culture, things have shifted, our Super Ego is the imperative, as I said
many times already, to in fact be anti-ethical.
In fact, to, not in a hedonistic sense, to an indulge, indulge, indulge, but rather
it's to, the demand itself is to live your best life, as I said in this video.
And ironically, a part of living your best life is certainly being anti-ethical and doing
things that are moral transgressions, so to speak.
But also, again, the new age of self-actualization and whatnot.
But then comes the important point where he makes the cynical Stalinist joke that the
reality of the Super Ego demands are that they can never be met and in fact the more
we carry them out, the guiltier we feel, the more we engage in self-help, the more we engage
in productivity, reading all these books and listening to all these podcasts, all the other
side of things, the more consumerist we become, the more we try to experience new things and
constantly pursue novelty, the less emptier and more guiltier we feel in the sense that
we always feel we aren't doing enough and that's the cruel, sadistic nature of the
Super Ego.
So that idea of the Super Ego demands being unfulfillable brings us to an excerpt from
this book, for they know what they do, where initially, before I read the excerpt, Gizek
states that as we probably all kind of intuit, at least, we all kind of feel it that in post-modern
culture, we have no moral laws to say, we have no substructure that guides us in how
traditional societies did guide us in the sense that most people are atheistic, we have
no metaphysical principles and we don't have a lot of prohibitions.
Now of course, the naive way to view that is we think, oh, that means we can live in
infinite bliss and freedom, there isn't all these old patriarchal ways of existence, we
could just be free.
It's not so simple.
Here's what Gizek states.
He states, how do we account for this paradox that the absence of law universalizes prohibition?
There's only one possible explanation.
Enjoyment itself, which we experience as transgression, is in its innermost status something
in post-ordered when we enjoy.
We never do it spontaneously.
We always follow a certain injunction.
The psychoanalytical name for this obscene injunction, for this obscene call, enjoy your
super ego.
So here's where all the ideas connect.
In the past, the universal law, the Kantian categorical imperative was prohibition.
Do not do this.
Whereas now in our post-modern culture, it is you ought to do this.
You must do this.
You should do this.
You must read this many self-help books.
You must listen to all these productivity podcasts.
You must take care of your health.
You must focus solely on your well-being and on your health.
You must have this much money.
You must own this thing.
You must have this experience, so on and so on.
You get the point.
Of course, that begs the question, if the current imperative, and we can't detach ourselves
from these imperatives there, there, regardless of whether we like them or not, how do we
live our best life?
Unfortunately, here's where things get a bit dark.
It's impossible.
It's primarily due to reasons, because firstly, we don't really want to live our best life.
What we want to do is to fantasize about living our best life, but never really live it.
You have a serious ideological deviation at the very beginning of famous proclamation
of independence, you know, pursuit of happiness.
If there is a point in psychoanalysis, it is that people do not really want or desire
happiness, and I think it's good that it is like that.
For example, let's be serious.
When you are in a creative endeavor in that wonderful fever, my God, I'm on to something,
and so on.
Happiness doesn't enter it.
You are ready to suffer.
Sometimes scientists, I read history of quantum physics or earlier of radiation, were even
ready to take into account the possibility that they will die because of some radiation
and so on.
You know, happiness is, for me, an unethical category.
And also, we don't really want to get what we think that we want.
The classical story that I like, the traditional May-Schovenist scenario.
I'm married to a wife, relations with her are cold, and I have a mistress.
And all the time I dream, oh my God, if my wife were to disappear, I'm not a murderer,
but let us say, drop me, it would open up new life for me with the mistress.
You know what?
Every psychoanalyst will tell you, quite often it happens that then, for some reason, wife
goes away, you lose the mistress also.
You thought, this is all I want.
When you have it there, you turn out that it was a much more complex situation where
what you want is not really to live with the mistress, but to keep her as a distance, as
an object of desire about which you dream.
And this is not just an excessive situation.
I claim that this is how things function.
We don't really want what we think we desire.
And of course, manifest and consumerism, as we all know, the more we shop, the more we
buy things and purchase things, the more we want to shop and buy and purchase things.
What we are really looking for is, in that case, not a particular, a consumable item
or not a particular commodity, but rather, at a fundamental ontological level, what we
desire is the object, this virtual void that isn't there.
But perhaps even more pertinently to our times, leaving consumerism aside, because it seems
rather obvious, it is also the fact that we never do really want our desire to be ever
met.
Despite the fact that it's unfulfillable, regardless, what we want to do is fantasize
about this object, about getting whatever this virtual category is, this empty virtual
category is.
And perhaps the quintessential example is something like Paris Syndrome, where as we
all know, it's a phenomenon where many, many people, many, many tourists, whoever, they
always fantasize about Paris.
And once they do go to Paris, once they do go to France, they see that it's just the
brutal reality of what it is, and they see that it's just another stupid country.
Of course, what they really were fantasizing about wasn't Paris the actual material place,
rather the object.
And I think Gizek puts it best where he says that, if there's anything psychoanalysis has
told us, that is that human beings fundamentally don't want to be happy or don't want their
desires to be met.
So to keep expanding on this idea a bit more theoretically, Todd McGovern elucidates it
really well in his book, Capitalism and Desire, he states, capitalism is the effect of sustaining
subjects in a constant state of desire.
As subjects of capitalism, we are constantly on the edge of having our desire realized,
but never reached the point of realization.
Capitalism has the effect of producing a satisfaction that we don't recognize as such.
That is, capitalist subjects experience satisfaction itself as dissatisfying, which enables them
to simultaneously enjoy themselves and believe wholeheartedly that a more complete satisfaction
exists just around the corner embodied in the newest commodity.
So of course, when McGovern talks about capitalism, he's also talking about the capitalist ideology,
which is the kind of the culture that I'm talking about of living your best life.
And I'm sorry to quote myself here, but a little commentary on what Todd McGovern wrote.
Here's what I wrote.
And again, I'm sorry for narcissistically quoting myself.
Since our lack is unfulfillable and our desire is unmeetable, we are the perfect subjects
for capitalist dynamics because paradoxically, capitalism works by not working.
We're always kept on the edge of having our desires met by, in fact, not having them
ever met in reality.
So you could replace the word capitalism with new age, with self-help, and the idea would
still apply.
And then we come to the other concept, which is perhaps one of Lacan's deepest ideas,
where he famously said, desire full stop is always the desire of the other, which basically
means that we are always asking the other what he desires.
And this is where Jujak states in his book, but even in the video I just showed you, that
our desires, what we are supposed to do, living your best life, whatever it may be, don't
come in any authentic, spontaneous sense.
It always comes by the other, which is our sociosymbolic reality of culture, of society,
and it manifests in many ways.
It's true, of course, the very conspicuous marketing, celebrity culture, what not.
But even in more subtle ways, where it could be completely unconscious, nonetheless, our
desires are always coming to us from society.
Okay, so it seems like using these Lacanian ideas of psychoanalysis and Jujak's ideas
of more cultural analysis, we seem to be in quite a dilemma, given the fact that firstly
our superego demands of living your best life can never be met.
And the more you try, the guiltier you will feel.
And secondly, the fact that you realize that your desire is not some authentic desire of
you wanting to live your best life is never what you truly want, but rather it's what society
is telling you to want.
We seem to be stuck in a rather catch-22.
What do we do?
What's the solution here?
Now, the purpose of this video, like all my videos, is never to give any easy solutions,
nor is it to ever, ever, absolutely not give advice, because what the hell do I know?
But at least to end the video on a high note and not in a kind of cynical, defeatist note,
I could talk about a few things that Peter Rowland introduces to this conversation.
He too was, in fact, influenced heavily by Lacan and Jujak, but his kind of theological
understanding of what we can do, given that we, in many ways, need to try and liberate
ourselves from this culture of self-help and productivity and living your best life.
But before that, before talking about certain things we could do living amidst such a culture
and such a social reality, there's a caveat, a very important caveat that I need to put
forward, which is you cannot step outside of ideology.
Now, I've spoken about ideology quite a lot in this video, and especially post-modern
capitalist ideology.
Now, we could all think the way the androide people think, oh, that means now that I know
all these things, I could just step outside of ideology and get red-pilled and wake up
to the truth.
This is to quote Lacan himself, l'enum dupe air, which means those who are not duped
are a most.
To think that you can step out of ideology is the most ideological thing you could do.
So whenever someone tells you, here's the reality of our world, here's consumerism,
here's all the problems we're facing, come to me, I'll give you the solution that is
instantly ideology suspect, because the solution itself is a ideological reality, because we
can never step outside of ideology.
This is perhaps one of GDX's most original and perspicacious points that the only way
to live in such a reality is to understand that ideology itself is our socio-symbolic
reality that gives meaning to our lives.
So the only way to live in such a reality is to critique ideology from within, not to
think that you can step outside of ideology and to make this argument a bit more metaphysical
in the very famous Plato's Cave example.
The idea is not that you could step outside of the cave and then see reality, rather,
reality itself presents itself to you through the cave, and the way you understand reality
is through critique of ideology, in this case, critique of our social reality.
So with that caveat out of the way, here's one thing Peter Rowland suggests.
It is the idea of grace.
It's a very Christian concept, of course, and in such a culture, in such a culture of
self-help, such a culture of obsession with living your best life, one thing we can struggle
to do is, in fact, understand how grace works.
Grace is a unearned love, and you might think that, oh, unearned love is great, God's grace
is fantastic, but no, it's not just saying there's some abstract God out there loving
me, but rather learning in your social reality that you have the ability, the space, the
freedom, whatever you may call it, to accept love, to accept love from your friends, from
your family, and if you believe in God, from God himself, that it's okay to not fall into
achievement society and just simply, and to use a very, very cliched term, be the stupid
dumb self you are, and still find love in this world.
Find love in however way it may manifest, and this is, in fact, what the radical notion
of grace is, because grace, Christian grace particularly, is unearned love, and you might
think, oh, again, as I said before, that it's fine, I can enjoy unearned love, but no, keep
in mind that in our postmodern society, with all the superego imperatives of achieving,
of doing the best, of getting to the top, of being your best self, receiving anything
unearned is a traumatic, even traumatic experience, it is something we struggle a lot to feel
loved in this world and to accept love, but if we learn, and that's really important,
if we learn how to accept love and to accept grace, I believe to a certain extent this
can help us to live within such an ideological society with our current moral impositions
and superego imperatives.
And the second thing is, as much as we learn to receive love, we also learn to give love
and to love others.
Now, there are two ways I would put this, I could say, oh, of course it comes in interpersonal
relations, romantic love, loving your friends, loving your family, but I also think, and perhaps
it is quite important, given as Aristotle said, we are political animals, and he meant
that more in the sense that we are social animals in a social reality, not in the state
of today, silly, the spectacle of politics, he didn't mean that at all, given that we
are a part of society as much as society is out there, it's also within us, it's learning
to understand that it's important to have a vocation, it's important to have an existential
project in life, whatever it may be, you could be a writer, you could be a political activist,
you could be a scientist, an engineer, an entrepreneur, whatever it may be, it has to
be something that's an existential project, not something silly like a careerism or making
money, not playing the rat race and falling into the game of capitalism, certainly not,
but rather understanding that what you do in this world matters, not only to yourself,
but also to others.
And I think that in some sense, liberates us from this kind of narcissistic obsession
to live your best life and to always sub-actualize.
So yeah, that's at least for me, what's helped me to understand that I don't have to live
my best life, I could be the shitty stupid person I am, but at the same time, learn to
love, learn to accept love, but also to find a vocation and to commit myself to that cause,
to that vocation, and in fact, to go all the way.
Not to live this kind of tepid life of, oh I've got to meditate five hours a day, have
my cold shower, exercise, take all my vitamins and live this perfect, balanced, holistic
life.
None of that, none of that.
Do you understand that existence itself has an antagonism and chaos to it?
And that despite that, despite that chaos, or perhaps through it, I will learn to partake
in my vocation, partake in my existential project, while also understanding that the ultimate
guiding principle, the impetus behind all of it is love, and that is why I would say
Christian theology, the Christian idea of grace, certainly I would say is perhaps most
important for our culture than any other culture, when I mean our culture, I mean neoliberal
capitalist culture in the times we live in.
