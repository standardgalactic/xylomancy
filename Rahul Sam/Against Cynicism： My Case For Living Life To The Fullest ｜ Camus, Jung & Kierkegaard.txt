Hey everyone, so in the last couple of years I began to feel this sense of
cynicism and deep pessimism growing in our culture and I'd even say it started
coming into my personal and private life not at a philosophical abstract level
but really in my day-to-day intimate interactions and I started feeling that
viscerally and a part of me was like you got to give the devil his deal you know
I think you can't justify a certain level of cynicism in this world we live in
and that's what inspired this essay you know I write to think and for the
longest time I wrote for myself my private thoughts you know journaling
just taking down notes here and there and I think I finally mastered up the
confidence to start sharing my work publicly you know sharing my writing
publicly even though I tend to ramble a bit so I'm sort of plotting along and
trying to make sense of why I still think despite all the malevolence despite
all the cynicism that is that BCN is justified to a certain level that they
still a case to be made against it a case to be made for living life in the
fullest and deriving meaning out of the world we live in so anyway I hope you
enjoyed this essay it's actually a an essay I wrote for medium and my you know
personal blog and I'm reading it out because I do know that a lot of people
prefer listening or watching it instead of reading it part of it is obviously
subjective and personal to me but then I also think most of it is really something
that's applicable to all of us that's like an objective trip let's say but
yeah I'm keen to hear your thoughts I hope you enjoy it let's get to it now
against cynicism my case for living life to the fullest
to my partners annoyance I have a running joke I make at social gatherings
about wanting to have 10 kids one day enough to play a 515 basketball game I
tell myself the reason behind the joke is for some engaging befuddling humor to
lighten up the mood in a room even though it mostly leaves me having to
explain the joke awkwardly and even then most people do not find it funny yet
the more I think about it I feel as if this is something my heart truly desires
to have many kids probably not 10 and become a father someday hopefully a
good one as the adage goes there's a grain of truth in every joke but then I
think why would I want to do something that absurdly impractical when evidence
suggests that as people get more educated they tend to have fewer children
why would I want to go against the tide leaving aside the ridiculous number of
kids why even bring a child into this God for second world scourged by climate
change pandemics a lamentable economy and alarming social unrest how selfish
and cruel of us to inflict such inevitable misery onto another human
being by bringing them into this world and even worse what if my posterity
becomes totalitarian and deceitful tyrants who end up exacerbating the
agony of people I've heard people say that loving a child is sacrificial and
such selfless love is the highest of all virtues utter nonsense one could argue
as it looks to me that most people willingly have children leaving aside
the accidents only to overcome the soul-sucking banality of their life and
don't get me started on love sheer boredom drives us to find love it is a
self-centered facade of intimacy even the unconditional love of God is
conditional as he necessitates for repentance prior to our salvation if
God truly loved his children why couldn't he just forgive us instead of
sacrificing his own son for atonement most people deceive themselves of being
in love only when it's passion and their absolute inability to live with
themselves that trepidatiously hold together their relationship it's why
John Baptiste Clemens recognized in Albert Cannell's The Fall of course true
love is exceptional two or three times a century more or less the rest of the
time is vanity or boredom even if let's say love doesn't have to entail a
higher virtue over mere passion and all love necessitates is just that
passion alone is in passion itself a selfish pursuit suppose a man or a
woman audaciously follows their dreams and aspirations in that case it seems
like an awfully privileged position handed to them by society and most
people in the world wouldn't have that fortune some may even say aspiration is
for the spoil and I'm grateful desiring something more than being satisfied with
the life they're given as I've demonstrated about being cynical
towards life isn't difficult but the only question really worth asking is what
to do after we've rationalized our sense system that's what I try to deal
with in this essay a caveat questioning the answerable can leave us in a grim
place the angst it brings makes us bitter, misanthropic and implacable hence
it's not surprising that we intentionally repress these gratuitous
thoughts and cling to what the rest of society does with their lives the social
zeitgeist protects us from insanity it's more comforting to distract ourselves
with a political or celebrity scandal rather than looking into the festering
wounds in our own lives and reality itself at least for myself have it to
I have been rather fortunate in my life a lot of unearned good has come my way
mostly through those I love and yet these existential questions haunt me
despite my good luck I have spent countless nights trying to integrate my
serendipity with the world's unjust cruelty how dare I benefit from
unmerited happiness it's not gratitude I feel but a peculiar type of
consternation at life I swear you gentlemen that to be overly conscious is
a sickness a real tarot sickness Void√≥ Dostoevsky even while I'm writing this
piece I question my privilege and impertinence in asking such nonsensical
questions about love marriage and passion a part of myself is still yelling
at me go do some work hippie these aren't questions one should order asking
last year a friend of mine unexpectedly passed away she was a beautiful
soul her funeral was in Sri Lanka and I couldn't attend it because I live in
Australia I saw her wailing parents to the funeral livestream how cruel is the
caprice of life I thought and how arbitrary is the nature of suffering I
particularly remember her mom when I was growing up in Sri Lanka she was a
loving and kind lady what has she done to deserve such soul-crushing sorrow of
losing a child how could nature be so malignant my friend's death was a clear
rebuttal of how life ought to be as I was told parents aren't supposed to
bury their children but it ought to be the other way around I sit here in my
comfortable apartment typing and philosophizing away on my nifty computer
wondering if I dug myself into a hole too deep how privileged am I to dig this
hole of my own free will when my parents when my friends parents were pushed
into it by the faded tragedy of life however privilege or misfortune angst
or gratitude aren't justifiable reasons to evade and hide from such questions
we shouldn't give way to the pretense and at times distractions of mundane life
that we all use to cushion ourselves from the existential blows of living nor
should we neolistically succumb to fatalistic resentment both these forms
of living are out of cowardice once a question is asked not as a mere
utterance but as an authentic form of being itself and how we live
through our actions emotions words desires or whatever constitutes an
individual no reason we used to hide from such questions are adequate unless we
confront truth regardless of the consequences these questions will
enduringly haunt us forever every objection I brought up against children
or procreation marriage love passion and even God's salvation can be rebuked
through cogent arguments inferred from numerous intellectual propositions
and syllogisms a few ad hoc examples environmental activists Mike
Schellenberger makes a systematic case in his book
apocalypse never as to why we should be more optimistic about climate change
and not capitulate to anti-human sentiments such as not having children
because of the environment he emphasizes we should focus on humanitarian
development and elevating people from poverty as this has proven to be one
of the best remedies for imminent environmental problems the following
tweet thread succinctly highlights his worry about young people not wanting
to have children due to climate change I should stipulate that my intention
behind using Schellenberger's ideas as an example wasn't me taking a political
stance on the matter of climate change I stand neutral on the complicated
subject as I'm grossly uninformed about its nuances a big lie that pathologize
society since the 1960s with the publication of books such as the
population bomb is a myth of dangerous overpopulation that lead to global famine
and environmental catastrophe up till now these radical claims seem unsubstantiated
for instance Lehman stone from Vox states in his article why you shouldn't
obsess about overpopulation lowering US carbon intensity by about a third to
around the level of manufacturing superpower Germany today has a bigger
effect than preventing 100 million Americans from existing there's only
one way to effectively prevent alleviate or reverse dangerous climate change
technological geographic and social advancement population has little to
do with it especially not in the US despite the terrible consequences of
COVID-19 we also made unprecedented progress in epidemiology and
vaccination development while I'm not reducing the suffering people went
through due to the pandemic modern medicines expedition is a scientific
miracle we've seen in the last few months UCLA health reports in a remarkable
achievement of medical science we've gone from identifying a new pathogen to
discovering an immune response against it to developing and testing a safe and
effective vaccine for it in less than 12 months previously the fastest
vaccination to go from development to deployment was the month's vaccine in
the 1960s which took about four years all these developments were obviously
done by human beings therefore using the pandemic as an example we could
extrapolate the remedy to every other problem we face including social unrest
unfavorable economic conditions environmental issues etc the answers
lie in people the more talented people who come to live the most solutions we
will find through their skills looking through a pure utilitarian ethical
lens we need a bigger talent pool provided they have equal opportunity to
create more value in this world or crassly stating we need more people to
exploit more good from humanity for the world however pure talent alone is in
what makes an individual remarkable it's a combination of exceptional character
and innate ability in their respective attitudes therefore such excellence is
rare and the only way to increase our plane of serendipity is to increase the
number of human beings the individual being a central part of creation is an
unbelievably ancient ideal it runs deep into the mythology and stories that hold
our cultures specifically the western world together the individual is the
correct level of analysis as there is a fundamental truth that speaks to a human
being's sacredness and sublimity it speaks so deeply that we couldn't even
dare to question its validity for the longest time in human history it would
be considered sinful the book of Genesis explicitly stating Imago Day gold
created man in his own image is a proclamation of humanity being endowed
by the divine to bring forth a new reality into being the proposition of
Imago Day is a metaphysical problem that philosophers are still trying to
comprehend fully yet most modern societies are undergirded by the concept
of human rights which we invariably cannot violate even the most
abstruse and esoteric objections I put forward earlier about gold salvation has
been theologically dealt with by philosophers such as William Lane Craig
and Alvin Pantinger if you're interested in the subject Dr. Craig recently
wrote a whole book on the necessity for the death of Christ for humanity's sense
called atonement and the death of Christ and exegetical historical and
philosophical exploration additionally I could recommend books like Enlightenment
now by Stephen Pinker or the rational optimist by Matt Ridley where both
authors argue that humanity has made unprecedented progress in the last few
centuries they're confident we are on the right track in almost every available
measure for social and environmental progress in the past two centuries
providing ample evidence to ascertain their findings from various research
domains books such as these delineate that we don't have to look any further
for the miracle of human progress and advancement than our own history not
withstanding the conspicuous malvolence we see in humanity nevertheless none of
these intellectual arguments will satisfy the burdens of our souls at
least it didn't do so for mine I could find an infinite amount of philosophies
from every domain of thought known to human epistemology but still leave a
persisting void of despair in our hearts I know this to be certain as however much
science and philosophy intellectually stimulated me it was nothing compared to
the most intimate fulfillment that beauty valor and love brought to my soul
life is in another tried philosophical model instead the models are created in
trying to understand life itself we do not lead our lives by making a priori
decisions weighing the pros and cons similar to a machine learning model
that runs on a supervised set of rules for starters this would undeniably drive
us insane and most saliently at the least we do not even have a proper
phenomenological framework to deal with being we patently exist but this
existence is in the end itself the question lies in what this existence
for human beings entails the telos could life be a set of propositional
deductions masqueraded as choices or is that too simplistic this regarding
copious amounts of modern scientific research the research and a an ancient
wisdom found across cultures for a moment simple observation of regular life
will show that seldom do we let PO empiricism logic and cold rationalism
guide our lives nor am I sure if we should necessarily make rationalism the
highest of human virtues contrary to what the Enlightenment thinkers proclaimed
life can be more accurately portrayed through inspiration for man's
intuition serendipity synchronicity and all those bewildering elements of
reality that would be dismissed as superfluous occultism by modernist none
of these metaphysical or spiritual phenomena that still are meaningful
occurrences can be explained through the modern scientific method and
rationalism to make sense of those transcendent realities we need the arts
we need to revivify our fading appreciation for aesthetics as Oscar
Wild wrote paradox though it may seem and paradoxes are always dangerous
things it is nonetheless true that life imitates art far more than art imitates
life for example to elucidate my point I could use a grim philosophy called
antinatalism utilizing the work of its leading advocate in contemporary times
David Beniter the antinatalist position is that humans should be stained from
procreation because it's morally wrong to bring more children to this world and
would have and it would have been better for us to never have been born in the
first place professor Beniter asserts the following
presuppositional asymmetry between pleasure and pain which the whole
philosophy rests on number one the presence of pain is bad number two the
presence of pleasure is good number three the absence of pain is good even if
that pain is not enjoyed by anyone number four the absence of pleasure is not bad
unless they somebody for who this absence is a deprivation therefore if human
beings cease to exist it still fulfills point number three and four
theoretically Mr. Ridley David Beniter may seem like an evil person is
evidently anti-human ideas could be the same worldviews that motivated an
realistic school shooters and ruthless tyrants publicly unveiling the human
hearts innate malevolence I remember my emotional reaction to come across his
work how in the world could Oxford University Press even publish such a
reprehensible book yet as I delve into his work and the individual behind those
ideas I discovered a person who isn't much worse than the rest of us fools
he did not have an irrational hatred for humanity and he certainly wasn't
stating that people currently living should be wiped off the face of the
planet in farcical irony he dedicated his book better never to have been to his
progenitor stating to my parents even though they brought me into existence
Beniter is simply an academic philosopher putting forward a set of
ideas similar to what Socrates or the stoics have done historically his
assertion isn't particularly novel either it's something human beings always
wondered through a discussion that goes all the way to the book of Ecclesiastes
in the Old Testament and I declared that the dead who had already died are
happier than the living who are still alive but better than both is the one
who has never been born who has not seen the evil that is under the sun I'm not a
philosopher nor do I care for the sort of generative philosophy that acts only
in the plane of abstractions there's nothing more convenient than creating
asymmetries and inferring conclusions within a finite set of ad hoc roots
where we define the axioms I've lazily done that even in parts of this essay
it's what Albert Camel understood in the myth of Cessiphus which in my opinion
makes him a true and rare philosopher there is but one truly serious
philosophical problem and that is suicide judging whether life is or is not worth
living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy or
the rest whether or not the world has three dimensions whether the mind has
nine or twelve categories comes afterwards these are games one must first
answer and if it is true as nature claims that a philosopher to deserve our
respect must preach by example you can appreciate the importance of that reply
for it will proceed the definitive act these are facts the heart can feel yet
they call for careful study before they can become clear to the intellect was
Mike Tyson crassly said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the
mouth nevertheless despite my objections to conceptualizing life as a
philosophical model and prescribing a scatological judgments on living I will
engage in bentis example for expediency's sake but I will not engage as a
philosopher as I don't think the age-old question that was asked in Hamlet
Solakway is a philosophical one to be or not to be that is the question the
fundamental axiom in asymmetry between pain and pleasure presupposes one that
the presence of pain is bad and to the presence of pleasure is good I disagree
with this presupposition it isn't clear that life can be good only if it's
pain is entirely eliminated from be and all and all human beings had was
infinite bliss and pleasure nor does it seem like as Dostoevsky understood
human beings will desire such a mode of living one of my childhood heroes was
Lakshman Khadragama LK a Sri Lankan statesman and lawyer during his time as
the Minister of Foreign Affairs he was a key figure in Sri Lanka civil war
against the LTE a separatist service organization for example the independent
reported on his vitality for global politics Khadragama was not just any
senior minister he was the highest ranking ethnic Tamil in the government more
than that he was the man who was responsible more than anyone for drying
up international support for the Tamil Tigers the LTE it was his
international campaign that has a tiger's name as a banned terrorist
organization in the US UK and other countries similar to civil wars in any
other country Sri Lanka's conflict has a nuanced and complicated history and yet
most Sri Lankans would unequivocally agree LK was a national hero he was
posthumously awarded the highest national honor Sri Lanka Bhimanya a title
shared by Sir Atsi Clark in hindsight I believe my father giving me LK's
biography to read was the impetus behind my interest in studying politics ethics
and philosophy outstanding his profuse security and protection on August 12 2005
LK was assassinated by an LTE sniper in LK's biography his son Ragi states when
he was assassinated it was of course not a complete surprise part of me had been
expecting it for years his daughter Ajita concludes perhaps fate intervened
on the night of August 12 but chance he allowed it to in the knowledge that his
every move was being watched in the final analysis it is possible that Lakshman
Kaduragama chose to meet his death that night as a sniper sat there trigger
ready target in sight
Lakshman Kaduragama's life was a quintessential hero's journey in a way
he plays an archetypal role in my mind a true patriot that lived a life of
nobility who wrote in a French autograph book at the age of 14 how sweet and
honorable is it to die for one's country and still his biography doesn't depict
a life of bliss and pleasure without any pain instead a life of angst grief
strife and the tremendous weight of carrying the burden of a bloody and
ruthless ethnic conflict according to David Bennett's hypothesis LK's life
would be a bad one due to due to its inherent pain but most people would
agree that he lived a good life it'll be philosophically laborious or probably
impossible to reason and delineate this good but the purpose Lakshman Kaduragama
live for transcended all of his pain for the more his noble being created more
overall good for the world stories like LK's remind me that hypothetical
philosophical models will never explain life and reality we cannot create
arbitrary axioms of good and bad to justify a living it's impossible ever
to know all the consequences of living both good and bad intended or
unintended besides how dare I adjudicate if a potential future person was to be
born after a 30-year-old war that took over 100,000 lives what would have been
Sri Lanka's fate if Lakshman Kaduragama never came into being unanswerable yet
deeply moving question it's this impenetrable enigma and sublime
inexplicability of life that mandates are so lived as we'll never know if
life's worth living until we have all together and entirely lived it as one of
Soran Kedricar's journal say it is really true what philosophy tells us that
life must be understood backwards but with this one forgets the second
proposition that it must be lived forwards a proposition which the more it is
subjected to careful thought the more it ends up concluding precisely that life
at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood exactly exactly because
there is no single moment where time stops completely in order for me to take
the position to do this going backwards often shortened to life can only be
understood backwards but it must be lived forwards I'm a software engineer and a few
weeks ago I was having dinner at a steakhouse with one of my collegial
engineers we had a fascinating conversation that led us all the way from
discussing Roger Penrose's hypothesis on consciousness to me asking him made if I
may ask what does love mean to you he unhesitantly replied love gives me a
reason for eternity I thought deeply about this response only love has the
metamorphosing ability to turn an engineer who typically works in the
technical realm of logic and cold abstractions into a port and produce such
beautiful statement my fortune to fall in love with Shannon the most remarkable
woman who if my luck prevails I hope to marry someday has convinced me that love
is the most irrational, chaotic and incomprehensible force of being that
captivates our life like no other many have tried but no port or philosopher
could ever accurately portray what love means to a human being I think this may
be why the phrase goes I fell in love not I willed my way into love none of us
plan to fall in love it just happens love is unplanned yet timeless unbidden it's
yet yearnful a truth yet tangible so real yet meaningful and ultimately we
find a reason to live because of love alone this is why I think even Fitz
William Darcy had to go again societal standards and his own prejudice
judgment as love drove him to profess his feelings towards Elizabeth Bennett in
pride and prejudice in vain have I struggled if you'll not do my feelings
will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and
love you however even if love alone gives a reason to live this life still
worth living to the fullest even if the emotions evoked in us by love are good
and absolutely real does love justify doing anything that benefits oneself
like following one's passion marriage or having children firstly unless someone
can prove otherwise doing things that are beneficial and good for ourselves
isn't inherently selfish immoral or unjustifiable due to Eastern philosophies
influence with ideas like impermanence or non-self accentuated by rampant
materialism secularism and growing radical self-criticism within Western
culture Westerners have begun to feel guilty for their own being with the
loss of religion and consequently spirituality being jettisoned from the
cultural ethos Westerners feel their individual lives are a waste of space on
this planet or maybe even a pest brutally exploiting Gaia benevolent
mother nature dr. Carl you in all his brilliance and wisdom understood the
death of spirituality in 1957 and prophetically warned us of the ominous
signs in his essay the undiscovered self just as man as a social being cannot in
the long run exist without a tie to the community so the individual will never
find the real justification for his existence and his own spiritual and
moral autonomy anywhere except in an extra mundane principle capable of
relativizing the overpowering influence of external factors the individual who
is not anchored in gold can offer no resistance on his own resources to the
physical and moral landishments of the world for this he needs the evidence of
inner transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise
inevitable submersion in the mass therefore with such negation of the
individual self any act not serving the greater good but one self is looked
down upon by contemporary culture but we must ignore scornful societal
condescension and judgment as such nihilistic pessimism is futile and
serves no purpose but only breeds resentment suppose something we find
meaningful is good for us and this minimal harm nothing is entirely innocuous
to society in that case there's no good reason to not do that thing undertaking
such responsibility may even be a divine duty not withstanding our
consciousness of our own shortcomings and unworthiness
secondly a bizarre realization we eventually come to have about life is
that doing things not for ostensible virtue but genuine goodness that gives
us a real sense of meaning mutual mutually benefits both society and
ourselves getting married to a person we love begins a family one of society's
most foundational and imperative units for it to function even if it were for
entirely selfish reasons we decide to have a child let's say as a remedy for
trisinarian odum this act results in bringing forth a new life and every
human being is the epicenter of untapped potential and creation embarking on an
entrepreneurial artistic or sporting venture merely to live out one's passion
creates unforeseeable value in society and hopefully if done portfully even
benefits the planet symbiotically not just in the cliche capitalist tenor of
transactional value creation but even through those heavenly aspects of life
that cannot be commoditized I inspiration beauty elegance all and
wonder all of this goodness comes into being despite the inherent suffering and
malevolence inexorably present in life however if we cannot see the divine
ethos in this paradoxical miracle of being alive then nothing could stand up
to our neolithic and cruel judgment but what if we peel the onion one more
layer why be good why not wreck havoc in society and burn it all to the ground
it certainly creates circular reasoning to assert what must be good for the sake
of goodness fortunately for reasons I can't fathom
Abrahamic religions have a straightforward answer to this dilemma
and I'm yet to find a better explanation or a more truthful narrative than this
ancient story as it's an ultimate divine calling from God beginning with the
Old Testament we're told so God created mankind in his own image and the image of
God he created them male and female he created them Genesis 127 straddling to
the cumulative commandment by Jesus of Nazareth in the Gospels thou shall love
thy neighbor as thyself as many philosophers like Sartre and Dostoevsky
understood there's no God all is permitted the central stipulation of
this viewpoint is without a tangible moral absolute God specifically the
monotheistic God humanity is left in a moral miasma of ethical oblivion and a
volatile values framework it would be like trying to do theoretical physics
without mathematics William Lane Craig reasons accordingly in his apologetics
book on God to say that the Holocaust was objectively raw is to say that the
Holocaust was raw even though the Nazis who carried it out thought that it was
right and it and it would still have been drawn even if the Nazis had worn
World War two and succeeded in brainwashing or exterminating everybody
who disagreed with them so that everyone in the world thought that the Holocaust
was right and good to say that the Holocaust was objectively raw means
that it's wrong regardless of the outcomes of World War two the premise
is that if there's no gold then moral values or duties are not objective in
that sense and yet my unreasonable and rebellious heart is still unfulfilled I
don't think human divinity can be reduced to a sentence catchphrase
proposition philosophical stipulation commandment or low tenets could be
extrapolated from our understanding of divinity for pragmatic or
applicative sake I 10 commandments Magna Carta universal declaration of human
rights but instances of divinity don't encompass all of its truth they only
allude to its actuality our limited cognition knowledge and language gate
code and human divinity the moment it's instantiated for comprehension the
ultimate catch-22 a celestial provocation that's making our predicament
rather comical it's this absurdity of living that makes life both a tragedy
and comedy I see this quandary unfold in my life every day from the moment I
wake up in the morning sometimes I'm an atheistic relativists and other times
I'm a spiritual being piously carrying out my divine duty it's not that I don't
see the logical contradiction in this way of living I perfectly understand my
fully but it's the most accurate way I can portray my dilemma and I know I'm
not the only one maybe human beings created philosophy to deal with this
spontaneous morality driven mainly by emotions that emerge in life we need
coherent providence for cosmic forlorness from a cold and indifferent
universe nevertheless our salvation does not lie in a simple
postulation I am a Christian Muslim or Jew I'm a Buddhist or Hindu I'm an
atheist or skeptic etc we are too mercurial to be heralded by a mere
label I'll observe myself being bizarre by ruining a perfectly good week by
doing something that I hate which makes me miserable and self-loathing the label
I used to define my identity as unavailing and meaningless during these
times so I ask knowing exactly what or what not to do why does my it define my
conscience do otherwise it is naive to think we base our lives on a philosophical
proposition or some arbitrary religious or non-religious label ask yourself how
often do you do things you hate contemporary psychology may call this
self-destructive behavior but identifying its reality doesn't answer the
fundamental question why do human beings act out in this peculiar and
nonsensical way when we observe our lives in retrospect it seems clear that
rationality explains very little about our condition I'm yet to find a
quintessential rationalist even in my highly technical field of computer
science where people mainly deal with logical abstractions people remain true
to their nature I think this is why it's poignant to see modern society reduce
the human experience to pragmatic utilitarianism and carelessly disregard
any sense of the sublime therefore given that life resembles more a symphony or
story over an a priori culturalistic mechanism how do we deal with this
existential volatility at least for now I've concluded what's ultimately left
for us to do so take a Kierkegaardian leap of faith according to the Sanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy for Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a
matter of regurgitating church dogma it is a matter of individual subjective
passion which cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artifacts faith is
the most important task to be achieved by a human being because only on the
basis of faith does an individual have a chance to become a true self this self
is a lifebook which God judges for eternity it has taken me years to
understand what faith meant to human beings reading Kierkegaard at least
shed some light on the matter he uses Abraham from the book of Genesis and
the modifical night of faith in his book fear and trembling to expound how he
viewed faith people unable to bear the martyrdom unintelligently jump off the
pile and choose instead conveniently enough the world's admiration of their
proficiency the true night of faith is a witness never a teacher and in this
lies the deep humanity in him which is more word than this foolish concern for
others wheel and wall which is honored under the name of sympathy but which is
really nothing but vanity the true night of faith is always absolute isolation
the false night is sectarian this sectarianism is an attempt to leap away
from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap price
the tragic hero expresses the universal and sacrifices himself for it the
sectarian punch in yellow instead of that has a private theater IE several
good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the
Beatles in the golden snuff box represents justice the individual of
faith on the contrary is the paradox is the individual absolutely nothing but
the individual without connections or pretensions this is the terrible thing
which a sectarian mannequin can't endure for instead of learning from this
terror that he's not capable of performing the great deed and then
plainly admitting it an act which I cannot but approve because it is what I
do the mannequin thinks that by uniting with several other mannequins he will be
able to do it but that is quite out of the question in the world of spirit no
swindling is tolerated the narrow passage to go is a lonely journey it has to be
or else our faith is mine we can only have faith in our individual pilgrimage
and God when I first came across his philosophy I became depressed I only
used to term dramatically as an extra word that likes community and enjoys a
good conversation preferably over a fine steak and some whiskey I remember
thinking why does arguably the most important journey of our life the one
to God have to be a lonely endeavor but then I understood living in faith is a
state of being be embodied regardless of our public proclamations it is the only
real identity we incarnate that's unconditionally of our own will because
every other identity gender race sexuality class etc. is inescapably
feathered by society culture biology and the objective world there's only a
subjective spiritual journey that transcends every other material identity
given to us by simply being alive therefore refusing to accept our
divine adventures loneliness and trying to find it through social
institutions or the predominant cultural zeitgeist of our times will only
corrupt its essence and exacerbate our understandable nihilistic cynicism however
we must not misunderstand this journey to be a despondent one around the end of
2017 I experienced a somewhat miracle in life despite all my inadequate season
flaws I made a conscious choice to embody faith I started not to see the
transcendent as a distant deistic reality but rather to see divinity in
mundane life or the Christian parlance treat everyone as God's children and
everything as God's creation I learned that living on faith took courage most
people think it takes courage to face death it doesn't that is inevitable
what requires true courage is the will to live I still face the same trials and
tribulations of life I did in 2017 albeit I found love in 2018 and that's
redemptive to one soul but my choice my lonely leap of faith miraculously rid me
of nihilistic cynicism notwithstanding the malevolence and suffering in being
recognized every day I doubt I can argue against anti-natalism David Bennett has
the verbal virtuosity and intellectual prowess that I don't even remotely
possess and yet I know the best case I can make against anti-natalism is by how
I live the faith I choose to embody is the antidote to cynicism it's at least
the best I can do cynicism is the worst form of existence I doesn't help
anybody nor is it a remedy to anything it's need the pragmatic nor does it
answer the deepest grievances in the human heart a cynic doesn't want to live
nor die but only being a state of resentful non-existence a supercilious
refusal to partake in life being cynical is just cowardly a piece of animus and
unheroic reaction to life yes a lot can and probably will go wrong our
passions could be fruitless and lame every venture we start could end up in
failure and possible and possible ruin friends will disappoint us
unapologetically marriage could end in a bitter divorce our children might hate
us for a pathetic ineptness as parents love could break our heart we will
witness unjust suffering and we may even be partly responsible for us for its
subsistence during these lamentable moments helpless helplessness will
haunt our souls culture will turn eyes us and society will negate our
individuality nature will try to wipe us out of existence and there will be times
where we feel abandoned and alienated from a cold and dark universe apathetic
and indifferent to our feelings but somehow in spite of everything I said
it about living by faith vindicates all the ghastly anxiety-evoking horrors of
me I can only extrapolate from my journey in the last few years as that's
the only worthy story I can tell I found that faith allows the objective and
subjective to touch by revealing a phenomenological coherence to the
faithful it shows symphony in life and the drama that unfolds as we
paradoxically take part in it as both an audience and cast member faith shows
how every instance of being is meaningful both subjective then objectively
faith is the handmaiden of love so we're left with no recourse but we embody
faith undergirded by relentless courage in every moment of life we should not
think of it as a another distant and anachronistic religious ritual being
faithful is an act of bravery for what it's worth I can sincerely say that I
try to consciously exercise faith in every aspect of my life career relationships
family how I treat strangers and even software engineering I've learned its
paramount nature has to be the reason religion is primarily revealed to us
through faith as it amalgamates reality like no other I've humbled myself to
this trip it's what Kerkker got understood about the crucifixion of
Jesus as he writes in the sickness unto death the opposite of sin is not virtue
but faith
