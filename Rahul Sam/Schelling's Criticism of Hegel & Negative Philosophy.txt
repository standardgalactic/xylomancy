What I see from your white head and work, Matt, is that in contrast to, let's say, Peter
Rollins or even Jack, kind of the apophatic theology, it seems so much of their theology is
focused on negativity and probably makes sense given their Hegelians, the negative aspect of God
or like the self divided God. Whereas I do see, and it's in many ways, you know, in like our kind
of like postmodern kind of culture, this is a breath of fresh air that whitehead, he in fact,
he asserts, he puts forward a positive philosophy through especially the ideas of like creativity
and imagination, which is a big thing for you. So, well, what really is that kind of positive
orientation in whiteheadian process theology, would you say, in contrast to more of the kind
of the negative apophatic theology that we hear both from the the Jackians in our times?
I think, you know, it's very, I don't know if this is intentional on your part, or if you know
much about Shelling's positive philosophy, which was his late philosophical contribution at the
University of Berlin after Hegel's death, where, you know, this connects to process theology
and whiteheads work as well, where Shelling basically looked back at his own earlier work
and the work of Hegel and criticized it as a form of negative philosophy, which was merely
conceptual. And if it were to have been more upfront about the fact that it's merely conceptual,
it wouldn't be a problem. But he thinks, you know, he's very critical, in particular, of
Hegel's attempt to transition from the logic to the philosophy of nature, where there's there's
the sense in which the logic just freely releases itself into actual existence. And, you know,
Shelling just didn't see how one could make that transition from the process of negation by which
this dialectical logic could unfold to actual positive existence. And, you know, Kierkegaard was
at Shelling's late lectures, and many of Kierkegaard's critiques of Hegel come straight out of
Shelling's late criticisms. And what Shelling wanted to offer as a remedy to this situation,
because he admitted his own earlier philosophy, was also a negative philosophy in the sense that it,
you know, was relying too much on the conceptual activity of negation
in an attempt to derive actual knowledge, where what Shelling wanted to seek in his late philosophy
was a more existential relationship to actual existence. And he called it a kind of metaphysical
empiricism, where we're not so much concerned with what the structure, the conceptual structure of
reality is, we're more concerned with the fact that anything exists at all. And, you know,
he says that the fact that anything exists at all cannot be explained rationally would be his
claim, that there's something unprethinkable or un-oprioriable about just the sheer fact of
existence. And so, I mean, I think we can safely say that existentialism is kind of born in these
late lectures of Shelling's. And, you know, he also frames this as a kind of critique of feeling
Shelling does. And he says, he makes this interesting comment. I think I mentioned it in my book
about how Yakkant tried to do in his third critique, this examination, a transcendental
examination of feeling and esthesis and so on. But, you know, he didn't follow through fully,
and he discovered things in that final critique of judgment, as I said earlier, about the living
world, but also about aesthetics and our relationship to the sublime and so on, that in many ways
undermined some of the systematic claims he made in his first critique. And so, you know, Shelling
just drops this hint about that we still need a critique of feeling. And Whitehead later in
process in reality, I don't, I'm pretty sure, almost certain he didn't read these late lectures
of Shelling's. I know he had read at least some excerpts of Shelling's in a book by a Russian
philosopher named Velosky, so he was aware of Shelling. But he almost certainly didn't read
these late lectures on positive philosophy. But Whitehead says, again, in response to Kant,
that he wants to replace this critique of pure reason with a critique of pure feeling. And his
whole process philosophy is an attempt to do so. And he also says, you know, in the first critique
of pure reason, Kant has these 20 pages on the transcendental aesthetic, where he, you know,
articulates his view of space and time as forms of our own intuition. And Whitehead says,
his whole book should have been about that, and not just this quick little 20 page aside.
You mentioned crossing the threshold, yeah. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, and then
basically Whitehead's philosophy of organism in the final interpretation ends up being a lot like
absolute idealism in terms of the relationship between God and the world and the human,
human self consciousness and, and the divine. But he, as he himself puts it puts, he's putting
philosophy on a realistic basis instead of an idealistic basis, because he's not
doing philosophy in an attempt to build up this hierarchy of categories of thought, he says,
but rather a hierarchy of feeling. And wants to root our, our, all of our human knowing,
thinking activity and our, our knowledge in a kind of, I think of him as basically saying
that knowledge itself is a form of feeling. Our conceptual activity, conceptual prehension in
his terms, is a form of feeling just we're feeling possibilities rather than feeling actualities.
And so he wants to put reason and mind back in the world, back in the body,
and put the body back in the context of a living universe. And so in this context, you know,
positive philosophy is, is another way of thinking about this recharged form of empiricism.
Shelling called it metaphysical empiricism. William James, very influential for Whitehead,
called it radical empiricism, where it's not that Whitehead wasn't aware of the importance
of negation in the context of logical dialectics, but he, he accepts this pragmatist critique of
idealistic philosophy and really wants our concepts to be adequate to experience and
applicable to experience and, yeah, pragmatically useful. And like the, the test of any concept
for Whitehead is, well, what, to what extent does it elucidate our experience, including our
practical experience? So, yeah, hopefully, hopefully that gets at this question of the shift
from the negative to the positive. Most certainly does, most certainly does. And in fact, just to
answer your question, Matt, but I'm aware of Shelling's late lectures. The answer is no, because
my only education of Shelling is from Frederick Bizer, and this great guy on the internet called
footnotes of Plato. So, so I need to, I probably need to, well, do you know what those lectures
are called? I just, I just, I may just call Shelling's late lectures or? The grounding of
positive philosophy. I mean, so only, only, only some of those lectures have been translated up to
this point into English. I don't know if you read German. I'm working on it, but I don't, I don't
yet have the ability to really study the original. But SUNY State University of New York has published
a lot of Shelling's late lectures. And under the title, the grounding of positive philosophy,
Bruce Matthews is the translator. They've also, SUNY has published some of his philosophy of
mythology. I think it's under the title, the historical critical introduction to the philosophy
of mythology. And so that's what's available in English at this point. Yeah. And these, these
were all lectures he gave in the University of Berlin beginning in 1841, I believe. Yeah.
Excellent. Excellent. If I could find that, I'll leave a link down below in the description.
