Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the interval and podcast and
today I'm gonna read out guiding axiom number five which is a part of this
sub-series that I've been doing where I've been reading out these axioms that
I wrote for my newsletter the unhappy man links down below in the description and
as I was writing down these axioms I realized I'm in fact setting up a
framework for sounds like someone just got shot outside that's fine we don't
live in America this is really a people don't get shot here
back to it when I was laying down these axioms I realized that oh yeah this is
a framework for all of my creative work if it only makes sense to read them out
in this podcast given that this podcast is a part of my creative work I'm sorry
if that sounds pretentious and also it allows me to have a bit of structured
thinking and writing I think is the best way to do that today's axiom axiom number
five is undoubtedly my favorite one it's never fallen in love with your
suffering or well I said never fall in love with suffering as a category and
the reason it's important for me is because from all the axioms I've laid
down in many ways these axioms are an antidote to my flaws or things that I
see are shortcomings in my character be it morally spiritually existentially
whatever you want to call it and that's why I'm writing down these axioms so that
I don't let these shortcomings in my character of who am I as a person impact
the work I do and falling in love with suffering my god I am I'm kind of ashamed
how how vain it is when I really understood this concept thanks a lot to
Slavoj Zizek I think it's reading his stuff and listening to his lectures
they really influenced me as to why it's a bad idea to fall in love with
suffering and most of us subconsciously or unconsciously do this therefore it's
it's important to be cognizant of this phenomena without further ado enough of
a prelude let's get to the axiom so yes as I said it's the unhappy man guiding
axiom number five never fall in love with suffering and of course I've got
this painting by Goya this is an interesting one of Christ crucified
this is before I think he went through his face of depression but of course
suffering is very much connected to the archetypal story of the Western
collective unconscious let's say of the crucifixion that's why I decided to pick
this any kirkard guardian is familiar with the captivating admission in either
or my melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known what wonder then
that I love her in return most of us of the existentialist elk have fully
bought into the dogma of the depressed yet perspicacious philosopher for us all
great truths lack profundity if not written in a Schopenhauerian pessimism
about our condition the misery of existence is what those with great
intelligence and deep hearts have come to see to not see this verity is nothing
but naivety at least this is the bullshit we tell ourselves to be depressed or
suffer needlessly as far from the romantic beauty we give to it none of it
makes one so deeper and inspires philosophically penetrating poetry or
the staff skin literature in fact when I read my nonsensical journaling written
during the low points I see it as nothing but vain egotistical pabula which is
why I stopped journaling it's a waste of time and better drinking away your sorrows
this is a joke for now but beyond ostentatious vanity we all dwell with our misery purely to
feel something we often deliberately seek pathological relationships only because
the melodramatic pain of love reminds us of our humanness better to feel pain than nothing at all
OS Dostoevsky wrote if he human beings does not find means he will contrive
destruction and chaos will contrive suffering of all sorts only to gain his point notes from
underground and of course being willing to suffer through love particularly romantic
tells us of our goodness of our higher virtues and being authentically
self-sacrificial for another such as why Nietzsche wrote ultimately it is the desire
not the desire that we love your grand evil I must admit that I am ashamed of how pathetic we are
as a species having said that I see why modern people lust after suffering as we are given the
impossible choice of contrived pseudo happiness in the form of new age self-help which you all
know is rife with empty patitudes ie bullshit and the finger wagging pull yourself up by your
bootstraps heartless american stoicism it seems that we're stuck in this binary the modern age is
an era of nihilism so as Nietzsche the man who explored the symptom to his ultimate road read
from a distant planet the majestical script of our earthly existence would perhaps seduce the reader
to the conclusion that the earth was the ascetic planet park salons an outpost of discontented
arrogant and nasty creatures who harbored a deep disgust for themselves for the world for all life
and hurt themselves as much as possible out of pleasure and hurting probably their only pleasure
the passage above is from his cating critique of the ascetic ideal the mode of life he pillories
has little to do with religious asceticism but say but rather a cultural zeitgeist despite the
characteristic phenomenon being cross-cultural for instance he would be as equally contemptuous
of the contemporary postmodern stoicism of the ryan holy types or neoliberal western buddhism
that turns a blind eye to the problems of the world and decides to inflict suffering on oneself
for the pleasure of it i.e cold showers fasting crossfit etc irrespective of religious connotations
all such modes of being manifest a drive towards the ascetic ideal so his sentiments are apt to any
pseudo suffering we create purely to inject artificial meaning into our barren desolate veins
whether in the form of modern self-help cults with their unending self-flagellation or a morbid
romantic relationship that's conspicuously making everyone suffer we desire meaning perhaps the
intrinsic human reality is meaninglessness and the incompleteness of life therefore we ought to be
cognizant of how we respond to our predicament and one can only live authentically once this
datum is confronted in my view the only true antidote to meaninglessness or nihilism of our
culture is love but that's a whole other essay or book personal suffering on suffering as a
psychological phenomenon i find affinity with the zhezhekian sentiments on the matter footnote
influenced by zhak lakon's concept of joystones and the Freudian death drive zhezhek made the
following point in in his books and lectures paraphrasing don't fall in love with your suffering
never presume that your suffering is in itself proof of your authenticity renunciation of pleasure
can easily turn into pleasure of renunciation itself back to the essay pleasure never satiates
us as there's only so much of it one can enjoy therefore we seek the pleasure beyond pressure
and willfully suffer for an ostensibly noble cause but in reality this is our yearning to
fill the void in life we hope to overcome the abyss with the deepest spiritual meaning
sometimes with the touch of romanticism as we see in fascism that's elusive for us in the
technological age footnote read the question concerning technology essay by martin heidegger
to understand what this age entails when i mean this age i mean the current age we live in or the
technological age to be more specific i'll read that again that's elusive for us in the technological
age where to just have skis this may manage to become nothing but a piano key martyrdom for
instance typifies this drive within us despite the words etymology a martyr is not a purely
religious individual or some fundamentalist fanatic to a certain extent everyone sees themselves
as a martyr from a self-sacrificial parent and a serious employee working 15 hours a day at a
trendy postmodern startup to a nurse working in palliative care to the martin us the pain of
sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure when the so-called worldly pleasures generally a
derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate footnote pleasure which could be misunderstood
by how it's colloquially used in the carnal hedonic sense may not be the aptus term for this
instance but i've decided to stick with it since i'm speaking in fruity and nomenclature i'll reread
that sentence because i feel jumping to the footnotes tend to break the flow of things but i kind of
have to read out the footnotes because they are related to what i'm writing to the martyr in us
the pain of sacrifice and duty gives us that pleasure when the so-called worldly pleasures
generally a derided term but it shouldn't be are inadequate or as gk chesterton wrote pessimism is not
in being tired of evil but in being tired of good despair does not lie in being wary of suffering
but in being wary of joy the everlasting man of course none of this implies we shouldn't take
upon actual responsibility in life and carry the world's burdens nor does it mean above all that
love is free of a sword and fire alan bergeau observed this is in his book in praise of love
by the way uh it's a great little book that i've been recommending to many people it's it's a lovely
read reading that again alan bergeau observed that our culture is atypically in trying to sell a
safety first concept of love it is love comprehensively ensured against all risks you will have love
but we'll have assessed the perspective relationship so thoroughly we'll have selected the partner so
carefully by switching online by obtaining of course a photo details of his or her tastes date of
birth horoscope signs etc and putting it all in the mix you can tell yourself this is a risk-free
option but he fights back against such safetyism i'm convinced that love cannot be a gift given on
the basis of a complete lack of risk the mythic french online dating service approach reminds
me of the propaganda of the american army when promoting the idea of smart bombs and zero dead
wars in praise of love so we ought to pick up battles and be cognizant of the difference
between sacrifice for higher life-sustaining ideals of love justice etc that bring forth
genuine good and on the other hand suffering for the love of suffering itself the latter is
nothing but vanity and exhibitionism any blind renunciation of pleasure and seeking of suffering
becomes a kind of machiavellian narcissism worse than what you'd see from a typical more explicit
trump-like narcissist as a former is the ultimate wolf in cheap's clothing ergo as jujek candidly
tells us never fall in love with your suffering suffering as a category but i'd go a step further
and assert never fall in love with suffering as a category period firstly because it's simply
un-pragmatic suffering doesn't make anyone's life better and has no ennobling qualities in itself
secondly and more importantly the fixation of suffering has imbued unspeakable amounts of evil
kiss in point i'm disgusted by how post-modern neoliberals that's most of us fetishize poverty
we implicitly believe there's some deep found wisdom in the suffering of the poor that those
exploited in the mecca mines in india for extortionate makeup products have a profundity to their
souls that we degenerate westerners have lost or we would salivatingly cite an outdated statistic
about bangladeshi people being happier than rich americans footnote who says happiness is the purpose
of life or that it's even something worth measuring it doesn't matter that they're happier if the
rapacious fashion industry aloves for tragedies like the rana plaza collapse in such moments
happiness is an unethical category it's out of the question but isn't all of this romanicization
of poverty utter nonsense isn't it yet another example of the aforementioned suffering fetish
this time despicably manifested in the political domain i doubt any of us unpretentiously listen
to a poor person except through an ideological lens which tells us what to hear over what the
person's truly saying personally whenever i've spoken to someone struggling to survive and barely
making ends meet i see nothing but despondency pain and resentment not the pristine goodness in the
souls of poor folk would prescribe on them not the wisdom of the heart we'd read about in a
charles dickens novel of course dickens knew this better than all of us i partially blame the
misappropriation of the crucifixion for the fetishism of suffering i'm not surprised as someone
deeply enamored by christ the crucifixion is an infinite superhistorical event happening in the
eternal now footnote i borrowed his term from poldtelics book eternal now which encapsulate
most of his superlative theology i highly recommend that book he probably gives the
best description of god that i've ever read in my life and i think he's right he's correct to
describe god as the ground of old being actually i say meditating on it has changed my life or more
accurately given me a new one and i shall expound on the matter in later essays in any case
crucified christ is only part of the christian narrative and we replace the whole with a fragment
at great peril we ought to never forget christ also resurrected as bizarre as that sounds not
withstanding one's religious beliefs be it the atheist or spiritual but not religious all of us
think of ourselves as a suffering christ carrying a cross footnote to understand why i recommend
starting with tom holland's dominion and slavo jugex fragile absolutes because as don kupid wrote
nobody in the west can be holy non christian you make hold yourself non christian but the
dreams you dream are still christian dreams since we even migrants to the west like myself dream
in christianity we ought to never rush into glamorizing the suffering christ and instead
be searingly skeptical of our underlying humanistic intentions behind the veneer of self-sacrificial
love perhaps christ was thinking my dad's a malevolent sedomasticistic son of a bitch who's
thrown me into gratuitous suffering because of a twisted cosmic jurisprudential atonement he's
conjured up ex nihilo at least this is what theologians like william lane craig tell us
if christ was the gold man then for him to say ally ally lama sabustani my god my god why have
he forsaken me is an unsurprising remark for one to make while being crucified and here as jugex
points out momentarily god himself becomes an atheist it's the negation and even hatred of god
e.g. book of job that makes christianity unique from any other religion and makes our culture
outlandish footnote martin's cossessy's silence explores this phenomenon well with the modern
flavor of man's helpless frustration at god and gk chesterton's orthodoxy encapsulates his idea
best from any modern theology i've ever read we see in christianity the utmost palpable story of
existence human suffering can be so unbearable that even god once he comes down to us realizes
he can't bear it and loses faith ergo the separation from god is a part of divinity itself
and it's only the christian god that knows the alienation of being human i go on these detours
only to explicate my view that suffering in itself has no higher soul maturing virtue
we don't have to artificially create and fetishize it as pain tragedy and our happiness are already
concomitant with the vicissitudes of life so despite this newsletter being called the unhappy man
i shall never fall in love with unhappiness and suffering if i ever do i will stop writing
thanks for watching as i said the link to this uh essay is down below in the description if you
do prefer reading it please do check it out but i shall see you in the next one cheers
