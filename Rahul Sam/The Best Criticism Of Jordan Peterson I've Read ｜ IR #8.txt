Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the Interrelant podcast.
I've got to say, I'm in a really good mood today because I just sat for the AWS developer
associate examination and passed it.
So I'm feeling good.
It's always a good feeling to, you know, work towards something and then kind of achieve
it.
And well, I guess now what?
Back to the meaninglessness of life.
In any case, this is kind of an interesting episode because the previous episode I did
a few weeks ago was my first ever book review.
And I think this is going to be the first ever article, article or let's say essay commentary.
And it's going to be on the piece that David Dunyong, I really hope I pronounce your surname
right.
David, apologies.
I mean, no disrespect.
It's going to be on the polemical piece that David wrote on Jordan Peterson.
And frankly, from everything I've read on Jordan Peterson, you know, I think today this
is the best criticism I've read of him in a very deep sense, not in like a superficial,
you know, I don't know, the kind of the what like corporate media does.
So dismissive, calling him a French far right, whatever.
But I really thought David's criticism was very apt to the current situation, but also
just philosophical it was quite deep and he made a lot of sense.
And he's a great writer.
I only hope to write like David one day.
Now I've got to say, of course, as I said, this piece is a polemic and and like myself,
unlike myself, David is very, very critical of Peterson and doesn't like him at all.
I personally do like Jordan Peterson quite a lot.
I've been influenced by him, especially I'd say when I was about 20, 21, this is like
around 2016.
I started watching his lectures early on and I really enjoyed his lectures.
I still very much enjoy the lectures he did on psychologists, like, for example, I think
my best learning on John P.J. was through Jordan Peterson.
I'd even say Jordan Peterson was the person who introduced me to Heidegger a couple of
years ago, even though, you know, Peterson doesn't really go into Heidegger's philosophy
kind of he lectures on him through like a psychological lens.
In any case, the point that I make is that I really like Jordan Peterson and that's exactly
the reason I think it's important for me to make this episode and record this.
And I'm now getting to more as to why that is later on.
So firstly, I want to put a quick caveat as I tend to do with these episodes.
I will truly try and keep away from the day-to-day politics or contemporary issues Peterson gets
himself involved in.
He tends to do that from time to time.
I think he kind of likes it.
Let's be honest.
He likes the attention.
You know, I mean, I love the doc, but he loves the attention he gets.
But rather in David's paper, I'm going to focus on the philosophical critiques.
Oh, I didn't mention this.
The way how I came across this was actually through David's YouTube channel, Theory and
Philosophy, which I'd say now at this point in my life is my greatest source of learning
when it comes to philosophy and theory, especially being a software engineer, having no background
in arts or the humanities.
I studied computer science.
I didn't even know how to study or learn about all these different theories and philosophies
because I never had any proper formal academic training.
Even though I deeply love the humanities, I really appreciate it.
It means a lot to me.
I spend so much of my time trying to understand it and, you know, read philosophy and literature
and all of that.
So I'd say this point in my life without a question, man, David's YouTube channel is
one of my greatest sources of learning.
It's a great resource really to go through.
Literally any book, I'll go through some of the stuff he did later on.
Recently I went through his Kant, a critic of pure recent series.
My favorite banan was the one he did on Hannah Arendt.
My God, such a good series, David, really.
You just have an amazing ability.
You're so eloquent.
Also, I like that you speak with no pretension, which I appreciate as a layperson or as a
neophyte.
So, sorry, I'm kind of all over the place, but in the program, I want to state, as I
said, I try to stick to more of the philosophical critiques, more of the ideological critiques
and not get too enravelled in the kind of day-to-day fleeting politics, let's say.
And of course, as I said, I'm a big fan of Peterson.
I also like some of the figures in the Intellectual Dark Web, and that begs the question, why should
we be skeptical and question these public intellectuals, people like Sam Harris, Jordan
Peterson, Brett Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, oh God, Harvey Weinstein.
That's funny, what's Brett's brother's name, Eric Weinstein, we should definitely question
Harvey Weinstein.
All right, that was an intentional, that was just a mistake.
In any case, all these people in the Intellectual Dark Web, why we should question them, and
I think the reason is because firstly, personally, whenever I feel that the narratives that people
give out to the world, or the philosophies people propagate and advocate for, let's say,
when they're too coherent, when they're too, let's say, when they're too much of a salvation,
when they're too redemptive, or when they're too, this is it, we've got the absolute philosophy,
we've got the absolute ideology to make something work.
I generally take a step back and I become a bit skeptical, because for me, you know,
in many ways I'm an absurdist, so there really isn't the kind of coherence that a lot of
the people in the Intellectual Dark Web would like to portray.
And it's actually a point David gets to in his article, which is what I really liked.
So I think whenever we feel like we're getting easy answers, easy solutions, or not even
easy really, but the kind of solutions that seem straightforward without any deeper introspection
and deeper inspection into it, I think we should be skeptical of those kind of solutions.
And I would say, speaking personally, around two or three years ago, when I really started
to like Jordan Peterson, I realized that I was liking him a bit too much, almost to the
level of obsequiousness.
And that was definitely unhealthy, because I realized, wow, I can't even read an honest
criticism of his work without taking it personally, as if he's some of my personal savior or
whatever.
And that's when I truly wanted to only again treat Jordan Peterson as a person who influences
me, but not as the only point of influence or like this kind of he's in Christ to put
it in a dramatic way.
And that's when I started questioning him a bit more and looking for points of view that
differ from him points of view that, you know, he's completely a versatile, let's say, and
I realized, oh, wow, I actually completely disagree or predominantly with most of his
points.
I disagree with his politics and even his underlying philosophy, despite and his interesting thing,
despite truly starting to admire and like him as a person, as an individual, as a teacher
and as a psychologist, like I still find his work on psychology to be brilliant.
I think he's a great psychologist, even though I think he's got his politics and his philosophy
and I see a lot of loopholes with his worldview.
And as a person, you know, I've got to say, again, one, one never, one never knows, especially
with public figures, how they portrayed themselves in public, you know, that kind of distinction
between private life and the person, between personal life and the public life.
Peterson looks like a genuine person to me.
He looks sincere.
And I'm, you know, speaking purely personally, I'm the kind of person that appreciates family
and having a good relationship with your significant other, your wife, your spouse, whatever, your
children.
And I find that he's got that kind of relationship and it seems just that that true love of a
family and I appreciate anyone who can foster that and who can have that in life because
that certainly takes work.
So yeah, those are the points of the preamble and that of course leads me to this point
and I wasn't even going to put this part in the episode, but I realized that actually
maybe it's something I should talk about before I get to the article itself.
I still don't know if David steelman or strawman Peterson's arguments.
I don't know if he mischaracterized him and whether he, how he portrayed Peterson's oppositions
to build C16.
Got to keep in mind, David too is a philosophy student.
I think he's doing a PhD in philosophy, he's an art student.
So, you know, I don't want to make an argument from authority, but I do think someone who's
taken the time to go and study theory and go and study philosophy in academia, I sell
whole academia and higher regard contrary to most people on the internet.
And I would say a person like that probably has a better understanding of some of the intricacies
of these, these debates when it comes to, you know, free speech pronouns or all the different
fragments that are connected in the whole bill C16 controversy.
So I didn't get the impression that David was trying to mischaracterize Peterson.
But also that's the one, a reason for that is because sometimes Peterson himself isn't
coherent with what his arguments are in his opposition to bill C16.
He will say it's a purely free speech issue.
But then you can see from some of the interviews, which is the interview that I'm going to play
right now, that it's no, no, it's, it's not just a free speech issue.
He's got an issue with the gender identification too.
So without me, you know, putting words in his mouth, let's listen to this short clip that
I found on Majid Nawaz's show where, I mean, this was in 2018.
So a bit, a bit after the whole controversy broke out.
And, and, you know, I think this is the most, this is the shortest clip I could find where
Peterson lays down his points, kind of enumerates all his points as to why he opposes bill C16.
So let's take a look.
Bill C16 purported to do nothing but extend human rights provisions to an excluded group,
let's say, to the transgender and non-gender binary types.
And that was the federal legislation.
It also made it a hate crime to, to, to discriminate or harass essentially.
So now then the question is, well, what exactly do you mean by discriminate or harass?
And why exactly is that a hate crime under the criminal code?
Well, there was an answer to that.
The answer was, well, this bill will be interpreted in light of the policies generated by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission, very large set of policies.
Now the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a radically leftist organization.
I think it's the most dangerous organization in Canada, although you could debate that.
Of course, I've got to make a comment.
So I, I'm going to make comments in the middle of what he's saying.
I mean, if you want to watch the whole thing without me interrupting, just going to watch
the original video.
But you see, this is, this is another thing about Peter says, as much as I like him, you
know, when he makes a statement, such a blatant statement that the Ontario Human, Human Rights
Commission is the most dangerous organization in all of Canada.
That's where, you know, touching on my earlier point, one should take a step back and, oh,
is it really?
Like, what, what, what does he mean by that?
The most dangerous or that's, that's, that's quite a leap to call an organization, the
most dangerous organization in all of Canada.
This is where I think we should pause the video because it's normally on YouTube that
he's popular and actually think and not let him, but I mean him, I mean, Peterson or anyone
for that matter, do the thinking for us.
So back to the video.
Debate that.
And they said all sorts of policies about how this, these led, this legislation was going
to be interpreted.
And the federal government linked to their website to state that Bill 16 C 16 would be
interpreted in light of those guidelines.
So I went and read all the policies.
Well, one of the policies was that if you didn't use the preferred pronouns of a given
group, that you could be charged essentially with a hate crime.
And I thought, no, that's given up, talking about transgender people.
Yeah.
And so there's all these pronouns that have come up.
There's 70 different sets of pronouns approximately to, to hypothetically describe people who
don't fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, which is also something that I don't really
understand.
I don't understand that conceptually.
Like, we'll come to that, but the point is, well, okay, so now I'm a person is compelled
under Canadian law to use the pronoun of another individual's choice by on pain of law.
And I thought, well, no, that's not acceptable.
It's one thing to put limits on what a person can't say, like say with hate speech laws,
which I also don't agree with, by the way, but that's a different argument.
I think it's a narrower argument.
But to compel me to use a certain content when I'm formulating my thoughts or my actions
under threat of legislative action, I thought, no, what's happened there is the government
has introduced compelled speech legislation into the private sphere.
It's never happened in the history of English common law.
And so I said, there's no way I'm abiding by that.
I don't care what your damn rationale is.
We're compassionate.
It's like, no, you're not.
No, you're not.
You're playing this radical collectivist left wing game.
You're trying to gain linguistic, you're trying to gain linguistic supremacy in the, in the
area of public discourse.
You're doing that using compassion as a guise and you're pulling the wool over people's
eyes and you're not going to do it with me.
If I was sitting here in front of you as a chat, transgendered male to female or female
to male, and we began the conversation at the beginning of the conversation, you stumbled
and called me he or she, and I was perhaps identifying the other way around.
And then if I'd said to you, please, I'd rather go by she, how would you respond to that on
a personal level?
How would you?
Well, it would depend on the situation, but the way I have responded to that, because
I've had a number of conversations with transgendered individuals is that I use whatever pronoun
seems to go along with the persona that they're projecting publicly.
It's the simplest thing to do.
Now, if we were, if you would respect their choice on an individual level, yeah, yeah.
But with a, with a, with a more, uh, contentious pronouns, g and jur, and that sort of thing,
that's a whole different issue.
Because the question there is, well, exactly what is it that you're doing when you're asking
me to use those words?
Like are you, are you compelling me to play your particular ideological game, or is this
actually a matter of some personal identity that's important to you?
And those things are not obvious.
And so in a, in a, in a situation like that, the first thing I'd have to do is to try to
figure out just exactly what was going on in the situation.
And that's not simple.
And so there would be no foregone conclusion that I would address you by the pronouns of
your choice.
And the first thing I'd want to find out is, is that just a narcissistic power play?
Because that's actually the most likely outcome.
I don't know if that's the most likely outcome.
And you know, Peterson does make a good point, like again, there are manipulative, almost
psychopathic narcissists in this world who want to manipulate people and play power games.
So that certainly is the case.
But again, this is, okay, so I've got a few points to make on what Peterson just said.
On what Majid Nawaz said about, on a personal level, that's an important word he is, personal.
I think a lot of this comes down to that, it comes down to those interpersonal relations
and how we treat each other.
We can't bureaucratize it even though I feel like modern society is trying to, in many
ways, everything is abstracted out into the ether, into the bureaucracy, into the Kafkaist
bureaucracy and then even things that are so intimate and so personal, modernity is
bureaucratizing it.
And it's kind of unfortunate because a lot of this, which should be dealt at an individual
level is trying to be dealt with loads and policies, which frankly, I don't think works.
I don't, firstly, it's not authentic.
And secondly, this practically, I think it fails.
And then on the point Peterson makes about what kind of game you're playing.
So you can clearly see that for him, it's not just a free speech issue, it's a gender
issue display effect that he also is particularly averse to people who are, let's say gender
fluid or people who are non-binary.
You can see that he doesn't click for him.
He can't comprehend what that means.
And fair enough, I mean, to a certain extent, I never really had a problem with the whole
gender fluid thing.
I always felt deep down in a very visceral sense that, yeah, gender certainly doesn't
seem something that's binary.
It doesn't seem like something that's fixed.
In fact, I don't think human nature is fixed.
I think human nature is way more dynamic than we think.
It's a lot more deeper than what in modernity, the post-enlightenment era, we would like
to put everything in comfortable boxes.
It's a human nature a lot more deeper than that, in my opinion.
David kind of touches on that in his article too.
But also, his thing about, see, this is where again, I don't know whether Peterson does
a good job in how he articulates his points, because it seems a bit vitriolic or it seems
a bit hateful the way he talks about non-binary people.
Again, you know, these are just, I'm just touching on my intuitions.
I'm not saying this is exactly what he's saying, not at all.
You know, when he says are non-binary people playing some kind of narcissistic power player
or trying to manipulate other people, personally, from my experience, I've actually only really
got one non-binary friend, because all of my other friends are transgender, which means
all the other friends in the LGBTQ community, I mean, which means, you know, they still
identify just by the opposite gender, not the one that was assigned there.
But then, you know, that's fine.
And some of them, one of them actually, I don't even know until she told me.
In any case, the non-binary people, yeah, it is a bit odd.
I'm going to be totally honest, referring someone as they, but this person that I do
know, in no way did I get the impression that this person was playing some kind of game
or this person was trying to manipulate me to, you know, as Peterson says, trying to
control my linguistic territory.
I didn't get that impression at all.
And if I did, I wouldn't be that person's friend.
I wouldn't associate that person simple as that.
And I think person generally didn't feel like a man or a woman or felt non-binary,
whatever that means.
I don't know what that means, because I don't feel like that.
And that's something we've got to learn about human, you know, about life itself,
that in some sense, you know, this is apocryphally attributed to character God.
But, you know, when you label me, you negate me, I think it comes from this
character God's idea that in many ways, that deep inanness, that subjectivity of
being human, that it can never be quantified.
It can never be properly betrayed or abstracted out from the individual.
No one will ever know what it feels like to be me, nor will I ever know what it
feels like to be some other specific individual.
Not an abstract humanity, no, no, no, a specific individual.
And that's, for me, you know, my thinking has been heavily influenced by character
God in that way.
And, you know, far enough, Peterson too, you know, talks a lot about character God.
So, saying all that with that long preamble, good Lord, it's 20 minutes
already and I haven't even got to David's article yet.
Let's discuss David's piece.
The article is titled, Jordan Peterson and the flow of scientific inquiry.
A critical evaluation of Peterson's use of science and philosophy in his
conquest against social justice by David Gagnon.
Again, I'm so sorry if I got to say them wrong, David.
I truly mean no disrespect.
So the article starts off by two quotes by Baudrillard and Nietzsche.
And I always want to say, I only knew of Baudrillard as his name in the
French intellectual circles.
It's because of David that I've actually truly kind of delved into his work a
bit more and started to understand him.
So, okay.
And as I said, David's YouTube channel has had, has had, what kind of speak?
David's YouTube channel has had a massive influence on me in the past years.
So I, so I'm truly grateful for that, David.
And then, okay, back to the article.
If all enigmas are resolved, the stars go out.
If everything's secret is returned to the visible, if all illusion is returned
to transparent, then heaven becomes, become indifferent to the earth.
Jean Baudrillard.
What is the purpose?
And worst still, what is the origin of all science?
What?
Is scientific method perhaps no more than fear of and flight from pessimism?
A cycle of defense against truth?
Or to put it in moral terms, is it something like cowardice and insincerity?
To put it immorally, is it a form of cunning?
Oh, Socrates, Socrates, was that perhaps your secret?
Oh, mysterious ironies versus perhaps your irony, Frederick Nietzsche.
David starts off the article saying, this article argues that Peterson's challenge
to postmodern port as an anti-scientific doctrine is perplexing, given the general,
general lack of consensus between his views and those of the greater scientific community.
The article presents different theoretical frameworks attesting to the reality of gender
non-conforming identities, as well as to the consequences of denying these identities.
And argues that rather than challenging oppressive systems of governance, Peterson's
project actually mirrors them.
So pretty much the article breaks down JB's project into three broad conceptual domains.
The three of them are the first ones arguments about postmodernism.
So Peterson's averseness against postmodernism and how he portrays postmodernism.
And of course, the most interesting part in my opinion that I had, I learned a lot from
this part really, the part where David touches on the scientific discourse, truth and objectivity.
Brilliant, brilliant section of the article.
And the other part is the more of the political part, let's say, on gender identity.
Now, I'll focus on the latter, sorry, I'll focus on the former, the arguments about
postmodernism and the scientific discourse, truth and objectivity parts over the latter,
which is the gender identity part, simply because for me, I don't know if I'm speaking
from a position of privilege here, but I didn't really care too much about the whole gender
identity issue, because it didn't really personally affect me.
And even in this article, that was the part that I sort of, I did read it a couple of times for
this video, but just skimmed over, it didn't really speak to me in a deeper sense.
But certainly the poems David make are quite interesting, especially when he speaks of
Judith Butler and Poetryard.
I'm going to get to that part a bit later, but I do recommend reading the whole thing,
of course, because unlike a book, this is an article, so you could just read it in one sitting.
David David states, this article presents counter arguments and evidence that destabilized
the facile deployment of a scientific rationality by Peterson and his allies, and therefore
caused into question many of his central claims.
This paper moves through each of these domains methodically, beginning with his juxtaposition
of postmodernism with neo-Marxism, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to
Frederick Nietzsche.
That point there, all the while claiming to be a faithful reader to Frederick Nietzsche is an
important one, because maybe I'll get to that later on in detail.
But if someone listens to Peterson's lectures, and then gets this impression of who Nietzsche is,
and then actually reads Nietzsche, in my opinion, at least, it's a completely different.
So the contradiction is very evident, because the actual Nietzsche is very much different
to the kind of Nietzsche-Petersen portrays, in my opinion.
So that's an important one.
And I thought that was a good point David raised in this article.
This is something I started feeling about two years ago when I actually started reading
Nietzsche's work, especially the gay science and the anger and evil.
So anyway, that's an interesting thing to think about.
Of course, I also found there's a problem with Peterson sort of prima facie associating
postmodernism with totalitarianism.
And I think David, again, brings this point to Salience, too.
And furthermore, the kind of the incommensurability between neo-Marxism, which is a metanarrative
and postmodernism, you know, David asks, is it true that postmodernism is merely a clever
Marxist side of hand seeking like its Marxist predecessor to undermine the West?
Well, again, if you listen to Peterson, that's the impression you get.
But if you do a bit more excavating into, let's say, the over of postmodern
philosophy and literature, which is virtually an impossible task, because there's so much,
you might get a different impression.
But even if you read the, let's say, the well known postmodernist or the kind of the postmodernist
Peterson talks about like Derrida and Foucault, you'd find that, oh, actually, no,
you know, it's not easy to just pinpoint them as Marxists.
I mean, Foucault was an anarchist, for God's sake.
And then this is, again, is a good point.
I've spoken about this before in my previous episodes, and David certainly puts in a much
more articulate and eloquent manner than I have ever done.
Scientific rationality is fragile, and we can unequivocally place faith on the science.
I'm putting it in quotes because the science is a very, it's a term with a lot of back age,
the science.
We can't put this kind of faith of science being universal,
a historical, a cultural, and most certainly when we take the scientific
institution, we can't derive social values from it.
That's a good point David makes using Baudrillard.
And I was thinking about this recently, the intellectual dark web, Peterson, all these,
I mean, I know the intellectual dark web doesn't really exist anymore, but people,
you know, from that elk would agree with this statement, I think, especially with what
happened with COVID, because most of them were involved with all these controversies
regarding the lockdowns as in the midst of COVID, the lockdowns, the vaccinations.
And they would agree that, you know, science isn't this entity, let's say, that you could
just detach or science isn't this thing that can just plainly be detached from the rest
of society and from our, from our, let's say, our perspectives.
I don't know if anything really being a human being, you know, this is again, Nietzsche's
perspectivism, being a human being, I don't know if you can really detach anything from
a perspective. So from a, from the context, from a social context, and this again is
something I've truly begun to appreciate about postmodernist, that kind of skepticism, even
though I understand that can easily become cynicism.
And that certainly isn't what I'm trying to do here, even though maybe sometimes in this
article, David has become a bit cynical, but that's fine.
I like, you know, we all can become, life is tough, being cynical sometimes is warranted.
So the section that we're going to get to right now is the incommensurability of Marxism
and postmodernism.
The point David makes is simply it's wrong to claim postmodernists are Marxists in disguise.
It's too simplistic and it's a lazy argument.
And David points it out in this article.
Clare Hemmings problem, problematizes this approach to postmodernism and Marxism by
emphasizing some of the most significant differences between the two theoretical frameworks.
She writes that postmodernism's attention to complexity of meaning and interpretation
distracted us from the most substantive concerns with inequality, experience, political
economy and justice that Marxism attends to.
Hemmings extends this analysis by suggesting that without a Marxist or other tangible
approach to critical theory, we remain powerless to alter the pernicious power relations.
Our poststructuralist tactics can cleverly identify, but spectacularly fail to transform.
Hemmings's point stresses the lack of consistency between Marxist and poststructuralist theories
demonstrating that their fundamental incongruency in the domain of political action with the
former emphasizing a radical transformation of capitalism into a socialist system and the
latter belonging to the domain of theory interested in the immaterial conditions of signification.
What I got from this paragraph really was, you know, in a very colloquial sense, let's say,
Marxism is predominantly a chord to political and social action.
You know, that's what the communist manifesto is pretty much is, is even though I'm not
reducing Marxism just to the communist manifesto, certainly not.
But it seems clear to me at least as a, again, a layperson on your side, that Marxism is
clearly a chord to action.
Anyone who, in my opinion, is a Marxist is sort of, is concomitantly an activist.
There's no, in my opinion, these come together, the couple, let's say.
Whereas postmodernism and poststructuralism is very much a theory.
It's against what, you know, Clare Hemmings writes about, identifies here of it being, you
know, the importance of context, the depths and layers of meaning, all of that.
So it's, you know, breaking down language.
So it is different.
One can't just, again, as I said, prima facie attribute a postmodernist to also be a
Marxist or put it in a Petersonian way to say that postmodernism is a sleight of hand
for Marxism.
And then David writes on Jean Baudrillard.
Jean Baudrillard referred to by some as the high priest of postmodernism is one such figure
that greatly disturbs Peterson's conflation of Marxist and postmodern theories.
In the mirror of production, Baudrillard vehemently challenges Marxism asking, are we
quite simply within a mode of production at all?
And have we ever been in one?
Baudrillard extends this question by turning his critical gaze back on Marxism, suggesting
that Marxism is predicated on the fundamentally, this is an important point, on the
fundamentally Eurocentric tenants of Productivism, Scientism and Historicism, and that
it homogenizes early societies under the light of the present structure of the capitalist
economy.
Therefore, silencing specific socio-historical contexts, projecting onto them the spectral
light of political economy.
This book marked a fundamental turning point in Baudrillard's work as he grew wary of the
possibility that Marxism could actually provide the blueprints for an effective mode of societal
change.
I would say as much of an anti-capitalist that I've become, and especially in the past,
say, years, so I've truly seen a lot of loopholes and a lot of problems with modernity and
capitalism.
The reason I'm still not a Marxist, or I probably will never be one, is because of this coin
David makes, but when Baudrillard makes, that they're too materialistic.
For me, Marxism is too, it's too contemporary in that sense.
It's too ephemeral.
It doesn't look into the deeper realities of society and being human.
And again, it's too, it's too, let's say, you know, I mean, there's even a term called
scientific, it's called scientific socialism or scientific utopianism.
So a lot of, it's heavily influenced by this post-enlightenment kind of thought.
And it tends to ignore so much.
And I mean, it, I should say, it's this is both capitalism and Marxism tends to ignore
human psychology, culture, sociology.
Therefore, Baudrillard makes a brilliant perspicacious point here that shouldn't we be
a bit critical of these prescriptions we are making on society.
And we're saying that this will work.
And then David makes a comment on Foucault.
In the order of things, he systematically, when you mean he, this Michel Foucault, in
the order of things, he systematically avoids discussing Marxism in terms of economic
theory in favor of many other liberal approaches to economics indicative of the
work of Adam Smith and Francois Cannae.
Foucault does this because as he makes abundantly clear, he believes that Marxism
exists in 19th century thought, like a fish in water, that, that is, it is unable
to breathe anywhere else.
Foucault might, the point that I was trying to make before, in a much better way,
there's exactly what I was trying to say.
This sentiment resonates in harmony with the overarching themes of his work,
because he refuses to acknowledge that societal ills or power can be reduced to a
single structural locus.
What I read this point for a moment, I thought this was Peterson writing because
Peterson has made strikingly similar points to that which Foucault makes,
especially when he speaks of ideology, that the fragment can't replace the whole,
that ideology only sees, ideology only sees part of the picture.
So in that sense, Peterson would 100% agree with Foucault here.
Well, not 100% because, you know, nothing works in absolutes.
But the point I'm trying to make is that good heavens, Peterson certainly has made
very similar points.
And back to what David's saying, thus Foucault is highly skeptical of the
possibility of a meaningful societal revolution, because without a comprehensive
evaluation of the plethora of institutions that govern our daily lives,
we risk perpetuating the same oppressive schema.
And here David makes a really interesting point.
He says, the thinkers that Peterson cites as representatives of postmodern
movement, Michel Foucault and Jacques Dorida, were greatly indebted to the
Western philosophical and literary canons, with some commentators even
labeling them neo-contiants.
Peterson's reductions, the reduction of these thinkers to philosophical
aberrations detached from Western civilization, illuminates his obliviousness
to this, to set canon.
Great point by David here, a very important one in this article, because this
conversation Peterson had with Camille Parglayer, perfectly illustrates what
David's saying here, because you can clearly see both of them, Parglayer
and Peterson are being very dismissive of these French intellectuals, saying
that they didn't read the classics that they weren't well read in the Western
canon, they were uneducated, but good heavens, I mean, maybe this is just my
own ignorance and my lack of, let's say, proper academic training.
But when I read some of, you know, I've only mostly read Sartre and Foucault, I
don't get the impression at all that they're uneducated or that they haven't
read enough Western philosophy, because they seem deeply well read scholars.
And I don't think in any way one could say that their aberrations to
Western philosophy, in many ways, as David points out, they seem to be
continuing on, I'm not saying it's just them, but they seem to be continuing on
the Kantian project, you know, all the way from Kant to Heidegger to whatever is
going to come up now.
And I don't think the aberrations in that, in that case, and this conversation
Peterson had with Pogliac just demonstrate, I wouldn't say, like, I think the
point David makes, he eliminates his own obliviousness to said canon, that might
be a bit unfair, but it just demonstrates that deep visceral hatred Peterson
has for these French intellectuals by being sort of casually dismissive of
them.
And then we get to another very important point, and especially a point that I
really enjoyed, not point, a part of the essay that I really enjoyed, especially
given my recent, let's call it enamelment with Hannah Arendt's work.
It's the section Peterson, Aaron, and totalitarianism.
Peterson doesn't seem to mention Hannah Arendt much in his work.
Yes, he just speak a lot about totalitarianism for sure.
I mean, maps of meaning was pretty much all about Peterson trying to
understand, you know, not the Nazis and totalitarianism and tyranny and all of
that.
But rarely does he mention Hannah Arendt, which is quite surprising, as David
points out.
He says, what is particularly striking is that Peterson makes no significant use
of Hannah Arendt, the think of fascism and totalitarianism, totalitarianism
by excellence.
I agree.
He just mentioned her briefly, however, suggesting that her seminal text, a
text, the banality of evil, would have better been more appropriately titled
the evil of banality.
In fact, let me find that quote so that, you know, we don't want to give the
impression that David's quoting Peterson out of context here.
It's 369.
I could quickly find the quote because I was going through this few days ago.
Peterson writes, nonetheless, we are more than we see and are more trouble than
we imagine when undisciplined and unrealized.
The banality of evil, Hannah Arendt's famous phrase applied to the often
unprecessing Nazi personality, is more accurately the evil of banality.
Our petty weaknesses accumulate and multiply and become the great evils of state.
As our technological power expands, the danger we pose increases and the
consequences of our voluntary stupidity multiply.
It is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves, not others, right, and that
we learn explicitly what that means.
Yes, so again, this is Peterson from 1999, and he still very much talks and
writes in similar prose and similar themes.
So again, the point I'm trying to make is David had, hasn't misquoted him in
any way or quoted him out of context.
The absence of Aaron's work in Peterson's exploration of these themes is suspicious
and signals that his understanding of totalitarianism is missing integral
philosophical insight, perhaps true.
This is particularly true of the lineage he traces between nihilism and the
development of totalitarianism.
So another bit of an experiment I did was I went on incognito, I had to, and I
googled just plainly Jordan Peterson and Hannah Arendt, and I wanted to see if
there was anything that involved Peterson talking about Hannah Arendt, and I
couldn't find anything not in his writing, not in his lectures.
So if it is right here, in fact, the only thing I found was this Reddit
thread of another person asking on the Jordan Peterson subreddit, is anyone
here familiar with Hannah Arendt?
Because both Peterson and Hannah Arendt seem to be in the deepest possible
way trying to understand totalitarianism.
Maybe Peterson was from a psychological perspective and Hannah Arendt more from
a sociological and philosophical perspective.
But I would certainly imagine Peterson bringing it up in more of his lectures.
So that is the point to keep in mind.
And just a completely ancillary point here, I think what really turned me to
Hannah Arendt's work, again, was David for sure.
But in particular, it was this series, David did, Hannah Arendt's The
Origins of Totalitarianism.
In fact, I ordered the book and it's on its way.
I thought Amazon Prime was much faster, but they're taking like weeks to
give the book.
Doesn't matter.
But I want to, this is going to be the next book that I read.
It's on my list because this series, David did, it was amazing.
I learned so much and I had to, I had to read the book.
There was no question about it because David converted me into a
erinite, erinite.
Anyway, and this leads to an interesting point.
Interesting, two views here, isn't it?
There's the Hannah Arendt view of the strongman Nazi personality and then
there's a Peterson view of the, of our individual moral failings that, that
causes nihilism and that causes the state to become corrupt.
So how do we reconcile these two views?
I don't know.
I don't think David is that in the article, but he does point, he does point
out some, uh, contradictory points between Hannah Arendt's views where she
took a much more critical philosophical lens and viewed what happened in the 20th
century and then Pearson's views that he portrays more in detail in maps of meaning.
Here's what David writes.
This idea of, of, of indifference and apathy that Peterson says is what
causes totalitarianism versus, let's say, taking upon responsibility, being
the ubermensch or a savior sometimes, and, and, and understanding that we play
a role in the, in the birth or the embodiment of totalitarian, totalitarian
states or personality or individuals or tyrants.
So David writes, sorry, I was very, uh, in articulate and trying to make
that point, um, I'm still learning apologies, but David writes, as Hannah
Arendt argues in the origins of totalitarianism, that word is hard to
pronounce.
It's kind of a mouthful.
Indifference to public affairs and new gravity on political issues,
are in themselves no sufficient cause for the rise of totalitarian movements.
According to Aaron, it is the strong man rather than the indifferent
public that has historically led to the rise of totalitarian regimes.
Ashley explains competitive and hostile attitudes are very useful for those
forms of dictatorship in which a strong man takes upon himself the troublesome
responsibility for the conduct of public affairs and hardly conforms to
traditional or typical definitions of nihilism.
This is the point.
This is the point.
This is an important point because clearly, you know, Peterson talks a lot
about taking upon, uh, carrying your own yoke to put it in Christian
parlance or taking upon the world's burdens onto oneself and then sort of
being a savior that in, in, in contrast to, let's say, apathy or indifference.
Now Aaron says, actually, no, indifference and apathy isn't the reason that totalitarianism
permeates in the rise.
It's rather, it's this kind of strong man, Nietzschean, ubermunch kind of personality.
Um, I don't know what to make of it.
Uh, firstly, I haven't read, uh, this book, even though I listened to David's
lecture, so I want to first read the book, maybe then I'll have a better idea.
Um, but it certainly is something to think about because I certainly, I most,
most definitely can't see how, yeah, that idea of, I think Nietzsche calls it, uh,
injecting meaning into one's veins, uh, where the idea of being this.
Hyper disciplined, sort of aesthetic individual who takes upon responsibility
and, and, and, and has orders, hyper conscientious, how that can very easily
become a peculiar kind of hubristic, almost narcissistic, uh, way to become a
strong man and then an eventual tyrant or totalitarian, at least psychologically.
I can see how that can manifest in someone in like, in like a, sort of like
a psychic state and I would even say, maybe I've even seen that in some people.
Maybe even myself, who knows?
But Hannah, Hannah Allen's point, it should be taken to heart.
It's, it's, it's a good point.
And David just laid out well here.
And then he gets to an interesting point here on essentialism.
So this idea that there are essential, essential, there's an essential
nature to being human, which to some extent I still believe I'm not a complete,
in that sense, anti essentialists.
Uh, but David writes Aaron's description of the strong man has founded
upon the belief in a kind of human nature, which would be subject to the same
laws of growth as that of the individual shares a strong affinity with Peterson's
persistent reliance on essentialist positions as illustrated in statements
about essential female and masculine pathologies.
Aaron elaborates on these essentialist beliefs as irrelevant, since Western
philosophy and religion has been defining and redefining it for more than 3,000 years.
Now, while it's true, this idea of redefining and defining, I would say, and again,
this is completely an intuition.
I have no firstly verbal majority, but also real, let's say sociological
and anthropological evidence to back up this claim.
But I do feel intuitively when I look at many cultures and when I even just
read about cultures and even experienced some cultures, there always seems to be
this kind of masculine and feminine.
And again, it's not a male-female thing because a man could be feminine
and masculine both and the other way around.
So it's not really a biological distinction, even though the biological
distinction exists, what I'm trying to say is this idea of the, I've kind of
an essential feminine and masculine spirit, let's say, it does seem, I don't
know if it's fair to say that that doesn't exist at all, because one could
see it in so many different cultures all across the world.
And if something is that common, isn't that maybe pointing towards some kind
of deeper truth?
Who knows?
But again, the point, David, the more deeper point David's trying to make
here is that that that attitude of essentialism could lead to this totalitarian
kind of mindset where you say, this is the way things should be done, this
absolutist, almost despotic attitude that this is the way this should be done.
So that certainly begs the question.
And David doesn't really point this out in the article, but this is exactly what
I was thinking while I was reading it, is how do we properly take
Peterson's, this adopt responsibility or personal responsibility mantra too hard,
which I think is a good message.
But how do we prevent it from being pathologized as a drive to be a totalitarian?
Because, and this is something I realized recently, and large men thinking, we
like to think that it was all about freedom and liberty and equality, but no,
it certainly had an absolutist attitude towards it, you know, Hobbes, for example.
So there were many enlightenment thinkers who were absolutist.
And more importantly, the deeper point is the idea of there being, let's say
categories and that is essentialist attitude of enlightenment thinking that
can be certainly connected or even imbue.
Tyrannical totalitarian sort of thinking.
So it's, it's, how do we delineate that?
And it's, it's, it's very, it's very nuanced there.
And I really didn't think of this until.
Maybe one or two years ago.
So something to, something to ponder and reflect on.
And now we get to the most, in my opinion, the part I like the most and the most
interesting part of the article, especially because I'm a Nietzschean and, and
the more I read Nietzsche, the more I thought, oh, Peterson's, there's something,
if people don't read Nietzsche and listen to Peterson lecture on Nietzsche,
they'd get a completely different picture on who Nietzsche is.
But in any case, I am a Nietzschean and I really like this part.
And I thought David made some good points.
So the question is, is Peterson misappropriating Nietzsche?
What I mean by this is I'm not saying Peterson is misquoting or quoting
man of context or trying to, uh, yeah, intentionally misappropriate him with
some kind of, uh, underlying motive, unethical underlying motive, not, not at all.
But sometimes biggest, like all of us, Peterson's got his own ideology.
I'm wondering if what he's really doing is just taking something Nietzsche said
and just fitting it into his philosophy, his ideology, and then, you know, sharing
it with the public, whereas this isn't what Nietzsche would say.
So as in this synthesis, let's say, of taking what Nietzsche said and, and,
and synthesizing it along with what Peterson's saying and whatever that result is,
Nietzsche would completely disagree with what that result is.
He would be totally opposed to Nietzsche's overall philosophy, even though
Nietzsche hasn't really got one set philosophy.
And I think he did that intentionally.
So there is, there, one has to be careful.
One has to be careful when, when they try to understand Nietzsche through a
Petersonian lens, let's say.
David writes, in the birth of tragedy, Nietzsche argues that the notion of truth
that runs through the course of history, history, the course of history are founded
not on their object, objectivity, but in their continual self proclamation of
objectivity.
For Nietzsche, the shift from language to science placed a scientific method at,
at the forefront of Western civilization, making everything quantifiable under the
scientific gaze.
As he explains, it is language which works on building the edifice of concepts.
Later, it is science.
Nietzsche expands on this idea, writing, what I understand by the spirit of science
is the belief which first came to light in the person of Socrates, that the depths
of nature can be fathomed and that knowledge can heal all ills.
According to Nietzsche, this belief in the ultimate infallibility of science or
Socrates' tendency to murder art is destructive, especially when left unacknowledged.
Now, Peterson here will certainly agree with this point because I've
listened to a couple of interviews where Peterson comments on Stephen Pinker's
Enlightenment Now and he is, he pretty much, pretty much says that he is quite
disappointed that in Enlightenment Now, Stephen Pinker has, has all these chapters
dedicated to the scientific method, Enlightenment, freedom, democracy, all that.
And a little chapter towards the latter part of the book.
I haven't read the book, so I'm not really sure, even though I think I've got a copy
where he dedicates to the arts and the humanities.
And he says that's unfortunate because really it should be the other way around
because most of life or most of what we are is, let's say, we should be indebted
to the arts and the humanities.
And science is very, very much a new phenomenon.
It's a new thing in our society.
Therefore, it is, it is a good point.
To Nietzsche, science is truly capable of confining the individual within the
smallest circle of solvable tasks.
As he explains, science spurred on by its powerful delusion is hurrying,
hurrying unstoppable towards limits where the optimism hidden in the essence of
logic will founder and break up.
So then we get to Nietzsche versus 12 Rules for Life.
And this is kind of the point I made when I started commenting on the section
where if Nietzsche read 12 Rules for Life, he'd probably disagree with most of it.
And David explains why.
12 Rules for Life proclaiming the necessity for people, young men.
I want to say, you know, David's put this in here kind of as like a sly comment,
you know, kind of being dismissive that all Peterson only caters to this
certain demographic.
It seems like a straw man and a ad hominem attack, because firstly,
an ad hominem as if helping young men makes him a particularly evil person.
I mean, I don't see what's wrong with helping young men.
You know, if people need help, people should get help.
I'm a young man.
And when I was 20, 21, reading Jordan Peterson's book helped me a lot.
It gave me structure and meaning and purpose.
And those things matter.
Life, life is difficult.
And I'm truly grateful for that.
And other than that, Peterson, I know a lot of, in fact, a lot of the people
that I know who are Jordan Peterson fans, let's say, are women.
Funny enough, one of my good friends, she and I, we'll be going to the,
Jordan Peterson comes to Melbourne, visiting Melbourne, end of the yacht,
and we bought tickets for his kind of talk.
And I'll be going with him.
And she really, she loves Jordan Peterson.
So I don't know if it's fair that, you know, it's, it's sort of like a straw
man and ad hominem.
And also, frankly, such slight comments seem unproductive.
I mean, it's such a good article.
And it's just saying young men as if it's a bad thing.
It, it cheapens and reduces this well written article to that of a headpiece
by some corporate media journalists.
And that's unfortunate.
But anyway, it's just a little bit of criticism that I had, little bit of criticism
that I have.
Um, so I'll get back to it.
Twirlers for life proclaiming the necessity for people to adopt an
aesthetic lifestyle in the form of a mutated Christian conservatism conservatism
stands diametrically opposed to Nietzsche's central claim in the
genealogy of morality, that the aesthetic ideal is not something to strive for,
but rather it is the consequence of a life attempting to inject artificial
meaning into its veins in a poor attempt at, at inoculation from degeneration.
In this capacity, Peterson resembles the ascetic priest that Nietzsche cast
castigates.
The task of intellectual should, should not be to inject arbitrary rules and
regulations into people, but rather to foster perspectival scene that
welcomes more eyes, various eyes we are able to use to sketch a more
complete understanding of our objectivity, superlative point.
In my opinion, this little para here, or this little part sentence, let's say,
it's the best sentence in the whole article, really good point, because it's
something I began to realize, maybe again, two or three years ago, because I saw
that in modern, in our new age entrenched culture, it seems like every
public intellectual is becoming a self-help guru.
And that's kind of unfortunate because there's nothing wrong with self-help,
but we should understand that everything has its place.
Self-help should be separated from intellectualism and public, or public
intellectuals, because it seems like, you know, a lot of, even Sam Harris, you
know, he's got meditation and mindfulness, or a lot of public
intellectuals have just become self-help gurus, kind of the celebrity self-help
gurus.
And that's unfortunate because the, what intellectual, in my opinion, should
do is not reaffirm what you already believe.
But yes, as David beautifully puts it, and it clearly points out, really make
us feel uncomfortable in our beliefs, make us, make us completely change our
perspectives and view the world in different lenses and give us kind of
perspective of seeing Adorno had a great quote, I think, in a aesthetic theory.
I'm completely paraphrasing here, but he says, and he, he's talking about art here.
He says, Adorno, that the real purpose of art should be to sort of, I can't
really remember the quote, but the idea is the purpose of art should be to make
us feel uncomfortable, to challenge our dogmas, our pre-health beliefs, and really
you know, lift, change our life radically and fundamentally in how we view the world.
And in my opinion, that's also what a public intellectual should do, not
become a self-help guru.
And if they want to become self-help guru, there's nothing wrong with that.
Like that's, that's okay.
But then there's something else.
They're not a public intellectual or an intellectual, for that matter.
So this is probably the best point David makes in the whole article.
Peterson's project is an, is an attempt then to move away from the Nietzsche
notion of perspectival seeing toward the domain of a historical, a contextual
scene. This narrowing of possibility operates to maintain the authority of
those who choose what is considered worth seeing.
And through that, through, and through what needs, pushing society towards
sovereign and dictatorial rule.
Again, this last bit here is quite apt to the whole COVID lockdown,
controversy debate that a lot of people got, got into in the intellectual
dark web. I'm using that as an umbrella term for like the
Peterson's and the, and Sam Harris's.
That's again, that idea of perspectival seeing is quite important here.
So then we get to the section where it's the science versus Peterson.
And then David comments on some of the Aristotelian notions of science.
He writes, though Peterson's line of argumentation seems to suggest a
science post-modernism opposition, a considerable number of scientific
journals have published articles addressing the growing stigmatization
and discrimination trans and gender queer people experience regularly.
It's a good point. A lot of us don't spend the time to go and read up on these
articles, but there certainly is a, a good amount of literature that
probably uses the scientific method to point this out.
So it is true. There is that stigmatization within trans people,
especially maybe because it's now it's become a lot more political.
And that's quite unfortunate. That is, that is deep.
I hate saying that's quite, that's quite unfortunate because it's like a
throwaway term for everything these days, but that's, that's a, that's a sad
truth and we should think about that.
We should think about that.
Such articles, though they conform to the same scientific rationale utilized by
Peterson shed light on the great deal of contradictions,
oppositions and divergent beliefs in this supposedly objective field of study.
This is an important point David makes.
These studies correspond to the domain of research that aligns with the
Aristotelian, I can't pronounce that, aligns with the Aristotelian maxim of
phronesis, which may be understood as fostering practical intellectual
activity aimed at clarifying the problems risks and possibilities we face as humans
and society, societies.
This approach, although still immersed in the scientific tradition stands opposed to the
other domain of Aristotelian reason of episteme that proclaims the a priori
nature of scientific knowledge.
So this again kind of touches on that.
How do we derive oats plainly from science?
Because it seems like the scientific institution itself is, let's say,
bifurcated into this phronesis and episteme.
And in many ways, phronesis does help us derive oats, but it is complicated because
that also involves contextual seeing, sociology, all of that.
This brand of research, while disavowed by Peterson,
presents a foray into the lives and experiences of marginalized groups that
would otherwise be silenced, absolutely.
And now another interesting point I would say from the whole article,
my favorite parts were Nietzsche and postmodernism and the Baudrillard
reality and truth.
Well worth a read, just due to those two parts.
The question that Baudrillard asks is, what is objective truth?
Job Baudrillard has vigorously challenged the position held by scholars such as Peterson
on objectivity and truth, suggesting instead that science like any discourse is organized
on the basis of a conventional logic, adding that it explains things which have been defined
and formalized in advance, which subsequently conform to these explanations.
And again, Peterson would agree with this point because I've listened to his conversations with
recently Richard Dawkins and then Sam Harris, where they get into the fact value distinction.
And again, one would assume that Peterson would find a certain validity in what Baudrillard's
pointing out here, because in that sense, Richard Feynman, I'm connecting many figures here,
Richard Feynman, probably my favorite scientist, I love listening to his lectures.
He is actually wrong to say the philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as
ornithology is to birds.
That's a wrong statement.
That's an invalid statement in my opinion, because no, no, no, the philosophy of science
is a part of the scientific process.
It's a part of the scientific institution.
In many ways, it maybe is what this Aristotelian frenesis is about.
We need to understand what science is and how we make our presuppositions.
Oh, sorry, on what presuppositions we start from, on what axioms.
That probably is the fundamental question of science these days.
How do we make our assumptions?
What's the starting point?
Again, I think apart from the conversations that I've heard Peterson have,
he probably understands that this problem inherently exists in our modern conception of
science.
It's probably why he's interested in Jung, in archetypes, in Christian neoplatonism,
symbolism, and in general, religious narrative, because he sees those to be a sort of,
he sees that can be coupled with science to find some kind of, let's say, objective
starting point for science to work off.
And I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly at least points to the problem,
or hints at the problem.
So David states, Baudrillard doesn't say that scientific conclusions are invalid.
He actually doesn't, I think.
I haven't read much Baudrillard, obviously, but I don't get that impression at least.
But what he says very clearly is that whatever these scientific conclusions are,
these conclusions should not be transposed onto any societal or cultural context.
So these studies, so there were some studies that he cited above in the article,
the studies speak to the late Baudrillard's conception of singularity.
Okay, I'm going to say this is a part that I kind of am struggling to grok yet.
I still can't fathom it.
It, I don't know, for me, it still seems incomprehensible, but I think it's because
I haven't done enough reading.
I haven't done enough studying to Baudrillard.
So David writes, Baudrillard's conception of singularity, which holds that every detail
of the world is perfect if it is not referred to some larger set.
Reality for Baudrillard is always caught in a play of signification and suggestions of a
naturality made by the authoritative scientific community mistake the only true nature of the
world as a world of appearances in which there may not be anything but a discourse of the real
and the rational.
Just a point here, the idea of, I think this in many ways is the scientific question, oh,
sorry, the philosophical question and the philosophical battle that we've been having
since time immemorial, ever since, you know, Socrates, Plato and all that is,
in our epistemology, how do we know what's true and how do we know what's appearing as true?
It seems to be the distinction between, let's say, the rationalist and the empiricists between
the Joan Locke and the David Hume or the continental philosophers and then the kind of
English analytical philosophers.
How do we know what's true and what appears as true?
So that's such an important point and Baudrillard is, in many ways,
Baudrillard's working off that here.
According to Baudrillard, then notions of an objective truth are fundamentally flawed
and any attempt to occupy an objective field of study is bound to fail and merely become
science signifiers of a real signified.
I hope we saw a bit of a wordplay there, that's difficult to understand.
The fundamental impossibility of performing objective studies and or revealing fundamental
truths is understood by Baudrillard and his theory of simulation.
For Baudrillard, simulation occurs when the world has become real beyond our wildest expectations.
And can be described as the outcome of calculated
mood to put the illusion of the world to death.
Scientific discourse that rely on notions of objectivity and truth
therefore dissolve into the imaginary of the sign or the sphere of truth
and leaves us with reality and therefore simulation in all its glory.
The real then is merely a particular case of that simulation that Baudrillard argues
allows our society to think itself and live itself as superior to all others.
Baudrillard's work can be read as not necessarily opposing the domain of scientific inquiry
but accounting for the degree to which any scientific inquiry
should be attuned to the cultural and significator conditions of the object of study.
I completely attribute this to my lack of understanding, my lack of knowledge.
The reason I'm saying that is not for some kind of false modesty or false humility,
it's because genuinely I haven't done enough study and reading.
This is in my field of study, I haven't gone through the proper formal academic process
of studying all its philosophers, I'm a autodidact, I'm doing it on my own.
But really sometimes when I read these kind of perils, I do wonder is this some kind of word
game that these thinkers are playing with their brilliant verbal and intellectual capabilities
with the ability to write and is it some kind of game? I don't even mean game in a cynical way,
I mean is it truly a way they're trying to make some pre-held belief they have and try to make
it look as if it's something that's true about the world and make it cohere using language.
Is it a language game to sound wittgensteinian? I don't know because when I read this even though
as I said before I don't fully comprehend it or fully understand it, I certainly can see that
it's its intimations of something true, something that's topically true about reality
and it points to so many different domains of our current way of doing the world.
And for me that coheres even though what they're trying to say really doesn't cohere if that makes
sense. Like what I'm trying to say is sort of let's say normatively some of what they're saying
is like oh yeah that I can see how how they come to these conclusions. Okay I don't know just
thinking out loud here as I tend to do in this podcast and on the topic of not understanding
things I would say again not David's fault, my own fault, my own ignorance, I truly thought it
hard to understand this section, Baudrillard Butler and those voices of the marginalized. So
that's about the whole essay, that's about 304 Paras and here's the thing, I think part
of it was because simply it's that section of the essay about the gender controversy that
I didn't really care that much to be frank and I think I just truly couldn't I couldn't
penetrate it, that's what it was. The reason I found it a bit incomprehensible was because
I could see that David's making some important points here but I couldn't I don't know I didn't
know why but like for example the the previous points even though there were parts of it that
I didn't really get I at least I at least got the essence of his argument I was getting at
where he was going to it but this section for me I just couldn't I couldn't penetrate it and it
it didn't click with me to put it plainly and apart from that this is just a complete personal
thing I've recently been trying to study Heidegger, been trying to get through being in time.
Mate I am eternally perplexed about everything I haven't really if you can probably see from
this podcast I haven't got anything substantial or coherent to say but especially phenomenology
but virtually anything because Heidegger has completely overturned my views on so many things
so yeah I'm in this place of this deep I'm I'm self I'm being extremely self-critical of
of what I believe and I'm also very uncertain about virtually all my beliefs and that on that
rather legubrious note let's go to the conclusion but before I do read the conclusion I want to
say something firstly I want to say I think Peterson totally deeply understands everything
that David points out here even though he isn't very explicit about it he does get his he sees this
inherent income and stability between between what we have as modern science and how can we derive
values from it he sees the incomes income and stability between what modernity tells us
and the deeper truth that postmodernist found this idea of context he's even said it in a couple
of his podcasts that he does agree with this notion of the complexity of interpretations and how much
how deep that that really goes into reality in some sense not just at let's say at the level of
text or hermeneutics but that this this the problem of interpretation is a big problem
and he points to AI researchers he points to many many places within the field of science to
to hit at that so I think he gets it and I would say it's because of that maybe that I say that I
apart from him as a person but just as an intellectual I began to admire him a lot more
because he's willing to publicly flesh out these ideas and make mistakes publicly especially someone
like him who's got such public acclaim and and you know because he gets himself in all his political
controversies the moment he makes a mistake he is hammered and he is is there always caving
critiques written about him which can be quite difficult being a public figure one shouldn't
just think that that's uh it's quite hard to go through that it's it's a lot of stress
so I do admire that kind of courage that he has to publicly deal with these issues and
I I've got to say I am a bit disheartened that I I feel like with time with his influence he's
becoming more and more ideological and even a bit more dogmatic in his beliefs and his views
which for me is unfortunate because then this project he has to work this out to
try and reconcile these if it's reconcilable these uh
income and surabilities I feel like that that then he won't have a genuine journey or in doing that
because if he becomes more and more let's say dogmatic in his views I really hope he that he
doesn't go there but again all the points David makes in this article I think is very apt to
who Jordan Peterson is and I think he gets it
secondly I want to say David uh if you have if you do watch this episode I really hope you do
I want to try and treat this at you a couple of times to to try and get your attention
but if you do watch this episode and if you come this far mate I know I'm very very long winded
it's a problem of mine I never get to the point but if you come this far I would like to
sincerely uh invite you on the podcast for an interview because I would love to talk to you
and learn from you I have so many questions I gotta say David again not blowing steam up your
ass put it in a well go way um you you truly have been that kind intellectual that you talk about
this uh part here about perspectival scene you probably are seeing right now me learning from
you and trying to trying to see the world and see all these topics through different
perspectives and different views because you foster that kind of perspective of seeing in me
so and I'm a product of in that sense of your youtube channel a living example let's say to
put it in a dramatic way and again your work on Hannah Irwin has made me fall in love with her
in some sense maybe in fact maybe I should have you all on the podcast if you do agree that
is of course after um I'm done reading the origins of totalitarianism because then I'll have something
bit more substantial to discuss with you but again this is my invite to the podcast and on that note
I would read the conclusion to the article and end this episode beyond locating the various
contradictions and fallacious remarks Peterson makes this paper has also argued that Peterson's
assault against bill c16 risks mirroring the same systemic instantiations of totalitarianism that he
claims to know so much about to reiterate this is not to suggest that he represents uh these
movements directly but that there are many affinities between these oppressive ideological
systems and Peterson's faith in a universal conception of truth that's to a point and this
paper serves the purpose of mounting a philosophically analytical rebuttal to Peterson's central
claims by pointing an eminent critique pointing to the many shortcomings of his speculations
and locating epistemic fallacies that may be observed in his ideas this is a necessary form
of critique because unlike the Hegelian model of oppositional politics that poses a critique from an
antithetical and exterior positionality this form identifies the core of the theoretical
inadequacy of Peterson's project from the inside and I think David you've accomplished that
