Hey everyone, today we're going to discuss the idea of Bodham using the existential theories of the philosopher Sauron Kerkrgaard and particularly on what he's delineated in his book, either or, which some would argue is his magnum opus.
Also, sorry about the background noise, someone's mowing their lawn, just when, as per usual, just as per usual, just when I've decided to record a video.
But firstly, let me read something from the book.
So here, Kerkrgaard is writing as the esteem, and I'll get into what that means in a bit.
He says this,
By pressing the speed to the maximum, one need only say to oneself, Bodham is a root of all evil.
Strange that Bodham, so still and static, should have such power to set things in motion.
The effect that Bodham exercises is altogether magical, except that it is not one of attraction, but of repulsion.
So firstly, starting off this section of either or, you could see clearly, Kerkrgaard's esteem is no fan of Bodham.
He literally states that we're repelled by it.
But it's important to understand this, before we get to exploring this idea of Bodham, via the lens of Kerkrgaard, is that this is particularly not what Kerkrgaard believes.
And that's really important, because this, in my opinion, is what makes Kerkrgaard a brilliant philosopher.
You never really truly know what his beliefs are.
He delineates and outlines different kinds of existential theories.
And the esteem, the person who wants to live the aesthetic life, I think is in a rather uncanny way pertinent to our times.
I wouldn't say uncanny as a proper word, but in a rather interesting way,
pertinent to our times, because I'd postulate that in many ways, aren't we all esthetes?
As in, Kerkrgaard's esteem is a person who constantly pursues happiness and novelty that they constantly want to be titillated.
Isn't that modern society?
If you think of society, and to use the term that I heard from, in fact, Mama Ewan,
society itself has this meta-aim, contemporary society, and that meta-aim tends to be happiness.
So if you go to a person and ask, why do you work?
You could say, I'm working for money.
And then you ask, why do you want to make money?
Or I'm making, I want to make money to be financially free, or I want to, you know, facadeist.
Most people, unfortunately, would say, I'm making money just to survive.
And that's the harsh, crude reality of the world we live in.
People simply want to get by.
But at the same time, let's say people that are a bit more well-off, a bit more middle-class, a bit more bourgeois.
If you keep questioning what the purpose of what they're doing is, at one point,
the word happiness comes up.
I'm making money to be more happy.
I'm making more money to, like, and travel the world, experience new things, have novelty.
And for Kerkrgaard, this is the esteem.
Now, he doesn't place any moral judgment on being an esteem.
It's simply, again, as I kind of touched on before, is a mode of life,
an existential mode of life, a state of being.
And the esteem constantly pursues the new thing, be it sex, be it women,
be it flirting, be it money, be it alcohol, drugs, or on the other side,
what some would call high culture, intellectual work.
What I'm doing right now is, in some ways, an aesthetic act, or beauty and art, or classical music,
or indulge oneself in being titillated by such things.
Nevertheless, it's still taking real pleasure in the aesthetic life.
And that's what the esteem is.
And I think, for our times, again, to not to repeat myself, the esteem's mode of living is germane.
But here's the way I bring in Zhek.
It's not just that we are estates, because we spontaneously, deep in our core,
and in some authentic sense, want to be an estate, that this is the kind of aesthetic life.
Rather, in many ways, the moral imperative, the injunction by society,
is to enjoy, to live your best life.
And two ways of thinking about it is the typical kind of crude 1960s madmen style where,
oh, it's about sex, drugs, money, women, it's just being the typical consumer,
making more money so it can consume more.
That's the very crude way that we kind of think of how consumerism, for instance, works.
Buy this thing, buy this product, and that'll fulfill your desires, that'll make you happy,
and keep going to the next one, to the next one, kind of like the Jay-Z song.
But of course, the other side of the same coin is a bit more subtle, but the kind of new age
aesthetic life, you know, self-actualization, live your best life, people who obsess over self-help
and productivity and mindfulness.
And you know, I hate this stuff because it's really overused.
Well-being, well-being, you know, you hear Sam Harris types constantly talk about it.
It's important to meditate, people obsess over listening to Andrew Huberman's,
optimizing your health.
And then, of course, there's more of the positive psychology, which is like pop positive psychology,
focus on being your best self.
And then the kind of the new age, spiritualist type is
divine feminine, divine masculine.
I'm one with the universe, which unfortunately, and I'm not to get too carried away,
has a strain of fascism to it too.
But all these things, all these things, the kind of crude consumerism and even the new age
self-actualization, I put it all on the umbrella of Kierkegaard's aesthetic life.
And if you read, so the book, either or, it's a dialectical book.
If you read the either, which is on the esteem, you'll see so much of what Kierkegaard's writing
about in the 1840s, remarkably, applies to our times, specifically our time or especially our
times, given the kind of the stage of capitalism we are in right now.
And I'm not pointing or like blaming everything on capitalism in a way I kind of am,
but a lot of our culture, the way we live, it's influenced by the ideological impositions of
neoliberal capitalism.
I'll leave it there, but it's a bit more complicated.
But I'll put it like this.
And I think that's the point that Jack makes.
He states that the super ego imperative is to enjoy.
The traditional notion of psychoanalysis is that because of some inner obstacles,
you internalized, identified excessively, excessively with paternal or other social prohibitions,
you cannot set yourself free to enjoy, to pleasure is not accessible for you.
It is accessible to you only in pathological forms of feeling guilty and so on.
So then the idea is psychoanalysis allows you to suspend, overcome these internalized prohibitions
so that it enables you to enjoy.
The problem today is that the commandment of the ruling ideologies enjoy in different ways.
It can be sexual enjoyment, consumption, commodity enjoyment, up to spiritual enjoyment,
realize yourself, whatever.
And I think that the problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to
be able to spontaneously enjoy.
The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.
So it's because of this super ego imperative that we have to enjoy.
In many ways, we are forced to be esthetes in the modern world.
That we need to understand what Kedrican means about the aesthetic life or particularly for
this video, the idea of boredom and exploit via the aesthetic lens.
Because again, I am beating our dead horse here.
We, in many ways, are all esthetes.
In the book, in this part of the book, he continues saying he says, okay,
the quintessential example is to think of children.
We all think of children and what happens when children are bored.
They generally get up to no good.
You know, we hear terms of, you know, teenage illinquency or we see all these statistics,
sociological statistics about when kids have nothing to do, they get up to no good.
And he says, this is a clear indicator that being boredom is repulsive.
It's not a good thing.
It's in fact the root of all evil as the esthetes writes as Kedrican.
I'm going to keep saying as Kedrican writes because it's kind of confusing to mix them together.
It's kind of something fun about reading Kedrican because you never really know
which who he's writing as because he's got so many pseudonyms and different ways of
explaining existence.
And then he goes on by saying that, oh, look, the fact that children behave in such way
when they're bored is the reason that boredom is a problem.
And then he states, what wounded them that the world is regressing, that evil is gaining ground
more and more since boredom is on the increase and boredom is a root of all evil.
And then with the stroke of genius, I would say Kedrican predicts this pathological obsession
we all have with being productive or with wanting to always be busy,
which one would say is the ideology of productivism.
So I kind of touched on this a bit before.
I was talking about people like Andrew Huberman or all these, you know,
that the myriad self-help productivity gurus on YouTube.
And again, they have a place, a certain place.
But what happens is that what people apply to their lives to be more productive or to try and
kind of be a bit more efficient, the part replaces the whole.
That's all they become.
They all become people who need to optimize everything.
And it comes to a point where everything including things like love and family and intimacy,
all these things are viewed through the lens of productivity,
ticking off boxes and making the most out of the time you have for a day.
And for Kedrican, that is, he kind of in a very sadonic way, he mocks it.
And he says that that is not the way we humans are.
We humans, you know, are not machines and we don't have to constantly live this hyper-productive,
optimized life.
So he's very sadonic about it.
And he says something like this.
There are people with an extraordinary gift for transforming everything into a business whose
whole life is business, who fall in love and marry, listen to a joke and admire a work of art
with the same zealous sense of affairs which they work in the office.
Isn't that so interesting because I've recently been seeing on Twitter
of people posting these long Google Docs, Google Docs or long Google Docs documents,
there we go, long Google Docs with sort of like checklists on reasons to date me.
So even love has become like a kind of a business interaction or a business transaction.
And then of course, dating apps, dating apps is perhaps in our times the quintessential example
of how we commodify other people and we kind of, you know, check the boxes and see
our interactions become, yeah, okay, at a very kind of a transactional level.
The same way we go to the supermarket and buy, let's say, I don't know, a can of tuna and you
got all these myriad options, we treat other human beings the same way.
But of course, that's not how love works. Love doesn't work where you pick the best
from the rest. It's rather it's in retrospect, you pick someone and then you make them the best
from your own choice, whole other conversation. But the point being, okay, KKGOT sees how once
we start living in a certain way where we repel boredom, we repel not making the best use of our
time and we think that's kind of like a sin because again, our moral injunction or the
supigo commandment is to live your best life. Then everything has to be optimized. We all
have to be pathologically obsessed with being productive and then he continues and he is where
he's being a bit sadonic, which I love. So all people are boring. The word itself indicates
the possibility of a subdivision. Boring can describe a person who boasts others as well as
one who boasts himself. Those who both others are the general plebians, the mass, the endless
strain of humanity in general. Those who both themselves are the elect, the nobility and how
strange it is that, and I love this line, how strange it is that those who don't both themselves
usually both others while those who both themselves amuse others. The people who do not
both themselves are generally those who are busy in the world in one way or another. But that is
just why they are the most boring, the most insufferable of all. And I thought that was really
interesting because if you think about it, it's kind of like the argument, in fact I've got the
book right here. Makusa makes in his book One Dimensional Man that when people become these
kind of hyper-optimized, you know, productivity robots, they in fact do become very one dimensional.
All their life entails is a life of optimizing one's finances, optimizing one's time,
living this very to-do-less space life. And I am guilty as charged. I happen to be one of them.
In fact, I would say it's really interesting because I was with a girl for a while. I was
dating a girl for a few months and you know, probably one reason we broke up was she was
the opposite of me. She was very good at relaxing and not doing anything. So I think it certainly
is a bit of a personality trait too. Although I don't want to get into psychology and
psychology as Kierkegaard's philosophy here, I think it's more for cultural phenomena where,
yes, we all have this desire, this yearning to constantly be productive. And I think the
point Kierkegaard makes here is that when all our life is treated like a business, as he's
stated here, then we kind of lose this spirit of what it means to be human. We lose this kind of
what's, I don't even know. In a way, we stop being human. We become an automaton.
And it's even an interesting Marxist critique of modern society. So, and yeah, people like
that generally seem to be quite boring. I find people who are hyper-obsessed with self-help,
the most boring, artificial people in the world, because it seems that everything in their life
is architected, it's contrived, and I find that to be, yeah, as, you know, he writes,
rather boring and insufferable. But seeing all that, in the middle of this section,
Kierkegaard takes a bit of a turn and he states this, and afterwards I'll expand on what he means
here, which at least my reading of what he's trying to state here. He states,
idleness, it is usually said, is a root of all evil. To prevent this evil, one recommends work.
However, it is easy to see from the remedy as well as the feared cause, that is, that this whole
view is of very plebeian extraction. Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil. Quite the
contrary, it is a truly divine way of life, so long as one is not born. Certainly, idleness
may lead you to lose your fortune and so on, but of such things, the man of noble nature has no fear.
What he fears is boredom. The Olympian gods were not bored. They pondered in happy idleness,
oh sorry, they prospered in happy idleness. A beauty who neither soothes nor spends,
nor irons nor reads, nor makes music as happy in her idleness, for she is not bored. So far from
idleness being the root of all evil, rather it is the true good. The root of all evil is boredom,
and that is what must be kept at bay. Idleness is not evil. Indeed, one can say that any human
who lacks appreciation of it proves that he has not raised himself to the level of humanity.
So at last line, I kind of was kind of what I was trying to articulate, that in many ways,
becoming this kind of one-dimensional person, you lose a part of what it means to be human,
or you don't raise yourself to the level of humanity one could add.
Okay, so in the paragraph I read, what's Krikgat saying? My reading is that, of course,
as even Bertrand Russell, who probably comes from a very different tradition, more of the
analytical tradition, states, idleness is not a bad thing. Idleness, in fact, is a good thing to
be human. We humans need a bit of idle time, as perhaps Nietzsche said, old great ideas come
to us when we are walking in walks. So we need time that is just time spent without any, it's
purposeless time. It's time not, it's not resting so you could recuperate and do more work. It's
rather the subtle art of nothingness, of idleness. And in fact, in modern society, as I've touched on,
we simply don't have to be idle. We simply don't have time to be idle anymore,
although we are essentially both. Now, I'll explain what I mean by essentially both a bit later,
because as we read this section, what you see is Krikgat delineates that
boredom is an ontological category. It's intrinsic to being human. We can't
get rid of it. We can't jettison it from our existence. And that's the problem. The problem
is that since boredom, despite as he states, or the esteed states, is the root of all evil,
despite that, it still is a part of who we are. We, in a very fundamental sense, are bored. But,
but while we are bored, we don't have time to be idle, which Krikgat views, or the esteed views,
as an, as a virtue that idleness is a good thing. And one would agree, sometimes the most,
the most sublime ideas, the most sublime things happen when we are being idle. It could even be
a random interaction with a stranger that happens when we are really not getting up to anything,
and not really rushing to the next thing or the next task. But of course, the problem is,
because of our current societal ideology of, of, you know, be productive, be busy,
do make the best use of your time. And then the other much more, I would say, dark side of things,
where people simply don't have time to relax anymore, as they simply have to put food on the
table. Just to get by, people are always working, taking multiple jobs. Idleness is, is going away.
It's, it's, it's left our existence while we are also fundamentally bored. That, that's sort of
differences, but they're not the same thing. Idleness is something, it's something at a,
at a very practical level that we need to incorporate into our lives. Whereas boredom,
it is existential. It's, it's constitutive of what it means to be human. In fact, in the book,
it's stated quite interestingly, we can trace this. So when he means this, he means boredom.
From the very beginning of the world, the gods were bored. So they created man. Adam was bored
because he was alone. So Eve was created. From that time, boredom entered the world and grew
in exact proportion to the growth of population. Adam was bored alone. Then Adam and Eve were bored
in union. Then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored on famil. Then the population increased
and the peoples were bored on mass. So my reading of that little bit is that the estate is saying,
despite him despising boredom, despite him finding it repulsive, we can't get rid of it. It's kind
of like, at least for the estate, it's kind of like a predicament. And it's not something
we can just choose not to have in our lives. It's a part of being human. And
then he states, this is the problem. When we don't have time to be idle, which is kind of
like a practical thing we incorporate into our lives, but we are still bored, it leads to
meaninglessness. And I think that's where it becomes like a social phenomena where people have a lot
of, there's like a mental health crisis, there's a term, a neologism coined by social psychologists
that's by despair. It's simply people dying from unhappiness, not simply it's
tragically people dying from unhappiness. And for Cricketgarten, one reason for this would be
because we haven't acknowledged the fact that in the core of who we are is in some sense this void
of boredom and it's there. And he puts it beautifully, he says, boredom rests upon the nothingness
that winds its way through existence. It's bitterness, like that which comes from gazing down
into an infinite abyss, is infinite. So you can see from that little line there how, you know,
thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre were influenced by Cricketgarten quite interestingly. So we need
to be able to acknowledge this boredom being a part of our ontological condition. And then,
and then what? And the question is then what? Given the fact that, yes, boredom for the acid is
evil, and what do we do from there? Cricketgarten, for better or worse, and for my belief is that for
better, he is not a self-op author. So he doesn't really write prescriptive texts except perhaps
as more of his religious writing. The fact of the matter is there really isn't no remedy or panacea
to the fact that boredom to the core is a part of who we are. Although one thing that helps in
understanding that is that then we acknowledge it. And then we also understand that idleness per se
isn't a bad thing. And in fact, we should probably make time and not listen to the societal imperatives
or societal injunctions to constantly do something and allow ourselves to be idle.
But that doesn't mean any of that is prescriptive. And that's not the purpose of this video either.
I don't give advice on this channel. But to kind of end it on a, let's say a positive note,
what is the solution to this dilemma, this predicament we are in? The fact that we are
ontologically bored, it's innate to who we are, and that we don't have time to be idle. Therefore,
we have this emptiness and void in the middle of our lives. And what is the solution to
compulsive pathological business? Now, of course, look, I could give the typical self-advice or
kind of discuss, you know, or take time, have me time in your calendar, lock out me time,
I don't know, meditate, go for walks, you know, partake in self-care things. Those are great.
Do all of that. I do most of those things. I exercise. I run. I don't meditate. I hate
meditating. But I do engage in these things because they're great. It's important to take
of your help. But, but for me, still those are rather superficial things. What I've found personally
is that the kind of the remedy to, I wouldn't even call it a remedy, not the perfect remedy, but
what helps me cope with this existential dread, let's say, or this nappingness, this void of
boredom, is to deeply fall in love with the world, to deeply, not to do the whole Western
Buddhist thing where you detach yourself from the world and be like, oh, everything's a cosmic
phenomenon. No, no, no. Attach yourself more to the world, care more about the world, and find
something you deeply care about. For me, it happens to be writing, philosophy, politics.
These are things that I, I would, I would go to the ends of my existence to, to, to deeply
to go all the way in some sense. And I think that's the only antidote to,
to this boredom we have in existence. It's not, it's not playing this middle game where you
do a bit of everything, but rather finding something that's like an infinite passion that
takes you to all the way to the end, to the point where, in fact, when you truly, truly care about
a certain vocation, let's say, be it a scientist, a political activist, an engineer, an artist,
a philosopher, you would sacrifice your own well-being for that course, for the vocation.
If you're building something, if you're writing a book, if you're partaking in some kind of political
movement, especially I would say, if you're partaking in some kind of political movement,
you would sacrifice your well-being, your, your, your happiness, which the estate, you know,
would find that repulsive. You would sacrifice all of that for the course. And I think that
is the only way to exist in this world. It's not, it's not through taking this kind of middle
grader kind of, trying to optimize everything in your life. I think that's a lie sold to us,
so that we can in fact be, be, be suckers and, and buy more things off the market.
And of course, that, for many people, this comes in the form of family. That is certainly
something you can commit yourself to. But the point being, the, the, the, I don't think,
I think the worst thing one could do with boredom is to ignore it, repress it, don't look into it,
and just, you know, take on many things in life and just drown yourself with tasks or
businesses to use a word credit card. I don't mean business in like the economic
transactional sense, but rather in, in always doing things and not obviously be idle.
My view one should confront that boredom is a part of who we are. It's, it's
considerative to our existence. And then, then kind of go all the way, go all the way, find
something that will, that feel, that feel not just wake you up in the morning, but even keep you
up late at night to the point where it's in fact bad for you. And I think that's where passion
lies. Passion, for me, much like boredom, passion itself is a, it's a, it's a, it's what it means
to be human. You will, you will achieve the level of humanity when you truly are passionate about
something. And at least that's what I believe. But again, I'm, I'm not being prescriptive here.
I found that for me, that's the only way to live. It's life of passion.
Thanks for watching. Hope you found that useful. Cheers.
