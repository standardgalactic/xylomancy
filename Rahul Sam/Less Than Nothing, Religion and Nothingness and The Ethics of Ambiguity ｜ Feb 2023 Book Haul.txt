Hey everyone, welcome to my February 2023 book haul video. This is a new series that I started
which is very casual, completely unscripted where I just go through the books that I've bought for
the month. I tend to do a book haul every single month and I thought, hey, why not share what I'm
buying? Hopefully it adds as an impetus or some sort of inspiration for you to read some of these
books and delve into some of these thinkers. I certainly love watching other people's book haul
videos. It's something I get a lot of. It's kind of like eating fast food for me, just pure stimulation
and pleasure from looking at all the books that people buy because I happen to be a bibliophile
and fanatical one, in fact. Apart from that, I'll probably will discuss why I chose to buy
this particular book in this point in my life. What's the reason that I'm interested in this
particular book or this thinker and whatnot? But again, it's nothing planned. It's nothing
scripted. It's just me, stream of consciousness just talking. That's it. Without further ado,
let's get started. So the first book is Phenomenology, The Basics by Dan Zahabi. I believe that's how
you pronounce its name. I literally found this book over at it. I kind of went through this before.
I think I got a PDF or something, but I did refer to this a couple of times when I was writing a few
essays. And obviously Phenomenology, a topic that I'm deeply interested in. I think I'm
essentially a Phenomenologist and many other things, but that's one thing I am for sure.
And though it's funny, I bought this book because I'm currently writing an essay that I started
writing out of sheer annoyance at James Lensie. This guy is kind of like right-wing anti-woke
person who said that all Phenomenology, and so he said that all leftism is just an
is a byproduct. Leftism is inspired by this philosophical Phenomenology, which simply asserts
that subjectivity is truth. And I saw that and I thought that is completely not true. That is
fake news. It really annoyed me. You can probably see even now. I read this tweet like months ago,
but even now I got totally annoyed by that because it's a complete caricature and mischaracterization
of what Phenomenology is. And therefore I started writing this essay called what Phenomenology is
not. So I want to kind of try to understand Phenomenology by what it isn't. And I feel like
it's funny. I think the more I started to delve into philosophy and theory, I've realized that
sometimes the best way to grok a concept and understand a concept is by stating what it isn't
instead of stating what it is. In some sense, even at least for me, it kind of sits better in my mind.
So I bought this book. I'm certainly going to get to this soon. And the reason is because I want to
hopefully publish that essay, perhaps in about two months, because I'm working on another one
right now, got too many, too many essays pulling me from all sides. And you know, I'm really not
getting anything done. Unfortunately, that's just something that I tend to worry about quite a lot.
Ah, the pleasures. So that's why I bought this book. It's in fact to write an essay. I want to get
through all the basics as the name suggests. And the next book is an event perhaps a biography of
Jacques Darida by Peter Salomon, a Salomon, sorry, not not Salomon, Peter Salomon. And this was
recommended by R.C. Walden, if I could find the video where he did recommend the book.
So I think it was called R.C. Walden, Continental Philosophy or something. Let me see if I could
find the video. So I love watching R.C. Robin, that's his name, Robin's videos.
There we go. Five interesting philosophy books, Continental Edition. And he recommended the book.
I'm pretty sure he recommended this book. Yes, and even perhaps. So I kind of want to get into
Darida and kind of post structuralist way of thinking. I really at the moment
just have like a very, very extremely peripheral, almost caricatured version of what
post structuralism is. And I thought something, something I really enjoy is, you know, as Nietzsche
said, all philosophy is a philosopher's biography is even before delving into the philosopher,
just sorry, the philosophy, trying getting an idea from where the philosopher's coming from,
which is rather antithetical to what Heidegger said about Ari Soto, that he was just someone who
was born, philosophized and died. No, I actually am interested in the philosopher. I don't know why,
but that's who I am. I generally am interested in the thinker and the background as to what,
the background in which the philosophy sits. So not just the thinker itself, but even the
context, the historical context, the culture period, all of that. So yeah, I'm keen to get
into this. I probably will get down with this first before getting into this, because this is
a small, well, I'm assuming it's a bit of a lie to read compared to like reading theory,
as say, because it's a biography. But anyway, that's that. The next one is, was a gift.
It was Far From the Madden Crowd by Thomas Hardy. I don't own any books by Thomas Hardy,
at least I don't think I do. And I kind of want to read Thomas Hardy, just like a
light read. I love reading philosophy, but at the same time, I really do want to read a lot more
fiction. But man, I'm just such a theory nerd, you know, I can't help myself. I'll probably read
like one work, I'll probably like read like one novel, but even that, like if I read Dostoevsky,
for instance, I want to read it from like a philosophical lens, I can't just read it
as a book or as a work of fiction, because I'm such a theory nerd. But nonetheless,
this is a book was recommended by a few friends. I hope that it was quite good.
And I hope that it kind of goes into, oh, as the, what's this called bibliography state,
so vividly portraying the superstitions and traditions of a small rural community,
far from the madden crowd shows the precarious position of a woman in a man's world. So it
certainly seems interesting. And then this book, now the ethics of ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir.
Of course, everyone knows who Simone de Beauvoir is, at least anyone who's marginally interested
in philosophy. Simone de Beauvoir, of course, is known for her magnum opus, the second sex, but
a lot of YouTubers, in fact, philosophy YouTubers that I, if you respect, have recommended this
book because at least from my understanding, I think Simone de Beauvoir has a much more reasonable,
let's say, oh, oh, I haven't got the word for it, but let's just say realistic and take that word
with a grain of salt. I don't know if that's a proper word. Realistic,
realistic, let's say like encapsulation of reality, if that makes sense, or what life is
for a human being, for a design. Because, you know, Jean-Paul Sartre, he kind of has this idea of
like the transcendent consciousness that is free-floating consciousness everywhere. But
given that Simone de Beauvoir was a woman in a time where I believe when she was writing,
women couldn't even work without getting permission from men or something, but even in France,
you know, kind of the, it was a very progressive country for the time, nonetheless, that was deep,
she lived in a deeply patriarchal system. Therefore, her understanding, her understanding of
of what it means to exist in the world, especially being a woman, I think is a lot more
realistic because she talks about this kind of contradiction between being a free being,
but also the fact that we are, in fact, in a structure, in a society, in a historical period,
we also have this kind of, there's a word by Portolek, there's a term by Portolek,
what's, let me, let me try to look it up because I just referred to it, let me see if I could,
it's in this, oh, I think it was masculinity and nothing else. Yes, so in this essay I did quote
to like, let me see if I could find it. Man is essentially finite freedom, this idea of finite
freedom, that doesn't mean we're not free, but our freedom comes within a certain structure that,
in some sense, makes the freedom finitude, it's not like this free-floating Sartrean consciousness
that we just can do whatever we want. And, you know, perhaps Sartre wrote from a position of
privilege being a man in France in the, in his time, Simone de Beauvoir had a different experience
being a woman. So this book beautifully captures that kind of ambiguity to existence, this kind of
almost antagonism of what it means to be human. And, and then, of course, the ethical and moral
implications that come from it. So I'm really dedicated to this. This is probably going to go
right to the top of my list of books to read. Perhaps once I'm done with this one, because I'm
writing an essay, I'll probably get on this. So, certainly excited to read The Ethics of
Ambiguity by Simone de Beauvoir. And then comes the next one. So, it's This Big Boy,
Less Than Nothing by my hero, Slavoj D탑ek. This is a book that I will jump into this year for
sure. The reason being, this year, I kind of set myself a goal in terms of my education and my
studying in, in philosophy. It was to, it was to deeply study two of my two, two of, well, I would
say that the two main thinkers that I've influenced my life to this moment in the deepest possible way,
Paul Tolik and, of course, Slavoj D탑ek. So, studying these two thinkers, of course, means
studying all the other thinkers that influence them. So, it's a huge project that I've set for
myself. And I, I want to embark on it. I'm kind of already embarked on it, let's say. And that is,
that means going through essentially the, the magnum opuses. So, for Paul Tolik, it would be,
I probably would be systematic theology, the monograph. It's got three volumes and I only do,
I just am slowly getting through that. But then for Slavoj D탑ek, a lot of people who read D탑ek
quite deeply recommend this book and the parallax view. So, this is his book on Hegel.
Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism. So, this is certainly something I'm going to
jump into soon because I want to get a better understanding of Hegel. I, I don't know. It's
funny. I just had a conversation with P.F. Young, a great guy, Paul. And I realized that I was
trying to explain to him the Hegelian triad and I think I totally butchered it. I wasn't even,
I wasn't even sure if I should take that bit out because I didn't want to misrepresent Hegel.
But I just thought, hey, look, it's a conversation. We were just chatting. It was really casual. So,
if I, if I'm just spewing bullshit, someone will correct me and if I'm not, I'll hopefully
correct myself sometime in the future when I have a better understanding of Hegel. So,
definitely I'm going to work on this. In fact, if it's possible, it's, it's a big boy. I might even
do a lecture series on this book if it's within my capacity because, man, it's a lot to get through.
The next one is Religion and Nothingness by Nishitani, K.G. Nishitani. Of course,
a book that John Oveiki has recommended many times. In fact, in his latest lecture series, which is
what was it? After Socrates, is it? Oveiki. Yes, in his lecture series,
I think in episode five, he states that this was in the top five books that he's read.
And John Oveiki is also someone I really like. I really enjoy listening to his work. Despite,
interestingly, I think theoretically, his point of views or his understanding of reality is a lot
more different to the other thinker that I, I would consider myself a Zhezhekian. So,
Slavoj Zhezhek and John Oveiki probably have this conflict, fundamental conflict in their,
in their theories. It's interesting just to go for a bit of a tangent here. I think a lot of the
modern debate between different intellectuals is kind of between, there's Freud and then there's
Jung and then there's Lacan. And I think it's between these three thinkers. So, everyone,
everyone influenced by Freud, Jung, Lacan, they go their own way and create their own philosophies,
and that's where the conflict lies. So, John Oveiki would probably be more of a union,
less than a Freudian, and then Zhezhek would be more of a Freudian and Lacanian. So, all Lacanian.
So, that's where the conflict lies. Nonetheless, just, just thinking out loud here.
The next book is Capital by Thomas Piketty. I, I listened to a recent episode on Pillspot.
I love this channel so much. I don't know the guy's real name. I don't think he probably goes by
his pseudonym online, Pillspot, and they had this episode where they talk about, it's called The
Idea of Communism. It's very interesting. It was in fact done on a, I believe, an event that
Alan Baizho and a few other thinkers, you know, mainstream leftists, or the popular leftist
intellectuals of our time, got together and discussed the idea of communism. So, it's important
to understand here. It's the word idea. That's the concept of communism. It's not about the
practical implementations. Different thing. And they did mention this book, not Pills, per se,
but another guest on the podcast did mention this book, Capital by Thomas Piketty. And I know
it's another big one. I don't know if I'll get into it this year. Hopefully. Definitely, I want to
first get through rejects book on Hegel. But maybe after that, I'll get into this book. And the reason
I like it is because as much as I love philosophy and concepts, I also do look for, you know, practical
material implementations of these concepts. It's something, you know, I think as a person who's
politically involved has to think about, it can't all be philosophizing at one point. It has to be
implementation. This is perhaps my engineering side coming in. And they discussed that Thomas Piketty
just gives some very tangible practical solutions as to how we can live in a post-capitalist
society, as to how we can implement new systems that make society more egalitarian and ensure that
there's less suffering in this world. And it's a new way of thinking about capital, as the name
suggests, in the 21st century, because we do live in a post-capitalist society. And I think society
is, you know, I mean, over here, I'm a complete Joachim. I think the only universal is conflict.
I think the only universal is antagonism. So in some sense, in a very Nietzschean way, society is
about constantly recreating ourselves and then broader society. There never is the good old days,
nor will there ever be the utopia that some people might aspire to have. Therefore,
there never is the end of history. That never happens, as Francis Fukuyama suggested. At least,
that's my current understanding. And that's it. Those are the books. I hope you all enjoyed
this book haul. Sorry if I'm blubbering. I kind of did that intentionally because, well,
this is not a scripted thing. It's just me thinking out loud here. And if there are any other books
that you think are, let's say, tangentially related to these books that I discussed, please do leave
them down in the comment section. And I'll be keen to check them out and perhaps even end up buying
them. But thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one, not only the next book haul, but even
in the next video, which probably, well, I've got one on my mother world, the software engineering
world where I'm doing on effective Java, which I shall record soon. And then the other one is a,
I'm excited for this, actually, a Twitter space that I'll be hosting, not hosting, sorry, I'll be a
guest in with my brother, Ian Go, who I'm hoping I have on the podcast soon because this guy,
I love him to death, but also the smart bloke. So it would be interesting to have a conversation
with him. Cool. See you in the next one. Take care. Cheers.
