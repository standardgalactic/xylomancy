In this episode, I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, my kind of invitation would be,
he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences, like the experience of being tired,
the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the tasks that you're supposed to do,
our experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone at the end of the day.
And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to broader patterns,
broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable, I think.
He keeps, he doesn't keep a discussion of private experiences at that level, at that scope, at that
original scope of interest. Yes, of course we're interested in it, but he helps us make sense of
it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts. And with the help of different thinkers,
he introduces us to a host of other valuable thinkers, like Foucault, Plato, Nietzsche,
Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting the moments in our thought,
in a discussion, with the right moments, the right person.
Hey everyone, welcome to my conversation with the cognitive psychologist,
writer, fellow bibliophile, and now someone who I can hopefully call my friend,
Dr. Davood Gosley. This certainly was a conversation that I expected to be amiable
and good-natured, and it certainly was. My expectations were met. I've been following
Davood's book reviews for about a year now, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. And, you know,
a couple of months ago, I noticed that he's done a lot of reviews on Berkshire Harnes' work,
and they were fantastic reviews. They weren't mere cheap summaries where you quickly get across
what the book says, but rather he critiqued them, he discussed the ideas that spoke to him more
deeply, and they always came from his point of view, despite him reviewing the work of another
thinker. And this got me thinking, perhaps I've always wanted to do an episode or a podcast
dedicated to exploring Berkshire Harnes, and I thought Davood would be the perfect candidate
to converse with. And I hope I was a good interlocutor and brought up the best of both Davood
and Berkshire Harnes' work, but you'd be the judge of that. We spoke about a variety of topics.
We discussed Davood's experience in academia, both it's good and bad, perhaps mostly bad,
unfortunately, and also some of the ideas of living in neoliberal society and the logic of
neoliberalism, and then explode some of the concepts that Berkshire Harnes has introduced to the
contemporary critical theory dialogue, let's say. But also in many ways, I was joking around
during the episode, but I kind of meant in some sense too that, sorry, I've got a bit of a cold,
that I do want this episode to be some kind of propagandistic conversation for you to go
read the work of Berkshire Harnes, because I do think it can bring great value to your life,
especially in the society and culture we live in, where a lot of the problems are made private
and personalized when some of them really aren't private in the first place. They are social
problems, but we discussed this in detail during the conversation, so I won't get into it right
now. That being said, as I tend to do a bit of a formal introduction to Davood, Dr. Davood Gosley
is a cognitive psychologist. He received his PhD from the University of Toronto. He has held
research and teaching positions at the University of Vienna, Leiden University, and the University of
Macau. He's the author of many scholarly articles and a book titled Experimental Psychology and Human
Agency. Dr. Gosley has a YouTube channel where he posts book reviews spanning a vast array of
writers and genres from Heruki Murakami to Bianca Harnes and fiction to critical theory. He also
runs a book club organized through his Patreon page. Having said that, here's my conversation with
Dr. Davood Gosley, where we discuss the work of Bianca Harnes. It's really interesting. I think I
subscribe more to kind of the Todd McGovern, in fact, wrote a book about this, which I'll be talking
to him soon. It's called Embracing Alienation. I find that I don't try to, at least personally,
I don't let myself kind of be too attached, overly attached to the kind of the socio-symbolic
order of a certain culture. I don't really, despite being a dual citizen, just like in terms of
formally, I don't really think of myself as like a Sri Lankan Australian or, you know, it's not
something I attach myself to too much. Certainly my home is Australia, but yeah, don't get me wrong.
I'm not like a hippie that's like, oh, I'm a globalist. No, we need a home. I think, you know,
we need a place, a recall home. But I, I guess to be succinct, it's I try to not think too much about
like, which culture am I a part of? What's like my true unique, you know, authentic culture? Because
as I think Jejeck puts this well, cultures themselves aren't authentic in themselves. They
themselves have this like, ontological incompleteness, let's say, so. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes people go
after having a culture day. They turn that into a project, expecting it to provide them with something,
something very stable and final and help them get rid of that sense of alienation once and for all.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you turn that into that kind of turn it into that kind of project,
I think that would be disappointing, ultimately. Yeah, because unfortunately, I don't know what
your thoughts on this, David, especially given you're much closer to the US than I am. I mean,
there's a there's a rise in nationalism, right? And I think a lot of them are looking for this,
the big other, the stable big other, and they want to fully attach themselves with it. And then
it's from there, they have this like, sense of stability, which at least since modernity,
subjects have never had in the world. We like, Todd McGovern says that kind of the
one sign of modernity is that all subjects are alienated. We don't have a home in some sense.
None of us are rooted in a home.
But yeah, I think I mean, Todd McGovern, I mean, I like him a lot. But what does he know about
being really alienated? Being living in a living in a place that nobody speaks his language? I mean,
sure, theoretically, I follow him to I follow him to but there's there are different degrees of
being out of place. Some of them are more visceral. I agree. Some of them are more like you have to
really think your way to them. But to be in a place and everybody's pointing at you and saying,
oh, look at the foreigner, or is that is that foreigner going to stay here with us? Yeah,
that's that's like very in your face. And I since I've experienced that, I mean, that's
maybe that's not exactly what he's talking about. But maybe it is maybe it's like,
you know, I think I totally get your point there because like I remember when I came here,
like when I was a kid, much younger, even things like, I mean, I think Canada is okay.
But like a lot like Australian slang and colloquialisms, I was kind of what the hell are people talking
about, you know, and like, it's not even the direct judgment or the gaze of the others just
generally me, myself, I'm trying to see where the hell do I fit in here. And then what I even the
reason top McGovern's work was really helpful was to be honest, I agree with you, I think there are
like certain limits as like, like, there are like, some of it can be a lot more palpable and visceral,
was that because I realized, oh, the trick is to kind of embrace your alienation to not like,
to not as a not I don't try to this used to be the case where I tried to like overly attach
myself with a certain culture, be the Australian culture or the Sri Lankan culture, which is the
culture that I'm at, then, you know, I was born and raised in. But I realized no, no, no, that's
all of that is fine. Like, I'm not, I'm not going to actively negate that side of me, of course,
not that's impossible. But also, I won't overly attach myself and be like, Oh, this is why I'm
this is the true core of my being. I like the whole kind of idea that in some sense,
at the core, what we are is like this kind of abyss or like a void. It at least for me being again,
being a migrant, probably that that's probably the reason I like that idea a lot more than
trying to find like an authentic kernel of who I am as a subject. Right, I see, I see.
I feel like this is this can be a this can be a long conversation.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely talk about this. Hopefully we'll be on with this.
But I can see how that could connect to your interest in cognitive science as well, because
that's tacitly cognitive science has that attitude of not too much being attached to any particular
culture. Interesting. What sense would you say? It's a very non-culture in general. I think cognitive
science, cognitive psychology has a very non-cultural view of human nature, of a human being
and human thinking. It kind of brackets out the idiosyncratic, local, regional practices,
regional, I mean, idioms of language. Everything becomes neat and formulaic and trans,
maybe because you say transparent, not these like interpretive, indirect,
you know, a cognitive psychologist or cognitive scientist doesn't necessarily,
doesn't, I mean, habitually or typically pick out these indirect communications,
communication practices of cultures where you have to be immersed in a culture to know how to
decode a given sign. You know, that's what I mean. I see. It tries to be like trans-cultural in
some sense or beyond cultures. Yeah. No, I think you're right, because in fact, I'm going to start
my master's program next year and it's partially in cognitive science. It's a research program
and I think I'm more, let's say, I find more affinity with those kinds of studies because
something that also bothers me at the Buddhist is kind of like, sometimes people get into this,
like, they focus too much on like the particularities, like either feminist or Marxist or black or
white and at one point that's very exhausting. You know, it's like, yeah, I get it. We all have
particular identities, but what about the universal? And that's why I'm more caught up in like,
I like the sciences because there is this kind of universalistic with that has its negatives too,
for sure. It's a very absolutist, but I prefer that. I think you hit the nail on the head,
that idea that we can go beyond the particular into something a bit more universal.
Yeah, what you said partly is cognitive science. The other part, is it philosophy?
It's philosophy, that's correct. Yeah. Okay, nice.
So I'm by the philosophy department, but they have like, it's a very interesting
program, like they kind of in tandem with some cognitive science fields. So I'm looking forward
to it. You're going for it. Yeah, man. I'm like, I kind of want to do what you did, you know,
go through the whole process, get my PhD, and then who knows, it might end up becoming a
but not academic, but I'm going to do it regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good luck.
Thank you, man. Thank you. In fact, I might come to you in the future for some advice.
I hope I can.
No, I'd always be appreciative of that. But yeah, as I said, David, sorry for my, you know,
raspy voice. I'm getting over a cold. I'm telling you, it's not. You sound fine. You sound great.
Thank you, man. Yeah, look, so what we kind of are hoping to do today is to discuss
Bianchal Han's work and sort of let's do it in some sense, propagandize as to why you should
read Bianchal Han. But before that, David, I thought a rather pertinent question would be,
my God, you've got over 400, I think book reviews, probably a couple of hundred on
your YouTube channel. And you're an avid reader. And from different genres, certainly.
But I want to ask you a question, which I think a lot of ink has been spilled over,
which is how does one read philosophy and theory well?
You know, Rahul, in general, I am, I find it very difficult to adopt that perspective,
adopt that position of how does one do this and that? I know it's very attractive to go
for that perspective and formulate a kind of advice, generalities, general guidelines.
I can talk, I find it easier to talk about the things that I have,
I have kind of slowly settled into the kind of perspective I've settled into and maybe what
I would say to myself, to my past self, maybe 10 years ago. In fact, in fact, I know that you're
not the advice giving type in any way, but perhaps that's a better way to say it. What would you
say to your past self? But there is that, that temptation to give advice and ask for advice,
both are very strong. And it's the, it's a temptation to be, to take a, to, to help the other
person save some time. You know, I really want other people to not go through this inefficient
process that I went through. But that's my mistake when I give to that, give in to that temptation,
because everybody needs to go through their own inefficient process, their own inefficient journeys,
they own, they own, they own set of wrong books, the books that they will later be embarrassed
to admit that they liked, they enjoyed. Okay, so back to the question, see if I can retrieve it,
if I can remember it. How does one read philosophy? I mean, literally,
yeah, slowly, you know, slowly without rush, trying to not do too much.
I always have this, I mean, I had it more, like, I just as to pick one example, the person that you
read, one of the people you recently interviewed that I really admire, Simon Grishley. I have,
when I become interested in somebody like, let's say Grishley, I was like, okay, here's a list of
all Simon Grishley books, I'm going to start chronologically from beginning to the end,
and read them all. And see, read all the other people that he was influenced by.
And okay, if I replicate that whole process, what's going to happen? I will catch up to Simon
Grishley. Okay, that's like, by that time, I'm like seven years old or something, some, some age
like that. I've replicated, I've tried to replicate Simon Grishley's reading and writing life.
I mean, that's not a practical thing to do. And I don't think it's very useful.
It's better to be, to accept that maybe I'll read one or two books by this thinker.
And by the time I'm finished with the second book, maybe I'm too busy with some of their
projects, some of the tasks, maybe my life will be interrupted by some facts of life,
maybe ill health or, you know, losing a job or whatever. And then, when I get back to philosophy,
I'm interested in some other topic or some other, some other thinker. So embracing all those
limitations, all those, the negativity of the reading life, to borrow Byung-chohan's
and others, Byung-chohan really brought this back and urged us to think in terms of negativity,
to, to embrace that. All those, all those features that are, that are negative, you know,
lack of speed, I'm not going to be as fast as I, as I want to be. I'm not going to read as
exhaustively as I want to be. I'm not going to remember as much as I want to remember, you know,
so, so often I read again a text, it's like, oh, I can't believe I read this before. This is so fresh,
this is so new. And this, there's this other kind of experience that you feel like I was never in
a position to really appreciate this text until now. The passage by Nietzsche, you know, it was just
after reading maybe something by Freud, and he returned to a passage, a paragraph from Beyond
Good and Evil, and he realized, oh my god, what did I read before? I totally missed this. So,
sorry to give a long answer to that. No, that's a great question. I really liked the last one,
because I think in a conversation you had with Daniel Ghana, you know, OG Rose, they're lovely,
I want to speak to them soon, but I want to first read that book before I have them on.
He, he said a similar thing where, especially Nietzsche, because it's very aphoristic,
so you'd read a bit of Nietzsche, and then you come back to him, let's say, two, three years later,
and it's like a totally different author, you know, a totally different book in some sense.
Yeah, I think for me, and I see this, probably it's more for your temperament, because you're a bit
of a calmer person, because I'm a bit of a neurotic person, and I like action, you know, like I'm a
typical, what do you call this, burnout subject in some sense, you know, like I like, I like this
kind of making, you know, Björn Scholland talks about making yourself into a project. You make
yourself into like an entrepreneur of the self, right? And, and therefore, a part of me does
like that, because I enjoy it, but also the problem with that is I don't appreciate, as you pointed
out, the slowness, and like having the patience, and even like that negativity where you detach
yourself from this, let's call it a noise, or the hyperpositivity, and just sit with an idea,
if it's for hours, if it's just like a verse or an excerpt from a book, hours and even days,
and just like kind of meditating on it. And I found that that can be a lot more valuable than trying
to read 60 pages in a day, or try to like, hit some reading quota, albeit me.
Yeah, yeah, I'm, you know, the older I get, the less I can relate to those things like reading
quota, like reading 200 pages a day, like, why? For what purpose? Because the ultimate,
the ultimate effect of these reading life is you want the effect to show up when, for example,
you are talking to a kid, like a nine-year-old, eight-year-old kid. That's where, you know,
it's a critical moment where you want to behave somewhat wisely when there is a sensitive person
who is listening to you, or you're dealing with somebody, and if you're reading 200 pages a day,
you're exhausting yourself, and you're being patient probably when you meet that, you know,
kid or student or a person who is really receptive to you, open to you at that moment.
I think we should keep an eye out for those moments where we want the impact of our reading life to
show up. You know what I mean? Because it's all for something, you know, it's supposed to be for
something, and that something is there are very limited chance moments, there are very limited
moments of our lives where you want to be like, I try to be a somewhat decent person, and reading
is hopefully part of that. Interesting. So for you, you always see reading as a, to put it
crassly as like a means to an end, because for me personally, I find Davoud that I
read for its own sake. Like, I don't expect anything out of it. Well, some books I do,
especially if it's like preparing for like my studies or the podcast, but some other books,
I read them for their own sake. That's a good point. You want to read for its own sake, but
not purely. I mean, there's there's a limit to that. Because sometimes it's work. Sometimes it's,
it doesn't seem like you're doing it for its own sake, because you're putting the, putting extra
effort in. But yeah, that's why I kind of reach out for some purpose, some other thing outside of
the intrinsic enjoyment. But yeah, I relate to reading for its own sake too, as something that
is otherwise. Yeah. Now, I certainly see that because like, especially, you know, this is a
beautiful thing about with all of its discontents, the internet, and this kind of new podcasting,
whatever you may call it, book, booktube community that's being built up. It's like,
given life of the mind or reading to use a bit of a pretentious term can be a, you know, very
solitary thing. It's just lovely to see people that are that truly cherish it, cherish it as
much as we do. And we connect with them through the internet. And that for me, despite growing up
with the internet, I've never gotten over the fact that you could just like you're in Canada,
and I'm here in Australia, and we both connect over this shared love for, for reading and learning.
I'll never, you know, get over that fact, that data. Sure, sure. But you know, there are all
these people who cherish reading, but they show the cherishing moments when they turn on the camera
they say how much they cherish that the activity of reading, but the camera is off most of the
time. And they don't always cherish it. I mean, we don't, I don't, I don't always enjoy reading.
And I don't, I don't have a very simple, always filled with pleasure relationship with reading.
Interesting. To me, life of the mind is, is full of suffering and uncertainty.
To struggle, to struggle. I agree. I mean, I joke around, I joke around. I say that I'm probably
a bit of like a masochist, because it's such a struggle to like, I mean, try to read like Hegel
right? I'm like, God, what the hell is this guy talking about? And I, or like, like Cohen, for
instance, and then it's like, what, but nonetheless, you persevere. And it's never like a walk in the
park and like a very pleasant experience. It's a struggle for sure that I agree. I couldn't agree
more with that. Yeah. All right, David. So, the actual hand getting, getting back to the actual
hand. What, what, you know, especially being a cognitive psychologist, what would you say,
what firstly attracted his work, because he's a critical theorist after all, what attracted
you towards his work, but also what isomorphism similarities do you see between cognitive psychology
and the work of the actual hand? Oh, I, let's first talk about how I got into his work. So, I,
it was by accident. I have a friend who is here in Toronto, and he gave me a copy of
The Agony of El Ross. And I noticed the kind of book it is first, I noticed, yeah,
it's very short. It's, you know, 50 something pages, I think, 53 pages, excluding the notes.
And I didn't read it immediately. I just read a couple of pages and said, okay, I know, I know
what the kind of thing that he's writing about. And three, four years later, I kept running into
Han's work in bookstores. And I said, okay, I'm going to do that thing. I'm going to
chronologically read his work beginning with the first burnout society.
And so I started. And yeah, that's, that was my entry. I don't want to, you know, you asked about
the relationship or possible relationships between cognitive science and
Han. And this is difficult for me to say, given that you, you have this exciting
project of going into cognitive science now. So I don't kind of, I'm hesitant to say this,
but for me, let's say my own particular relationship with cognitive science, I don't
have a very high opinion of it. So I would say, for me, becoming increasingly critical of cognitive
psychology, the experimental method as applied to the study of human beings.
Han became, eventually, he became one of the resources for me to think about
the conduct of psychologists, my colleagues in academia. So when he talked about, you know,
the shrinking of time, we don't have this long view or relationship with
time as something that link that can linger that continues, that covers a long span that
our form of consciousness is structured such that time is very brief for us that we have this
metaphorically, at least ADHD-like kind of subject, subjectivity where at any given moment,
we want to say wow and be surprised and being pressed by a research project in cognitive
psychology. I felt like every meeting, every kind of departmental presentation, it started from scratch,
no history, no memory, a quick presentation and a quick wow. And soon after it was done,
that's it, it was gone. So you become like, it becomes a piece of entertainment and a piece of,
you know, easy, quick persuasion. And if you look back, there's not much relationship between
different projects that people are pursuing. And so when I read and thought with Han, I became
kind of aware of this, this thing that was my career, this is just one expression of
something bigger that Han is talking about, namely the neoliberal order, the neoliberal subject of
which, you know, one way it shows up is in research, research projects, projects, you know,
in general. Yeah, projects, yeah. Yeah, in fact, I recall in one of the videos, I think the one
you made on psychopolitics, you even mentioned that in academics, like, because again, we're all part
of the old immersed in the neoliberal symbolic order, let's say, right? And academics constantly
love coming out with new terms, new words, new ideas, it's a novelty, we know, we fetishize
novelty. And that is because we have this kind of almost imperative to create, to produce.
Yeah, you got to have a thing academia, you got to have your thing. Exactly. Yeah.
That's fascinating. That's fascinating. But first of all, David, I want to say I really do,
that means a lot to me that you took my personal career into into account when
replying to that, because I mean, look, I, it's interesting, I know the I've spoken to many
people like yourself, who are academics, who've been through this journey. And I know it's it's
certainly has its own problems to, you know, university itself, the neoliberal university
has its shortcomings. And in fact, perhaps it's it's it's becoming another corporation,
unfortunately, like, like, what we see in the rest of society. So, I mean, in fact,
you're gonna say, please, but I would never discourage you to, I would never discourage you
from pursuing that way of life, because the problems that we attribute to university life
are not unique to it. Indeed. We become we become disappointed. Yeah, we become disappointed and
disillusioned to find that university is not special, that it also has all those problems
that we find in the corporate world, for example. So that's, I mean, there are there are still a
lot of good things about having having a life in university, you know, teaching and thinking and
writing. It's still there's still a lot of good in it. I should emphasize that for me, after,
you know, six years, plus the PhD, getting the PhD, that was another five years postdoc one year.
So about 11 years after about 11 years, I realized, you know, I had enough of this.
I want to do something else, I want to create something else. And I it really became a question
for me, like, if I don't do this, what would my life be like? What else could it be? So it was,
I needed to become independent of this thing that I continuously criticized. Because you can't,
I mean, I, in good conscience, can't continue to criticize something while depending on it,
still, while still getting my salary from it and say, Oh, I hate this. So I wanted to live
with more integrity. So you know what, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, or I want to,
I want to really like really mean this, I mean this critique, I mean it enough to say,
I don't want to devote my life to it anymore. Well, in fact, let's let's go here, let's go a
bit, delve a bit deeper into this, because, you know, let's let's bring in the actual hands,
you know, psychopolitics, excellent book, kind of he, you know, critiques neoliberalism. So
in the context of academia and the university, David, what would you say in your view is like
the ideal, like the platonic idea, whatever you may call the ideal of university. And then what is
the current in actuality of the university we have in, let's say, most of the world, which people
like Ben Shulhan are critical of? Wow, that's a very difficult question. I, you know, we have to,
that probably deserves a kind of roundtable discussion with a lot of people for me and help
getting to that ideal, unpacking that really. But just let's say that for me, the idea, the ideal of
university is not separable from the type of person that it's supposed to cultivate,
a form of life, a form of life that is thoughtful, that is interested, that is open to a certain kind of
wonder, a certain kind of openness, and keeps a certain mindset alive, keeps a certain spirit
alive, spirit of inquiry. So it's a form of being that university is the platform, it's the medium
for that form of life. So a lot is probably required for that. A lot of practices, a lot of support
goes into that structure. So it's a structure place where, you know, a certain form of life
can be supported. Right now is what we can say about university, how it deviates, is that people
still, I think people still have that in the back of their mind when they do their works. But
that ideal is something that is perpetually postponed. They will say things like, okay,
this year, I need to get these publications out. They're not important, I don't really believe in
them. But I need to publish these, these couple of papers to get the promotion. And after that,
I can focus on what I really want. But this thing, if you pay it, if you keep listening to people, if
you keep paying attention, you hear the repetition of this pattern that it's always later. And
ultimately, it's after they retire that they want to do the thing that they want to do. They
say typically in psychology was, people would say, I want to study consciousness after I retire.
That's a typical thing. Because it's... They get tenure, now that's stability. Yeah, yeah, tenure.
Tenure, yeah. But in some cases, even tenure is not enough. Because the department sometimes
turns against you if you do what you like to do after you get tenure. Because they say,
we hired you to do this type of research. Why did you stop?
Yeah, it becomes, I mean, deviation from the ideal, I would say, happens when it becomes about
performance and metrics, and the signs of accomplishment, the signs of success.
Yeah. And then in fact, perhaps you could connect us to that idea that
Viang Shul Han talked about his critique of big data. This goes really well, again,
with your previous point. It's about positivity, right? It's a measure of everything. Everything is
you become another statistic. You put it in a very cliched way. Whereas there's something in
thought, and in fact, he says it's theory that it's a negativity. It's not a positive thing.
You kind of remove yourself from being, and it's a different kind of mode of being.
Yeah. Remember, when big data was very hot and new, you probably remember this. There were these
statements like, now we have so much data that the need to think isn't, we don't have that need
anymore. People said that there was a statement about we don't need to think anymore, and we
don't need theory anymore. That definitely, I remember that hearing that, reading that.
All those things that we really want to become, to cultivate the capacity for those things,
capacity for thought, capacity for theory, these serious consideration of this upper topic or
subject matter, that requires lack and requires negativity, and also that having a relationship
with negativity. Big data, the way people think of it as providing us too much, more than we need,
we get so much that you almost become helpless. It's not up to you anymore after
some crossing some threshold. It's not up to us. We just submit to it. We submit to the big data.
Yeah. I mean, perhaps I'd say for me, the almost quintessential example of this is
health and fitness. You've probably noticed that people have the watch where they track their steps.
They track their sleep. They got the ring to track their pulse heartbeat. You completely
mechanize the human body to a point where I think in my view, it ends up harming you because
you burn out from that. You get fatigued from this constantly having to measure yourself.
In fact, a funny anecdote, one of my friends, I'm not going to mention her name obviously,
she even has almost like a Trello board or like a project management software she uses
to keep track of her dating, her dates. This person has these pros, these cons.
She's a lovely person. We get along really well, and we're quite close. I always kind of
make fun of her for this. Do you keep track of how many times you had sex per week and everything?
I even tell her personally, for me, if I live like that, I'd probably end up killing myself.
I mean, I can't think of anything more depressing than having to track everything
in that sense and making yourself a part of this big data ideology, let's say.
Yeah, that's very interesting. I haven't heard of anybody doing that, but we should
still ask like, what is that tracking doing? It might not be doing what it would do for us.
Maybe for some people, it just creates that sense of stability. It might not result in anything,
it might not lead anywhere, these dates that I'm going, but at least I have the records of it.
Yeah. For some people, that could be, they could write a novel about that. Maybe that's
similar to like a technological record keeping. Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with this.
This is, I mean, in fact, let me read out this quote, Davud. I was going to, this idea where
there's a lovely thing where it says, so the achievement subject, this is from the Bernard
Society. Bianca Hollande says, the achievement subject explodes itself until it burns out.
It, in the process, it develops auto-aggression that often enough escalates into the violence of
self-destruction. The project turns out to be a projectile that the achievement subject is aiming
at itself. And I think for me, this goes back to the idea that everything has to be a project,
right, including academia. And then the problem is, and just to kind of get at this bit,
but like high level, in the book, he talks about how in disciplinary society, kind of what Foucault
critiques, it's still a society of prohibition, right? You do, thou shall not, you shall not
have sex before marriage, you shall not, if you're gay, marriage is illegal, whatever you may call
it. Whereas in our society, in the society of the hyper-positivity, we achievement subjects,
everything is, yes, you can, yes, you should. And in that sense, I think we, we, we, all of us,
all of us, in no way am I like sitting on like a high chair, like pointing fingers, we all do this,
I know I do this, we make projects out of our life, and we ourselves become a project. So, and I think
Han puts it beautifully, we exploit ourselves. And to get back to this thing about what you said
about stability, I think there is, there is this idea, at least in my view, that this is feeling,
you do get some kind of safety when you feel like everything is tracked, everything is in order,
you know, everything, everything has a place, everything makes sense. Now, we don't know in
reality if that stability exists, but at least the ideology is, yes, my, my romantic life,
I can plan it out, I know, I'll know exactly who I'll meet, the kind of person I want, or the,
they'll tick all the boxes. And of course, in, at least in my view, what happens there is,
we are always, we're always surprised. In fact, I'd argue the paradox is, the more you try to
order your life, the more control you lose. Right, right. It just also occurred to me that, that,
that's the closer to the transparency society to, to keep records of everything. You're making
your dating life transparent to yourself, to yourself and potentially to other spectators,
that this is what I'm doing and I'm recording everything here. And the other thing that happens
with that is everything becomes the same, because person number one and person number seven,
because you kept track of them with respect to similar dimensions, they're comparable,
they all become comparable. And the otherness about them, their alterity is, is pushed aside.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could you elaborate on that point? I'm so glad you brought that up, the idea of
otherness and alterity, how that, how that's a part of our subjectivity in some sense.
Yeah, so I think that's, I mean, by, by definition, that's a difficult concept to articulate,
because it's always in what we call the other, truly other, is always the thing that is not
captured by the logic of our current project. Whatever that is not, that you're not capable
of, because of the way we have positioned ourselves, the kind of structure that we are
participating in. By virtue of that, the other is outside of that, and we are not ready to even
understand it. What we can do is to be, we could say vulnerable to it, we could become vulnerable
to its effects, like having an argument with, with, you know, with our significant other,
having something that a disagreement that seems irreconcilable, or having a problem with a stranger,
and not even knowing what the root of the problem is. So Han,
the identity, he argues that we are inclined to move in the direction of sameness, the tyranny,
or the terror of sameness, to impose structures and logic, kinds of logic,
when we deal with different kinds of situations, impose kinds of logic that simplifies
what we are encountering, and treats plurality in terms of same, so same kinds of stuff. So in
dating, for example, the example, very useful, we just number people, or the books, you know,
100 classics that you should read before you die, you know, that's like, that's also a kind of unfair
way of treating books, because you know, you want to hundreds, and one is probably the best,
100 is like, yeah, okay, you can skip that. But the logic of sameness is imposed on that,
on that list, you know, it turned the thing turns into a list. So it's, it's very interesting by,
by getting out of that, funny enough, the effect of that is the kind of liberation,
you will liberate ourselves by getting out of the logic of sameness.
The detail of that, the detail of that is, in a book that I haven't yet finished by Han,
is the expulsion of the other. But just like any, any of his books, it's great by really
continuing and, and illuminating what he has done in the previous books. So for example,
you just touched on the burnout society. And here he says this, he makes this really beautiful,
very insightful observation that, you know, he's talking about the new liberal regime and self
exploitation. Okay, but we perceive that self exploitation as freedom. And we are, we think
that we are self optimizing, self realizing. And he writes, here, there is no other as
exploiter to the, the exploiter is not another forcing me to work and alienating me from myself.
Rather, I voluntarily exploit myself in the belief that I am realizing myself. This is
the diabolical logic of neoliberalism. And then he writes, hence the first stage of a burnout
is euphoria. The first stage of burnout is euphoria. You're happy in the beginning.
I plunge into work euphorically until I finally collapse. This is, this is really,
it's a transferable insight. You might think about this type, there's a type of person who
gets in and out of relationships, and they get really passionate. When they start a relationship,
they get this euphoria of, I finally found the one. And of course, these problems they're waiting,
the problems are brewing from the very beginning. It's not that something goes wrong. No, the very
structure from the very beginning is set up for that huge heated disappointment to happen and
for the explosion, for a breakup to happen explosively. So this is now here in this passage.
Han is describing burnout as something that we set ourselves up for from the very beginning
when we euphorically start engaging with the project.
Indeed, like the absolute high and then the complete destruction, isn't it? That comes along
with it. Yes, they're part of the same pattern. Yeah, because we set it up through this kind of,
let's call it within our society, kind of what the ideology we hold all day to us.
And two points on that, David. One, are they really good example you used to this kind of
the massification of like sameness is traveling? I remember you, I think you used it in one of
your videos. And look, I'm not again anti-traveling. I'll be going on a holiday next month, in fact.
But I am very, very critical and I even find it, I'm a bit even, I even detest this idea that I
got to tick all the boxes every single city, Paris or Florence or Berlin and go to Europe,
especially because us Australians here, we're quite away from Europe, so love going to Europe.
And then the point you make is that it's kind of cheapens, you go to Paris, you stay there for
four days and you're like, I know Paris. But of course, that's not how you get to know a city.
And then that same ideology, it comes along to other human beings too. You start viewing
even humans, it's just another person, just another city, just another commodity.
Yeah, it's kind of, it's almost tragic that we get very close to
getting somewhere. You know, when you travel, when you go to Paris, you just get so,
it's such an opportunity. It's an amazing city, amazing history. You go there and then
people miss it. People miss the fact that it's supposed to be enjoyed, it's supposed to be an
experience, you're supposed to be surprised. And maybe you go through the Paris syndrome,
it's another whole thing. But to what I notice, unfortunately, the tragedy is that for some
people, it becomes about taking photos and then it doesn't become enjoyable until the moment they
are back and they show those pictures to their friends. That's when they start enjoying it.
I mean, that's just, I mean, that's kind of, that's a kind of sickness, isn't it?
But also, I think it's, you know, in the Transparency Society, he has one essay called
the Society of Exhibition, where you've got to exhibit your, it's like, until you got the
approval from the other, in this case, the gaze of the social media, it's as if you haven't really
done this thing. You know, and I think he says, the Society of Exhibition is a society of pornography,
that kind of hyper unconcealment. I really do like that, because it's like, it's as if we want to
get rid of this friction between us and the world. We want it to be completely seamless,
and there's no, it's just whatever it's in here, it has to be out there. Whereas for me, the subject,
what's really fascinating, and I think Djijek gets this point quite well, is that we are a
complete fisher in being, where it's this absolute negativity, that kind of, we kind of, in many
ways, we don't fit into the subject, doesn't fit into the order of things, because of this absolute
negativity that's created. And with this need to be completely transparent, we completely
jettison this negativity. Right. And that's where for me, traveling, because, you know,
if you think about it, I am all about, in some sense, I'm like a levinazi, and like, I really
believe in exposing yourself and opening yourself to the other. And travel, you could argue, is a
beautiful way to do that, you know, opening yourself to a completely different culture,
a different mode of being even. But if it becomes kind of like the whole, it's just going to become
a game for, you know, Instagram selfies, or spread up on the internet. There's no, there's
absolutely no opening yourself to the other, it's just simply another exhibition. It's another
box to take. Yeah, yeah. All the inconveniences of traveling, and people, the parts that we are
inclined to not appreciate, I mean, those are the real, those are the moments where we encounter
what is not planned, what is the real justification for getting out, getting, getting into the,
indeed, into the journey. Just, it's a really good point you make about the inconvenience,
because I know you've been on Kareel last, philosophy podcast, his podcast, love his work, I
mean, I feel like the, the, I'm hoping to talk to him one day, I'm probably going to have like one
of those moments, because he was one of the first people that I, his channel was the resource for
me to understand, you know, probably five years ago, I went through his lectures and then Hegel,
and he's an amazing, amazing elucidator. But anyway, let me get that aside. He has this point
about inconvenience, he says that, you know, we, we have these kinds of conversations online, and
it's fantastic, like it's just, it's like an oasis of where we could just get lost in this world of
thinking and theory and philosophy. But he does say there is something very convenient about this,
right? As in, let's say, you and I, we wanted to have the same conversation in person. You're
in Canada, I'm in Australia, we may have to organize our flights, take up a lot of time from our day,
and there's like a lot of friction for us to have this in person. But now all I had to do was just,
I mean, I sent you an email and a bit of back and forth, but that's nothing compared to, and then,
you know, click a button, zoom video opens up, all of that friction is taken away. And I wonder
if there will be some kind of richness that comes out of this friction, if it is in person,
and how, in the future of like this kind of what we're doing in this community, how that would
be where I'm, I'm trying to see as I grow this community, if I can do a bit, a few more in person
events in Australia, just so that there's something, the difficulty of that itself
makes it worth it, if I could put it that way. Yeah, that's a great idea to do more in person
stuff. Just, you know, if you and I just to use this to stay with this example, if you and I were
planning to meet, it could not just be, because it's such a big distance between us, it can just be
like, okay, we talk for an hour and then bye, see you later. It has to be like, okay, if you're
visiting, you know, I have to kind of help accommodate you, help find accommodation for
you or vice versa. It becomes more than what we were initially interested in, we have to embrace
more, we have to kind of accept that there's going to be more inconvenience for this, you know,
a small slice of interaction that I was planning, I'm supposed to, I'm forced to have like a whole
bunch of unplanned, you know, but necessary, it's going to be a lot of necessary evil in that process.
Technology is really, it's good at eliminating all those and giving us just that one slice,
precisely the slice that you asked for, you're going to get it and then turn it off, turn off the
zoom and you're done. But there's a, we can, we can be skeptical of that, that purity.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I've always been skeptical of this idea of like pristine purity, refined things,
I, I, I, here's a game where I'm sorry, I keep referring to Jack, he is one of my master signifiers,
I refer to him a lot because I'm essentially my ontology is dejected ontology. And like he always
talks about that, yeah, there's something, it's in the, it's in the, the flaws, it's in the,
the lopsidedness, it's in the, the antagonisms, whatever they call it, it's in the error itself,
in some sense, the answer lies. And, and I liked the idea that complete order is felt,
that's fascism, but also complete disorder, that's anarchism, right? So I'm not trying to say you
need to get, find the best of both. But I think that the trick is to find disorder in the order.
And to see that, okay, yeah, yeah, things can be seamless, but there's some, there's value to
things going wrong too. An example is that way, you know, when the Frenchie jokes around,
when the cheese went off, the French took that, that error, the thought, and now we have blue cheese,
or with wine, it went off, now we have champagne. So it's to find something positive in the error,
something productive in the error itself. Yeah, yeah, philosophy itself could be an error in
normal conversation, you know, in normal discourse, you know, there was this guy Socrates, for example,
he kind of introduced weird variations in questioning people and questions and answers.
But to make that official, to officially bring that into conversation,
that would be the, the active philosophy, the decision.
And speaking of, I would like to revisit the agony of heroes, because this is certainly,
I think, but I think it's the same for you, burnout and agony of heroes are my favorite.
I've only read probably four or five of his books. So I certainly love this book.
One point I want to make about the agony of heroes, and I don't know what your thoughts on this are.
So we talk a lot about this, like the other and how the other can be a complete alien other,
and then they kind of disturb our sameness, our controlled life. But I really like the kind of
notion that Alan Bajor makes that, yes, it's true that the other is completely alien. You can never
plan the love event in that sense. But when, when, when, when to love, he says love takes two.
And in the event of love, by allowing yourself to like opening yourself up to the other,
there is a higher truth or a newer truth created. So love becomes a project in that sense. So it's
not that the other is a complete alien, and then, you know, your life is complete chaos. But through
this, again, it's paradoxically through opening yourself up to this other, you've, in some sense,
you find a truth even about yourself. And I'm wondering, like, I don't know if that makes
sense. I'm sorry if I'm being a bit long winded. No, no, no, no. Just like if you want to comment
on that, because for me, that's a beautiful idea of like letting ourself love and opening
us up to the other. Yeah, I think maybe something that you also are, you're also expressing in that
with that sentiment is the idea that the other is not just outside, that it's an inner,
inner other too, that you discover about yourself. That this logic of sameness, this imposition
that we do, we also impose it on ourselves. Like the idea of waking up and planning every
minute, since the moment you wake up until the moment optimizing everything. Optimization is
really based based on the assumption that I know myself. I know what I can do. And I know what I
want to do. But it's a it's a very dull life if I operate with the assumption that I know everything
that about myself, I know what I'm what I should do. So yeah, I agree that it's, you know, our
relationships that we find aspects of ourselves that we wouldn't, we wouldn't find. I long time
ago, I had a friend who is a very close friend. And in a moment in a sentimental moment, she told me
if I don't talk with you for too long, I will forget who I am. And it really made me think.
I feel I feel like that's a general statement that we could apply to all good friendships.
And if we don't get in touch with our good friends, we will really lose touch with ourselves.
Because they provide us with a place, a good friendship or good conversation provides,
provides us with a place to be, to dwell, to express who we are, and then we responded to.
And in that dialogue, we find something. And that part of that something is ourselves.
But it's not the narcissistic self. It's the, it's the other self, if you will.
And how have you found this? I was going to read out, it's a bit of a mouthful. So let me
in fact, the book ends the agony of heroes. And I'm so glad you brought up your friend,
because the part I'm going to read is about friendship. So the young Shalan ends the book
saying, the philosopher is a friend, a lover. Here, the lover is not an outward personality,
an empirical circumstance, but a presence that is intrinsic to thought, a condition of possibility
of thought itself, a living category, a transcendental lived reality. And this is perhaps my favorite
part because this idea of thinking, thinking in the strong sense begins with heroes.
To be able to think, one must first have been a friend, a lover. Without heroes,
thinking loses all vitality and turmoil and becomes repetitive and reactive.
Heroes infuses thinking with desire for the atopic other. So, you know, and this, your friend said
that she kind of forgets even who she is unless she's in dialogue with you. And I'd say I have a
lot of friends in my life where I do know if I don't talk to them, eventually I start forgetting
even who I am. I love that line. Thank you for reading that. To be able to think one must first
have been a friend, a lover. It's so true and it, you know, because people who have an interest in
philosophy and have been involved with philosophy for years, they might forget that, that it didn't
begin with an interest in a given book or a philosophical question. It began as maybe in a
context of a relationship with a teacher or with a friend, with a person who seemed very intriguing.
There was friendliness there at the bottom. And that's why a lot of times philosophical questions
begin with a line of thought with something like, what is love? What is true love? Or,
you know, in some movies, characters ask each other, can men and women really be just friends?
That's, you have a relationship with someone and within that, within the context of a
relationship, friendship, those questions are posed. But the engine of those questions is
their relationship. That's the idea. But it's so easy to forget that. And that itself is also
interesting that we forget. Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's beautiful. Well, I feel like we
did touch on the burnout society, but perhaps maybe let's try that because for me, what I was
thinking was, so for myself, I've been recommending Byung-Shul Han to many people and even sharing
your videos around, in fact. And one reason I do that is because I think people that aren't,
and I don't mean this in any way in like a supercilious condescending way, people that aren't,
let's say, as obsessed with reading the way you and I are. This is why I started the question
with how do you read philosophy because philosophers write in dense ways that are esoteric and
abstruse. It's really hard to get through to them. And for me, Byung-Shul Han is certainly an
exception because I find his work extremely accessible. Like he writes in very clear, concise
terms, plain language. And that's one reason I talk about him. But then the other reason is because
he theorizes. He's a living, breathing, critical theorist. We're not reading Heidegger from the
20th century or Adorno from the 20th century. We're reading a person that's in, for instance,
in Transparency Society. He talks about Facebook. He talks about social media. So I'm curious to
ask a rather, there's a bit of a banal question, but I think it's worth discussing. What are your
views on the world of social media? I mean, I'm going to stop calling it the online world because
I don't think it's the online world anymore. It is our world. It's our life world. Social media has
become, it's become the modern church, become the town square in some sense. So just through the
kind of Byung-Shul Han framework, let's say, or worldview, what are your views on the world of
social media? Yeah, great. The world of social media, these media platforms,
they are places for consumption. But they are also, at the same time, places for production.
The you and I, we both go there to produce. And they are not neutral. They put demands on us.
They put demands on us both when we are consuming and they put demands on us both,
also when we are putting a producer hat or a content creator uncomfortable with that phrase.
But we all, as somebody who posts, anybody who posts regularly on YouTube, you know that the
super ego of the YouTuber tells him or her or them that you should put something every week.
You should post something. You should have a posting schedule. Why? Because the platform demands you,
demands that from you. Algorithmic desire. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So social media, to me,
every time I feel like I am really using social media for myself or for genuine human
relationships, it always feels like I'm cheating it or I'm getting away using it in the way that
I'm not supposed to use. I have a couple of friends that I message back and forth on Twitter.
And Twitter with them is like a messaging system. It's private messaging. You know,
we have these long threads of talking about books that we are reading.
And Twitter or X is not supposed to be used that way. It has its own way of that it wants you to
use it. Ideally, you will use it in this way. So yeah, I think it's important to be, you're right.
Han is important to read because he's writing for our time. He's writing for us. He really is
writing about things that are aspects of our reality. And that includes the digital media,
social media, or you know, quote on quote social media, because they're not really social. I don't
always feel like I am connected when I'm there. So I decided I myself, I don't know what your
thoughts are on this, but I decided to limit, really limit. So I don't have Facebook anymore.
I don't have Instagram anymore. I just felt like I need one or two. So I kept YouTube and X
formerly known as Twitter. These two, I feel like, okay, two, I can deal with them. I can be
careful with them. But when it comes to like multiple, you're always catching up. I felt like
I was always catching up to them. And you have different people in your social circle. Everybody
is more on one platform. It's really strange. And you forget that, you know, these people are not
really in your life. Some of them, some of them are not really in your life. You like delete Facebook,
completely lose touch with some of them. And I did. And I was like, okay,
what does that mean? I don't know. Yeah, I like that you said social media is not social. I couldn't
agree more. In fact, it's a, for me, it should probably be called something like narcissistic
media or something, because it's, I've realized that this goes back to the idea of you, you
discussing sameness. In social media, it's the ultimate tool to make everything same. Because
everyone's just another follower, another comment, another listener. And then which is why, in fact,
I should have spoken about this earlier. I love that you do the reading groups, where it's a much
more smaller, close knit community. And you know the people that it's not a parasocial relationship.
That being said, David, I want to ask you this. I love asking this question from kind of people
who want to critical theory. So you probably noticed or observed a lot of technologists,
they, they think, okay, the solution is decentralization, crypto social media,
sorry, blockchain social media, or the solution is this new telegram or like, so
they always look for technological solutions, right, as in to the, to our perils of our contemporary
world. Now, personally, I don't think the solution is technological, even though it's
interesting, you said that you cut off certain platforms, you cut off Instagram and Facebook,
and you only use Twitter and or X and YouTube, perhaps in that case, yeah, so those, those
platforms suit more of what you want to do on social media. But at a broader level, I'm wondering,
do you think not that there are simple solutions to any of this, but at least to,
let's say, reduce human suffering? I mean, I think that's a good thing that people,
people have through social media, do you think that the solution is technological? Do you think
it's, it's something a lot more social and ideological or political even, or has there got
to be something which is kind of a dialectical between between the both, between both these,
let's say camps? I'm not sure. I think if you think of technology broadly,
beyond just digital technology, I think the answer has to be technological, and that just means
being mindful of how we use our infrastructure, the platforms that we have. And, you know,
I'm using technology in the sense that, you know, a chalkboard is a piece of technology too,
you know, or a matchbox is a, or glasses, you know, piece of technology. It, we,
any kind of a solution requires its own technology, and it's, it comes with its own
set of beliefs as well. So it's, I think they go hand in hand. The kind of world that is reflected
in the technologies that we embrace. But yeah, I'm not sure. I don't really spend much time
thinking about large scale solutions. I don't think my brain really has those,
those ambitions, unfortunately. The reason I asked was because I think my, in fact,
I still haven't got like a thesis topic, but something I would like to theorize on is for
my masters is like on the philosophy of technology and kind of see if I can do that.
And, and, you know, a person who perhaps the single handle of the essay that influenced me the
most is Heidegger's A Question Concerning Technology. And like the idea is that, you know,
this is now kind of like a point that I think everyone agrees on that technology
isn't itself a neutral thing. It has its own metaphysic. It's always tilted towards a certain
side. It cannot be neutral or objective. So when we introduce a technology that itself comes with
its baggage of let's say ideas and presupposition. So, and like, but then the question is,
does that mean, does that mean the, the, the, that technology, you know, the kind of the more
than the Marxist sense that our material conditions, the technology will change how people,
people's beliefs, or is it more that the technology is created out of more of like the
background beliefs people already have. So to use, again, the idea that the idea of
burnout society where everything becomes a project, you'd see people create like
myriad software tools to make you more productive tools, you know, different kinds of, so for me,
those, those technologies are kind of like symptoms of what our society has at the moment,
like our current, yeah, in some sense, I'd call it a sickness, you know. And so I don't know,
I'm just putting some ideas out here just to, you know, hear your thoughts, but I found them
quite interesting. An example that I sometimes think about is, you know, when I put first time,
I joined Twitter, I really became aware of how my mind slowly started to think in terms of tweets.
You know, this was years ago, this was, I think, 2014. That was a, before I first,
first deleted my Twitter account and joined again after some years. But this, this change happens,
this change of, you know, you're plugged into a, to a piece of technology, and it morphs,
it shapes the ways in which not necessarily the content, but it forms your thoughts,
say, okay, your thoughts appear to you, appear in your mind in the form of a tweet,
or you get an idea, and the idea is already pre-packaged. If you're a YouTuber,
your idea is already, it comes to you in the form of a, of a YouTube idea, idea for a YouTube video,
and you write it down. I'm sure that's how novelists or short story writers experience their
lives. They experience a moment where an idea comes to them and they write it down potentially,
because they are, they're, they're plugged into that practice of writing short stories or writing
novels. We are plugged into these technologies that we have relationships with, and they enable
certain forms of, forms of expressions and prohibits other forms of expressions that, you know,
they're, they're out now. And if you take it, if you take a radical view, the kinds of expressions
that we come capable, we, we are capable of because of these technologies are the kinds of
expressions that we are capable of thinking. The things that we cannot say anymore are the
things that we cannot think anymore. So the, the very structure, the very form of our beliefs are
limited and formed. In addition to that, there's this time bound and nature of the things that we
say, you know, something comes to my mind, I write a tweet about it, and I let go of it, it's gone.
I, my relationship to it becomes like, oh, look at me, I did that. How many likes did I receive?
Okay, 20 or 10 or two, you know, but it becomes like, it brings it into a particular logic of
sameness that all thoughts are equal, you know, the difference between them is based on this metric
of likes or views or whatever the metric is that the platform tells us.
You talked about that. You said these technologies might shape our beliefs.
But I think before that, that's, that's certainly true that they influence what we believe, but
they also influence how we believe. They influence how we relate to the things, how strictly, how
seriously we take them, or what else do we take seriously? Like, is that what you meant by the
form of belief? Yeah, yeah, the form. I see. The how, the how of our, you know, thoughts. Indeed,
indeed. In fact, you know, Simon Critchley, when I spoke to him, he made a really good point that,
yes, the internet social media has done, it's done wonders for philosophy, because now everyone's,
you know, having these kinds of conversations, people are listening to philosophers online. It's
like everyone's exposed to philosophy in some sense. It's just, it's so convenient, but it's
been terrible for the novel. It's been terrible for long form. You, you kind of, you sit in some corner,
no distractions, and you just read a book, you read, I don't know, James Joyce, so to, I'm not
that I've read James Joyce, but, you know, where you can, you can really spend days and even months,
you know, carefully gone through a book. And because of this idea that, as you said about that,
all, everything is the same. All ideas are the same. So no, no, no pinker, no novel, no work of art
deserves some kind of salience over every other book out there. You know, and I find that quite
interesting. So, and, and yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, because for me, I always thought that
it's, it's, it's a rather like simple thing to say that, oh, of course, technology affects us
and our thoughts. That's, that's fine. But my, something I really would like to explore more is
what, what creates technology? I mean, okay, a part of it is certainly this kind of creative
impulse that we all humans have this, this need to create. But the different kinds of technologies
we do create in our society, what's the, what are the, what's, what are the ideological
preset positions we create them off? You know, be the productivity app and my background's in
computer science. I'm a software engineer. So I think a lot about software, you know, be the
productivity app or some kind of like sales app. So what are the preset positions we have when we
have the motivations to create a technology? And that's the part that interests me.
And is that motivation, is, is that motivation something that we get from the market?
Yeah, I mean, that's, that's a good question. Cause like, okay, a very, I think I'm playing
with it, put it as, yes, for money. I want to, you know, I want to make, I want to have like a
startup and make a lot of money. But I don't know, I don't think it's that simple. I think
that's a bit of a, because there are many ways to make money. I mean, you could,
I don't know, you could become a real estate agent and make a lot of money.
But I find that, especially in like tech world, the more of like the
hipster creative types, they have this, you know, they have this very like, even like a
messiah complex, I want to save the world. I want to create this amazing software that
that revolutionizes lives. And so my question is where do those beliefs come from?
Right. But the very, the very statement that this is going to make money, that itself, tacitly,
it is expressing a set of beliefs about the market that a certain type of app will sell because
because there's a demand for it, because there's a market for it, because certain types of things
are in demand, because we live in a culture where productivity is, is in value and people
are struggling with it. So a productivity app is going to be great. And so those, those kinds of
nice. Like if you want to make money, you want to create something that, that falls
within the logic of the market. And then that, that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Excellent. And
said, I mean, oh, wow, it's funny. I lost track of time. It's almost, we, we got about 10,
15 minutes remaining. I was going to say, I wasn't very efficient. Oh, my God, this is
been an enjoyable path. And this is an absolute pleasure. I mean, look, I really hope we can
have a lot more conversations and like keep on, keep this dialogue going. But it's funny. I was
going to say, in the interest of time, and then I realized that the utter capacity of that, that
we're talking about slowness and taking time. But, but just for the listeners, because really,
you know, my, my, one of my goals with this conversation, again, see, I'm goal oriented,
was to kind of propagandize for Byung-Shul Han. It really was that I really wanted more people
to read him. Because I think, I think that's great value in reading his work. Just, just,
yeah, just for the listeners to kind of put in like a very simplistic way, let's say, or like
in a nutshell, to use the term I hate. What, what do you think of Byung-Shul Han's perhaps his most
valuable insights and his most pertinent insights to our time and that perhaps can be a reason to
read him? I would say, I would emphasize for people who are new to Han, I would, you know,
my kind of invitation would be, he is really great at connecting our very personal experiences,
like the experience of being tired, the experience of not having enough mental energy to do all the
tasks that you're supposed to do. Our experiences of loneliness, being tired and alone, you know,
at the end of the day. And all these experiences, he pays attention to them and he connects them to
broader patterns, broader trends in culture, in society, in technology. And that is really valuable,
I think. He keeps, he doesn't keep the discussion of private experiences at that level, at that
scope, at that original scope of interest. Yes, of course, we're interested in it, but
he helps us make sense of it by putting it in a larger context and different contexts. And
with the help of different thinkers, he introduces us to a host of other valuable thinkers like Foucault,
Plato, Nietzsche, Arendt, Hannah Arendt, and he's very good at connecting the
moments in our thought, in a discussion, with the right moments, the right person,
and bringing a passage, a quotation. He really has an, he's very artful in the use of quotations,
in the use of references. So that style, that general style, I think, is a great contribution.
He also highlights these structures that we are participating in, and becoming aware of these
structures, I think is very helpful. We won't forget those structures that he's talking about.
And then, like any good thinker, he also has his maybe points where we can critically engage with
him and respond to him, but that's part of the journey. Indeed. I don't know if I
responded to your question. No, you absolutely did. In fact, just on that note, even
in a couple of your book reviews, you are critical. You do say, yeah, that this is probably not my
favorite book of Hans. Yeah, I think that's, you hit the nail on the head, David, because for me,
I think people who read a lot of self-help books, they would really benefit from reading
Banshal Hans, because what he makes, he makes the private social, he shows how the private
is political, that what we think are these private struggles, they are social struggles,
that they're a result of the society we live in. So I think that's a beautiful place to conclude.
And at the moments where he says, okay, if you just, you might think that if you just push hard
enough, you will get to the bright side, you will solve it, if you just optimize yourself enough.
But that's part of it. But that's not the solution. That's part of the structure of the problem.
The solution itself is part of the problem. Yeah. That's right. That's right. The promise of the
solution is a false promise. Thank you, David. I hope this is the first of many more conversations
to come between us. I hope so too. Thank you. I hope so too. Thank you so much, Rahul.
