I completely got your critiques of predictive processing, which I concur with. But what are
your views on something like the free energy principle by Carl Friston, who, after all,
is a neuroscientist. Would you say it's a good model of framework to work with? Or do you think
it is? No, I think it's a bogus analogy. So it's obviously an analogy because the term comes from
physics. In free energy, there's a perfectly well understood idea where energy is the capacity to
work, and free energy is the energy that's available in the current context to do work. Great idea,
really important. So what's the free energy principle? Well, people who are big fans of
predictive processing have worked their butts off to try to figure out what it is. And Friston's
a horrible writer. He writes with incredible obscurity. He writes like a postmodernist,
actually, a postmodernist mathematician. And that's not what mathematics is supposed to be like.
Mathematics is incredibly powerful because it's clear and you can see what's going on. But his
math is unclear and the free energy principle is what I call a bogus analogy. The term comes from
my book, Balance. I wrote a book on balance a couple of years ago. And it talks both about the
neuroscience of balance, but also talks about the way balance has become a metaphor that pervades
human thought. But different metaphors have different values. Metaphors aren't all good. Some
of them are really evil. They can be used to defend slavery, for example. So your question is,
what kind of metaphor have we got here? Is it one that's good or unclear or utterly bogus? Well,
here, I think it's bogus because he's trying to carry over from physics some sense of profundity
from free energy. But if you look what he means by that, as much or far as anyone's been able to
figure it out, and people like Anil Seth have tried to figure out what he meant by it, you say,
well, it's just another way of saying predictive processing. So I'm trying to say that what the
brain is doing is to make predictions about the future in order to figure out what's likely to
happen and satisfy its goals. So that's not a reasonable idea. It's a real hypothesis. And
I think it's one of the six things that brains do. But to elevate that into a free energy principle,
using a bogus physical expression for physics, as I think is frankly, illegitimate. It's just not
a good use of metaphor. It's not a good use of analogy. It's a highly misleading term that is
pseudo profundity. It's kind of like, actually, among the post-modernists you mentioned, I don't
think Foucault is bogus. I think he's actually got a lot of insights into the way society works.
But a lot of the other people in that category, Derrida and often Cizek, they really just don't
understand the difference between obscurity and profundity. So that is, you should be able to
figure out, what are they saying? Is it true or is it false? And you can do that often with Foucault.
You can do that with good cognitive scientists. But the idea of free energy is just so kind of
obscure that it's hard to make sense of it. And I think actually the predictive processing idea
is clear enough that you can see that it's not true, because as I said, the mind does a lot of
other things besides prediction, and it does it by means other than Bayesian processing. So predictive
processing is an idea that's interesting but wrong, whereas free energy is an idea that's just too
obscure to be even wrong. I see, because as a layperson, my confusion always with the free energy
principle was, I saw what Professor Friston was getting. And in fact, I'm calmly reading his book
Active Inference. But as a meta-theory, as like a theory of mind that encompasses what the mind is,
I always felt it lacked certain other parts of what the mind does, like for instance, coherence,
explanatory coherence. And emotion for evaluation. Yes. And appraisal and communication with others.
You need all of these things if you're going to have a full theory of mind. It's really just got one
tiny corner. It commits something that I've called Thaley's disease. Thaley's was really the first
philosopher and the first scientist. Absolutely brilliant thinker. But he came up with a theory
that was just a little too simple. His theory is everything is water. Well, that was brilliant.
It's absolutely simple. But even by Aristotelian standards, whether you also need earth, air,
and fire, it just didn't cut it. And of course, now that we know there's 118 different elements,
no, it doesn't work. So what I call Thaley's disease is coming up with a theory that looks
brilliantly simple, but it's just way too simple. And that's definitely true of predictive processing
as well.
