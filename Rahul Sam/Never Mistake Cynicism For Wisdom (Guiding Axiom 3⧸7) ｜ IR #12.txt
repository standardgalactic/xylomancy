Hey everyone, welcome to yet another episode of the NRLN podcast.
I shall continue what I've been doing in the previous episodes where I read out
these guiding axioms that I laid down for my newsletter, The Unhappy Man,
and in case you didn't watch the previous episodes to repeat the same old introduction,
sort of ad nauseam, I laid down seven axioms for my writing for the newsletter and in the
middle of it I realized, oh wow, what I'm writing here, it's not just for the newsletter, in fact,
it's sort of a framework for all of my creative work and this podcast certainly is a part of
what I consider to be my creative work, so it just makes sense to read out these axioms so that,
you know, since the podcast just started and if you're a new variable listener, whatever you may be,
you'll see where I'm coming at when I'm trying to produce content for the podcast,
not just my monologues or my pieces, even the interviews I hope to
do through the axioms that I've been laying down and today's axiom is axiom number three,
if you did miss the other two, please go and watch them, it's part of the playlist,
it's all on the YouTube channel on Spotify, but without further ado, let's get started.
The guiding axiom number three for The Unhappy Man, for the Interrelant podcast, for all of my
creative work is, and this is very, very important, I wrote this with a lot of passion, I would say,
it's something that's very, very close to my heart, never mistake cynicism for wisdom.
In Dostoevsky's Kraman punishment, Raskolnikov has a point when he says,
pain and suffering are always inevitable, for a large intelligence and a deep heart,
the really great men must, I think, have a great sadness on earth.
Perhaps it's true that men of higher intellectual acuity are more aware of the world's tragedy
and folly, so their contempt for the deluded masses who are lost in superficial vanity
and worldly self-indulgence probably has some warrant, but I wonder if those Nietzschean critiques
with their eruditeness and polemical virtuosity tend to fall in love with their own ingenious,
in truth the highbrows rarely believe about themselves what Socrates declared of himself.
I neither know nor think, I know. Most casual critical philosophizing is merely one's cynicism
being projected onto the world masquerading as wisdom. The only thing worse than a cynic is an
accompanying sharp intellect to tantalize a cynicism. For instance, if we take happiness,
something elusive for us humans, such a person refuses to believe that someone could be genuinely
happy in this world, and is dismissive or even hates anyone trying to do so. Let's see a man
who's sincerely endeavoring to make something of himself as merely a show one puts on to please
the cultural overlords, pusillanimously and slavishly living by an emasculating moral duty.
For the cynic, the ordinary person, playing his part as a steadfast citizen, fulfilling
his responsibilities towards his family, paying his dues to the divine without overtly theologizing
God, and maybe even volunteering at a homeless shelter once in a while, is all but puppetry.
The cynic sneers at all of this effort and says it's all futile and only for the credulous. They
are in utter disbelief of sincerity and anyone striving towards the good. In their enlightenment
state, they think of themselves as being beyond the trivialities of ordinary life and basic morality,
despite being willing to even suffer for their cynical ideologies. But the irony is that a cynic
is critical of everything and anything but their hubristic cynicism. The cynical attitude of the
heart always comes first and the rationalization second. Whenever I encounter a cynic, which
sometimes is someone I meet within my own soul, I'm reminded of what G.K. Chesterton wrote about
the new rebel in orthodoxy. But the new rebel is a skeptic and will not entirely trust anything.
He has no loyalty, therefore he can never be really a revolutionist.
And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything.
For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind, and the modern revolutionist
doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it.
Thus, he writes one book, complaining that imperial oppression insults the purity of women,
and then he writes another book about the sex problem in which he insults it himself.
He curses the sultan because Christian girls lose their virginity and then curses
Mrs. Grandi because they kept it. As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life,
and then as a philosopher, that all of life is a waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce
a policeman for killing a peasant and then proved by the highest philosophical principles
that the peasant ought to have killed himself. A man denounces marriage as a lie,
and then denounces aristocratic profligates for treating it as a lie. He calls a flag a
bobble, and then blames the oppressors of Poland or Ireland because they take away that bobble.
The man of this school goes first to a political meeting where he complains that savages are treated
as if they were beasts, then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting
where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist
being an infinite skeptic is always engaged in undermining his own minds.
In his book on politics, he attacks men for trampling on morality. In his book on ethics,
he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore, the modern man in revolt has practically
become useless for all purposes of revolt. A rebelling against everything, he has lost the
right to rebel against anything. So before I do read out my commentary on that paragraph,
the good thing about doing a podcast is I can sort of impromptuly add
notes and ancillary points to reading the essay. So think of this as more of a footnote. A lot of
people think of Chesterton as being a typical orthodox, conservative kind of thinker, anthillogen,
but I wouldn't necessarily simplify him to that level. I think he's a much deeper,
profound thinker than merely someone defending the orthodoxy. So in that spirit,
I read him and in that spirit, I wrote this little bit as a commentary on what I just read.
To explicate his sentiments, Chesterton writes not of his averseness or disdain of the
of the revolutionary, but of the rebel who's a cynic, where his ideological affiliations merely
a projection of an essential spiritual attitude. And the problem with the cynicism is that it
becomes a lazy way to opt out of life. Echoing a more contemporary religious thinker, Jordan
Pearson's sentiments, we're met with an ultimate outlook on life. Either everything wonders matters,
which comes with the concomitant and crushing burden of responsibility. The striving man chooses
his path and recognizes that his striving, no matter how arduous and demanding, is meaningful
and necessary. Or the other is nothing matters, therefore one refuses to partake in life.
This man is super-seriously contemptuous of the striving man and his so-called higher virtues,
which is too simple and naive. It's only a matter of time when such a person's cynicism
becomes resentment and they've created hell for themselves. He'd say better to be a king in hell
than a slave in heaven. Funnily enough, I've begun to notice the latter type in the more cerebral
intellectual types. But that's a whole other conversation. In any case, existential apathy
and resignation cannot be a mere negation because being, which we all in escapably are,
requires the void to be filled with something meaningful.
Free will itself is mostly a curse, as one does not look into the niche in abyss.
But the infinite boundlessness of one's possibilities, which Kierkegaard called
the dizziness of freedom that everyone confronts in life when we are met with freedom's
actuality as the possibility of possibility. This is why the philosophers try to convince
themselves that men are not free. Most of us are petrified of truly being free.
Having said that, I'm not as optimistic as Peterson or any other run-of-the-mill conservative.
Unequivocally adopting responsibility, much like the striving man Ipsofacto, cannot be the antidote
to rescue one from the gazing abyss or the dizziness imbued by the endless possibility of
possibility. I could see how most of us modern humans could be a Joseph K. or a Gregor Samsa
stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare, lost in triviality and vanity, doing meaningless alienating work.
Knowing very well our life entails nothingness, but refusing to unshackle ourselves from the
ideological chains as freedom hurts. Kafka himself wrote, I'm in chains, don't touch my chains.
Yet that paragraph clearly is my Marxist side. I think the conservatives are way too optimistic
and to some sense even naive about this question of meaning. In any case, the final paragraph,
ergo in typical absurdist fashion. I go even a step further from my previous claim of humans being
lousy at being happy to conclude that we're equally or even lousier at finding meaning
despite being the only beings in the universe that yearns for it desperately. The predominant
ideologies and modes of being prescribed to us by the wisest of men, stoicism, revolt or rebellion,
adopting responsibility, piety, cosmic resignation, Salatrian, radical freedom, the post-modern
notion of existence, perceived essence, etc. are inadequate for the human heart.
While there are pronounced ways to be unhappy, miserable,
loveless and meaningless in life, there's no ideal predestined way to be happy, content and living
meaningfully. In that case, I have no choice but to be wholeheartedly happy for the happiness of
another, even though it may seem ludicrous to me. I ought to never assume someone's happiness is a
sign of inauthenticity or God forbid naivety. And indeed, this means never to mistake my
cynicism for wisdom. And in this podcast, I shall always strive to never, ever make that mistake.
Thanks for watching. Cheers.
