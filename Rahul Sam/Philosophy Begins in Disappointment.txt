Simon, you claim that philosophy does not begin in an experience of wonder as ancient tradition
contends, but rather, I think, with the indeterminate but palpable sense that something desired has not
been fulfilled, that a fantastic effort has failed. Philosophy begins in disappointment.
It's one of your famous lines, I think. And so, firstly, would you want to comment on this exhibit
but also, perhaps, elucidate on what you mean by philosophy begins in disappointment?
Well, is the world wonderful or is the world disappointing? More the latter, isn't it?
Right. So, and if philosophy is, you know, if philosophy is thinking, is its time,
is its time in thought, then we have to begin from disappointment. It seems to me, you know.
So, it's a good way of making a contrast with a view which is just a popular view,
the idea of wonder, because it sounds cool. But if you look at the sources for it, it's a view
that Aristotle ascribes to those people that came way before him, the physiologi, philosophers of
nature. He thought they experienced wonder in relationship to nature, but hadn't.
Aristotle doesn't claim that he experienced his wonder. So, it's a view that was already
out of fashion by the time of the 5th century BC. And so, the idea there is that the modern world is
most certainly an experience of disappointment, and that's where you have to begin. It's not
where you end. So, people often get, you know, are you the disappointment guy? So, no, philosophy
begins in disappointment. It doesn't end in disappointment. Well, that's where it begins.
So, I think it's, I mean, I don't say as much these days as I used to, but I still think it's right,
you know. Indeed, indeed. Yeah. Do you think that there's a very, like,
apocal way of thinking, I guess, but that in terms of times when philosophy becomes most pertinent,
for instance, Jacques, who you've written polemics with, he claims that, oh, now we live in this
time where these grand metaphysical questions are coming back into our culture,
kind of like the time that, let's say, the German idealist went through,
or do you think that there are these periods in human history where philosophy becomes
most pertinent, or that it's more a historical or a contextual as to
how philosophical development or progress, if you could call that, takes place?
Good question, very difficult question to answer. It's hard to find progress in philosophy, you know.
The questions that we're asking are the same questions that the
Plato and Aristotle asked, so we don't have answers for them, so you might want to say philosophy is
a series of perennial questions without answers, and that's a good way of thinking about it.
Philosophy is a movement into perplexity about basic issues, and sophistry or ideology
always claims to have an answer. This is what this means, this and so on and so forth, so
if you claim to know, then you're selling something, you're selling snake oil or whatever it might be.
So one way of looking at it is that philosophy really exhibits their progress over thousands of
years, and then it's also where do you even say it begins? Does it begin with the Greeks?
I think you lost you there for a bit, Sam. Yeah, I think that was at my end,
that there's something that happens in this building I'm in, that only happens
during business hours, but normally by this time it's pretty, so anyway, but I've got another
another Wi-Fi. Oh, great, that's all fine. After doing podcasts for almost two years
with people all over the world, I'm kind of used to this now, so it's totally fine.
So we might get another breakage like that. Anyway, I was saying, so philosophy exhibits no
progress on fundamental issues, we could say, and then it's a question of opinion really, I mean it's
anybody that claims to have
you know, some special insight into this is lying. There does seem to be a connection between,
I mean, philosophy seems to be particularly creative at certain critical points in history,
so we can think about, you know, the 13th century and the rise of scholasticism and that,
which comes out of that confluence of thinking in the Arabic world, Greek thinking in the Arabic
world and then that finding its feet in Paris and Bologna and the beginnings of universities and
that, or you could say the 17th century, the rise of the scientific view of things, which is also a
period of intense conflicts, war, and we could, if we look at the 20th century,
there's no doubt that, I mean, the first and second world wars were not great,
but they did provide stimulus for philosophical thinking, and which itself is quite interesting,
first world war, you get Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, Lukacs, Heidegger for sure, and the second world
war really produces generations of philosophers that are really, you know, doing high-level
interesting work. Where are we now? I don't know. I think there's a renewed interest in philosophy,
and, you know, I've been trying to help that along in my little way over the years, but it's,
and in many ways, in a way, the internet has been kind to philosophy in the way that it's been
unkind to the novel, which was the, you know, that was the cultural form that dominated the
world that I grew up in, people read novels, now they watch Netflix series, and maybe they've got
some space for short-form, you know, short-form blogs and articles and things like that, ideas
which are more easily digested, so perhaps it's a good time for philosophy, but it's not a good
time institutionally, and philosophy is, you know, there are different views of philosophy,
one view is that, you know, philosophy is just thinking, and it can take place anywhere,
and philosophy should be in the streets, and that's fine, and that goes all the way back to the
cynics and, you know, thinking in public in ancient Greece, often without clothes on,
masturbating and living in barrels and doing crazy things. Another view is that philosophy is
something which has always required an institutional framework, and that's, you know, that's what the
academy was for Plato, the Lyceum for Aristotle, and so on and so forth, so the institutional
framework for the last couple of hundred years has been the university, and is interesting
philosophy coming out of universities at this point, I don't think so, I really don't, there's a lot
of smart people, but not really much happening, so that would be one kind of half-answer to that
difficult question.
