I want to discuss explanatory coherence. You've done a lot of work on that and I'm wondering if
you could kind of give a brief introduction to what explanatory coherence is to a lay audience,
what at the same time why you think it's what are the what are the implications
in fields such as AI and psychology? That's a big question but it's a really interesting one.
So let's go back to Darwin. So I've mentioned one of my favorite books of all time is the
Origin of Species. So what was he doing in that? Well in my view what he was trying to do was to
give a coherent explanation of all sorts of things that he observed. So he went on this
voyage around the world and he collected all sorts of other kinds of biological information
and he gradually seemed to him that it seemed in fact that the species had evolved. I mean now
everybody knows that kids get that probably in grade four but it was a very controversial idea.
Some people had maintained it but it went up against religious doctrines
and so he gradually started to amass more and more evidence that species had evolved.
But then from reading a crazy economist named Malthus he suddenly got the idea of how they
evolved and that's how he came up with the idea of the natural selection. So now he had not only
a bunch of observations and the idea that evolution probably had occurred that would explain it but
an idea of how how evolution had occurred that is that natural selection was the mechanism behind
evolution. So what he did in that book was an incredibly beautiful argument for his view as
opposed to the view that was dominant at the time which was divine creation. So what he was trying
to show is that his view was a better explanation but then divine creation because it was more
coherent with the evidence. So this is an account that philosophers call inference to the best
explanation. You can argue that something's the best explanation because it's more coherent with
the evidence but now you have to say what coherence is. So I had these early ideas coming out of my
philosophy of science background but then in 1987 I got one of the best ideas I've ever had which was
how to turn coherence from a sort of vague philosophical idea into a precise computational
one that is how can you compute coherence. So I've been working on neural networks in collaboration
with my colleague Keith Holyoke and he came up with an idea that you could use neural networks to
explain analogy. These neural networks of course are now absolutely central to artificial intelligence
it's really taken off that's a whole fascinating topic in itself. But he figured out a way of
doing that and by that time I'd done my master's in computer science so I was a pretty good programmer
and so I programmed up a program to use neural networks to do analogies. So that that was nice
and then I thought what else could apply to and then I thought back to the problem that was part of
my doctoral dissertation which was inference to the best explanation. How do you pick up the best
theory and so then I realized that that kind of coherence can be understood using the same kind
of neural network technique that Keith and I had done for for analogy. So it was a really powerful
method both computationally but also psychologically because there have now since then been lots of
psychological experiments that back up this idea of coherence. So I think of the mind the brain is
essentially a coherence agent. There's some people who think that it's primarily a predictive engine
but I don't think that's true. I think it's primarily a coherence engine. We're trying
to make sense of things whether we're making sense of the past which is what explanations do
or making sense of the future. We're making coherent predictions or we're trying to identify
things. Is that a rabbit or a squirrel? Those are our different kinds. So everything we do can be
understood as having coherence behind it. But coherence now isn't just a sort of vague metaphor
that was for philosophers. It's not just a matter of consistency. It's rather of
taking a whole bunch of different things and putting them into a good package.
But what's a good package? Well here there's an idea that came out of the neural network world
called constraint satisfaction. So we're trying to satisfy a bunch of constraints. What constraints
did Darwin face while he was trying to explain as much as possible about what he'd seen in the
biological world? That's the positive constraints. But he also had a negative constraint and said he
had to show that he could do that better than the theory that was the competitor at the time
which is divine creation. So that's a negative constraint. So what you're doing in all of these
things whether it's decision making or pattern recognition or even emotion, you're putting
together different sorts of constraints to evaluate what's the most coherent view. So that's how I
came to see coherence not just as a vague philosophical idea but as a quite precise
computational one that can be used to explain the mechanisms that underlie a vast amount of human
thinking. So that's why I think coherence is really a fundamental idea to psychology and
cognitive science and to these philosophical projects as well.
