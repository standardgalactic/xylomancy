So, Professor Scriven, if you could start with Popper and then of course the
unfortifiability principle. Now anyone could, I don't think it's that hard even for a layperson
like myself to just Google what it means and get a very elementary understanding.
So perhaps you could firstly just explain what the Kyle Popper, Popperian
unfortifiability principle is, but then also, as you've done in the book, rather well,
maybe lay down some of your criticisms, criticisms of it, just for the audience.
Yeah, sure. So Popper thought that really the heart of the scientific method was this very
simple idea that if a theory makes a false prediction, it has to be wrong somehow.
And Popper thought that at the core of the scientific inquiry was the systematic elimination
of all of the false theories. And notionally, of course, you could imagine one day having
eliminated them all and just having one true theory remaining, although as Popper was
understood as well as anyone, that was not a realistic prospect. But he thought we could
at least think of ourselves as making progress by eliminating the false theories.
So the thing that makes that... Oh, go ahead.
No, I was just going to ask, please continue. I'm not going to follow up on that, but keep going.
Yeah. Okay. So the thing that makes that though now turning to where he begins to run into difficulties
and he had plenty of things to say about these difficulties. It's not as if this is some sort
of one shot undermining in his view, but it's really difficult when a theory does make a
false prediction to figure out whether it was really the theory's fault or not.
Science is such a complicated thing. And in particular, the kinds of measurement apparatus
that are used to make observations and cutting edge science are often very complicated, fragile
things that only work when conditions are exactly right. 99.9% of the time, when you get a false
prediction, it's not really the theory's fault at all. It's just that something went wrong with
the apparatus. Or maybe you made a false assumption when you were making your calculations. Or maybe
even in this, this does happen. There's an error in the software that you're using to analyze your
results. And so it's not really the theory's fault or not. And it would be a terrible mistake to
throw away the theory just because you got this false prediction. So if you're going to do capture
the spirit of papa's proposal, you have to figure out some way of deciding when it's okay
to just say, oh, something went wrong with the apparatus. And when you should say,
Arno, this time, it's the theory's fault. And so we've falsified the theory, as he says, we can
throw away the theory. Sometimes, of course, you can just see that something went wrong with the
apparatus. Like, you know, it's smoking, making, but often, in many cases in the history of science,
we have results that were anomalous and looked like they cross problems with theories and we
will never know what went wrong, because it's just too late to go back and check.
I'm sure we'll probably end up talking about some examples later on, but
but this papa really never fully satisfactorily answered this question of when it's okay to blame
the apparatus or other assumptions and when you should blame the theory. I think he had, you know,
he had interesting substantive things to say, but he didn't succeed in writing down
what he was really after, which was a kind of a systematic calculus, if you like,
for making these decisions, something that took these decisions out of the hands of
scientists who might be indulging in motivated reasoning, you know, trying to
see their own theory in a good light and just sort of said, no, you must follow this logic.
And this logic says your theory is wrong. Yeah, because I haven't read his book where he introduced
a principle, what's it called, the logic of science, I believe, but that's it. Yeah,
I haven't read that book, although my understanding, again, at a very elementary level is that
it seems that papa really wanted some kind of a priori principle or even theory of science that
allows scientists to do science. And then what you would argue for and many others would be that,
oh, well, unfortunately, for better or worse, let's say we haven't found that.
Yeah. And so what you in fact have is, you know, I kind of made it all sound like more like a
philosophical argument, but the fact of science is you have real arguments over these things should
whether when to whether whether probably the result is just an artifact of some problem with
measuring apparatus or the theory really is in trouble. In fact, that's almost more normal than
any other state of affairs. So some typically scientists who performed in perform the experiment
will trust the apparatus more than the scientists sort of a few labs over who who weren't there to
kind of see it all operating and so on. And you know, in the end, when scientists keep going for
long enough, there does seem to be a kind of a consensus that consensus that forms the experiments
get done enough times been after different people. It's not as if it's we're just totally at sea,
but it doesn't have this simple crisp objective algorithmic field to it that Papa was really
reaching for. Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess that leads us to, I don't know if I should call it the
antithesis, but at least let's say we'll juxtapose Thomas Kuhn's theory that the paradigm shift,
the term that he popularized with with the Popperian principle. Yeah, so the structures
of scientific revolution, perhaps my my favorite book on philosophy of science, yours is a healthy
contender. And so in contrast to car popper, Professor Ravens, what's how does Thomas Kuhn
differ? Because he came after Popper, isn't that right? And, and what, what were his rights? Yeah.
So Papa was Papa wrote his book in the 1930s and Kuhn wrote his book in the 1960s to give you
some sense. So Papa is in a way essentially into war, I suppose we would now say and Kuhn is very
much post war job. And Papa was still kind of firing on all cylinders by then, but he wasn't
presenting whole new ideas. Well, he was entitled to kind of have a break. So Kuhn's idea is actually
it doesn't dispense with the idea of a scientific method, as I was saying earlier, but rather the
idea is that at any particular time period, a science, say like particle physics, or molecular
genetics, or economics, maybe micro economics will have a particular method, a particular set
of rules for doing science and actually a rather comprehensive set of rules for doing science.
But that these, these methods are not fixed for all time. In fact, they change in episodes from
time to time and in dramatic episodes called scientific revolutions, or the phrase that Kuhn
famously popularized for this is a paradigm shift. And the thing, the paradigm here is this kind of
big method for doing science. And when that when it shifts, that means the old paradigm has crumbled
and a new one comes along and replaces it. So whereas Papa and sort of classic, the classic
searches for a scientific method, we're looking for a single rule that is valid for all time,
as you said, hopefully our priority, one that we can just know is right without with certainty.
Kuhn thought these these methods only last for a while and then their scientists actually push
them to the point where they're all of their flaws are exposed because they're actually,
they're very rich, but they're also kind of limited, they have a lot of assumptions built in
and inevitably some of those assumptions will turn out to be wrong. And so scientists push them
to their breaking point. And in effect, they, they destroy their own methods by by exposing
the faulty assumptions or whatever. And then some new method has to come along and supplant the old
method a new paradigm comes along and supplants the old paradigm. That's a paradigm shift. That's
a scientific revolution. Then you have a whole new methodological complex governing what scientists
do in, in whatever area of science it is.
