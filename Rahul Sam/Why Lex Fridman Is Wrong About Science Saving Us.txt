There probably isn't anyone right now who's doing a better job than Lex Friedman at showing
the beauty of science and scientific discourse.
Because of Lex, ordinary people like me have the opportunity to listen to the most brilliant
months in the world as if we are just nonchalantly chatting over a beer.
And I'm sure there's an innumerable number of people who have turned on to programming,
AI, and science in general because of the Lex Friedman podcast.
With his tarryard curiosity, Lex, resembling Dostoevsky's idiot, not only makes science
accessible for neophytes like myself, but also shows his viewers the absolute necessity
and pertinence of science in our own lives.
So of course he's right in venerating the scientific enterprise, but science too has
its shortcomings like every man made philosophical enterprise.
And that's why I think Lex Friedman is wrong in believing science will save us.
Now when I do make a video where I'm disagreeing with one of my heroes, a person who's had an
unbelievable influence in my life that I can't just even put in words, I probably need to
make this caveat or have this caveat where I try to convey what the purpose and intent
behind this video is.
This isn't a gotcha or a Ben Shapiro debunk slash destroy this kind of video like those
early 2010, edgy, atheist, anti-SJW stuff that used to be on YouTube, not because I'm
above them or I'm saying that, you know, I find them below me.
I actually find them quite entertaining, but they were just that.
All I found them were pretty much entertainment, but I don't think any of those really edgy
kind of videos changed my mind.
So I don't want this video to be that because I just find them unproductive.
Rather, I want to try and delineate and expound on what I think are philosophical differences
between Lex and myself in the hopes of finding some kind of synthesis to its trip.
My disagreement is that when Lex considers our reality and the human experience, he makes
generalizing statements about science like this.
I wonder if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope that
science will save us as opposed to science will divide us.
Or when he says science wins through love and humility.
For example, this was from Lex Friedman podcast 238 with Francis Collins, where they discussed
the evasive pandemic and our reaction to it.
In the battle of ideas, I think humility and love wins.
That's how science wins, not through having quote unquote truth.
Now to be fair, though, when Lex uses the term science colloquially, I don't mean he
means it in the academic or scholarly way, the word science would be used, which involves
you know, empiricism and the systematic categorization or organization of knowledge.
Since he is a romantic like myself, I think he talks about the beauty of the scientific
enterprise of what it is for a conscious entity like a human being to do science, which is
in reality more different from what science means technically.
Regardless of the semantics, I think because of science's almost miraculous rise to influence
and it's become so ubiquitous and it's a part of our day to day life, our society, we've
unfortunately begun to replace the whole of the human experience with just science.
And I think the problem with that is that in some sense, when we replace the whole by
a singular, so the whole of the human experience by a singular aspect or a fragment of the
human experience like the scientific enterprise, it begins to lack any balance, let's say.
Because in the real world, as I kind of touched on, the scientific enterprise itself is nested
within the broader human experience.
And I think we make this mistake or we confuse these two things at our own peril as we evidently
see in the unraveling times we live in.
So if I could consider Lex's podcast itself, I'm glad he changed the name from artificial
intelligence to the Lex Friedman podcast.
artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary academic and scientific discipline.
The Lex Friedman podcast is a phenomenon that an observer experiences in different things.
And I'd even postulate that people are not necessarily attracted to AI, but rather to
the Lex Friedman podcast, where the discussion of AI, another sub experience, so to speak,
is only a part of the broader podcast experience.
My point being, there is something to our experience, let's make it a bit more tangible
and say the experience of learning that transcends mere scientific empiricism and materialism.
So I've made all these claims, but I really haven't backed any of it up.
And that's what I hope to do in the rest of the video.
But before I do do that, I kind of want to try and once again, succinctly lay down my
points using a bit of brevity, something that I'm terrible at because I'm quite verbose.
Anyways, here's my point.
My assertions are the scientific enterprise doesn't encompass all of the human experience.
Rather, science is nested within something transcendental.
Therefore, it's wrong to unequivocally assume that science will save us or be the ultimate
panacea to our predicaments.
Science is merely a tool to be exploited to use a somewhat dramatic term by our values,
which lies in a different domain, possibly the religious.
So to try and elucidate my points, I'll break down the rest of this video into two parts.
Firstly, the fact value distinction.
I'll discuss the axiomatic presuppositions we used to think and act in this world.
I'll try and understand the qualitative distinction between values and how facts are always,
bar none, filtered through our bellies, more specifically, moral bellies.
And then I'll use Jonathan Pedro's ideas of the hierarchy of bellies to show how science
is nested within religion.
Secondly, I'll discuss the dangers of scientific utopianism, the totalitarian impulse of reason
by coupling my concerns of scientism with the ideas from Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations
theory.
And then of course, we're looking to Alexis' favorite novelist, Fyodor Dostoevsky's critique
of utopian thinking with his use of the crystal palace in his literature.
You know, it's very common in the media where there's some political pundit or commentator
that say with rather overweening confidence, follow the science.
They declare that we ought to follow the science.
But the problem is, none of us can truly follow the science the way they mean it.
Because when someone makes a statement, they make this presupposition that we know where
to begin with.
They make the presupposition that we've got axioms to start this journey of following
the science with.
I mean, to put it plainly, when someone says follow something, that assumes there's a beginning
point or a start and an end.
Like for example, a topic that comes to my mind is something that's, of course, innocuous
and not controversial at all, like COVID and vaccines.
You know, from both sides in this whole debate, people say follow the science.
And you know, there are some people who are pro-vax, some people are anti-vax, some people
are pro-lockdowns, anti-lockdowns, or there are people like me who are, you know, lockdowns
to a certain extent, and then afterwards open up society, people should get vaccinated and
then, you know, move on with your lives, but don't cause or mandate the vaccines.
Sorry, I had to say all of that just to clarify my stance.
But the point being, you see, all these people in some sense, we are all given the same data.
We are at least exposed to similar variables, let's say.
However, the debate about COVID isn't scientific anymore.
It's completely value-based.
It's completely on what that starting point is, what those axioms that we use to begin
our journey of following the science's whip, it's nothing to do with what the epidemiology
says.
Instead, epidemiology or science in general is used as a tool to accentuate ethical contentions
in this debate.
At the minimum, we all used economics, politics, science, our personal intuitions, insight,
etc., and did a sort of multivariate analysis consciously or subconsciously.
The scientific facts itself never makes a decision for us because they simply can't
do so.
Rather, these facts were always filtered through a philosophical framework, or more accurately,
an indispensable narrative structure, the Seneca-Anon, that a person uses to interpret
and filter through reality.
Therefore, speaking somewhat figuratively, the moment human consciousness becomes part
of the equation, a fact value, and a is-orred distinction is created.
So a big part of the whole COVID debate, of course, was the idea of safety.
We took all these measures so that we can be safe.
But safety itself isn't a scientific value.
It isn't exist in the domain of science.
Safety is actually deeply subjective.
Some people are more risk averse, some people are more tolerant towards risks, and these
things differ broadly in a massive society.
People don't want the same things.
Some people value safety over freedom, and people like me value freedom over safety.
We just simply have to make trade-offs depending on our values.
And all these different groups, let's say, hypothetically, even in a perfect world,
were given the same exact scientific findings, the same exact scientific data.
This is what they were exposed to.
They would all come up with different conclusions.
They'd all have different ending points, because their axioms, their starting points,
or let's call it their odds and odds, or nots, are different.
And these ethics that herald our actions, so to speak, they come from a much deeper
set of moral values, something that is beyond science, something that's beyond rationality,
that's something that's, I'd even argue, transcendent.
It goes in the domain of religious and the domain of mythology and narrative.
And in the domain of values, in the domain of the religious, the verification method
or positivism or whatever you call it, that has worked so well in the scientific domain,
in the scientific enterprise, isn't simply going to work.
It's where reason and rationality, culturally speaking, runs out.
And I'm going to say something which some people are quite adverse to.
It goes to the domain of the mystical, the transcendentally ineffable, and all these
things that we've taken for granted for the longest time.
To use a union term, I think these values, these deeply held moral values or these deeply
held stories that, let's say, imbue our moral values to use a union term are embedded in
our collective unconscious.
And of course, needless to say, none of these ideas come from me.
Philosophers, religious thinkers have been trying to debate, understand, and seek out
answers to these questions since time immemorial, reading a bit of philosophy.
It's actually a beautiful experience knowing that people have always pondered and thought
about these questions, and it's always been a part of the wisdom tradition, and it's
always been something everyone's spoken about a lot, even though I think now it's spoken
about less.
But then again, a recent acclaimed conversation that took place a couple of years ago, the
debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris on truth and morality is a good example on
how pertinent these ideas are to our life.
And even though I hate to reduce such rich conversations to a bunch of propositions,
I have to do so for the sake of brevity.
The gist of the debate was Harris believes values and moral principles can be derived
or inferred from facts.
Much like he does in his book, The Moral Landscape, he challenges Hume's yes ord problem and
asserts and ought what to do can be derived from a what is on the grounds of increasing
well-being.
This reason, of course, disagrees.
However, unlike most of Sam's debate is, he doesn't merely place a somewhat arbitrary
goal as an unforeseeable propositional axiom.
Rather, he sees religious narrative and story which involves God as being an ontic point
for us to live and act in this world.
As a union, he tries to demonstrate how archetypes act as intermediary structures to arrange the
facts in such a way to imbue values.
According to him, stories aren't true in the sense of a scientific fact, but they are
meditates by marshalling our actions on what to do with the fact.
So Harris' claims of increasing well-being is essentially a narrativized, necessary axiomatic
presupposition that prevents an infinite regress, which is not a fact.
I don't know if I have a stance on this matter.
I don't think anyone really truly has a stance on this matter and if anyone does, either
they're lying or they're just being unbelievably hubristic.
But I would say that I happen to stand or agree a lot more with Peterson than Sam Harris.
The more I've poured about and I'd even say struggled with these questions, I think I've
come to the realization that one cannot infer values from facts or values from truth, let's
say, without being self-referential and presuppositional.
My best intuition of this, I'd say, actually comes from someone I've been reading recently,
Mr. Nietzsche, his idea, his philosophy of perspectivism, where we can't devose our observation
or our understanding of the world from our perspective.
We don't just observe the world plainly without any perspective or without...
We are a conscious being where the world is observed and filtered through us.
So in this filtering process, we do have a values framework.
We have certain narratives and beliefs that we hold and knowingly or unknowingly, the
world is interpreted through this.
Interestingly, speaking about Nietzsche, he also makes a point in Döngeren Evel and
I think a couple of his other books that Christianity by its this ardent and vigorous drive, let's
say, towards truth.
Because in Christianity, truth is the highest ideal, Christ himself is the embodiment of
truth that Christianity ended up destroying itself by giving rise to science.
I don't think I know what to make of that statement.
I don't know what that tells us about contemporary society.
However, that does lead me to probably one of the most radical and incomprehensible points
for us modern people that made by Jonathan Pejo, a Christian near-playtoness, where he
explicated how science is nested within religion.
Not in some inadvertent, pragmatic or inspirational sense where religion inspired people to do
science, but rather that without religion itself, literally, science cannot exist.
Apart from the enigmatic kind, Jonathan Pejo's work has had the biggest influence in changing
my view on science.
He helped me realize that science has a problem.
Science cannot define or categorize itself, and as a result, it has to make arbitrary
mercurial axioms.
And this always goes wrong, as we see from the politicization of science these days.
One of Jonathan's contemporaries and another intellectual hero of mine, John Reiki, explains
this paradoxical dilemma of science best in Jordan Peterson's podcast.
Science?
Does science exist?
Okay, if it is, what kind of entity is it?
And tell me, using physics or chemistry or even biology, use just though that ontology
and those methodology, tell me what science is, and tell me how it has the status to make
the claims it does, and tell me how science is related to meaning and truth, and how do
meaning and truth fit into the scientific worldview?
They're presupposed by that worldview, but they have no proper place within it.
That's what I mean.
Whenever we're doing the science and saying, this is what the world is, we are absenting
ourselves from it.
We have no home in which we are properly situated, and I think that ramifies through everything
we think, say, and do to each other and with each other in a profoundly corrosive way.
That's what I mean by the meaning.
So this problem, John the Pagel replies with explanation of the hierarchy of values, using
symbolism and religious language of the neo-Paytonist kind.
He postulates that as science itself is a product of consciousness, it cannot exist without
a higher, all-encompassing framework, which ultimately is what religious language attempts
to portray.
In this video, using the example of a mountain, Jonathan points out that such language is
a type of meta-language or meta-process that contains science within it, and in some sense
gives it meaning.
In relation to modern science, religious language would be something of a meta-process
or a meta-language, because it tries to express the thing it is focusing on, let's say a
mountain, while also expressing the process by which that focus is even possible.
So if modern science can describe a mountain, height, width, terrain, its foliage, its mineral
constitution, religious language is expressing why I have a category like mountain in the
first place, why that category is relevant to humans, basically, what does a mountain
mean?
So the scientists will retort something like this, will retort something like a mountain
doesn't mean anything, but to say so is to ignore the human variable, ignore that we
are the ones looking at the mountain, even if I believe that that mountain is outside
of my tiny existence, it ignores consciousness, ignores why I would bother to have a category
like mountain, it ignores that I have to climb a mountain or go around a mountain when it's
in my way, it ignores the effect going up a mountain has on human consciousness.
All those things are real, there are no more illusions than the scientific data, symbolism
tries to take all of that into account, that is discuss a mountain without pretending that
we are not human beings living in a world of mountains.
So it does have a personal and social aspect to it, because it takes into account consciousness,
but it isn't just personal and social, and also taking consciousness into account doesn't
mean that it's a relative thing and subjective in the way that we see that word today, subjective
in the sense of idiosyncratic, arbitrary to my own particularities and preclivities, there's
a universal aspect to the experience of a mountain.
So the religious language is above the scientific language and contains the scientific process
within it, makes it possible.
You know a lot of caveats have been added in this video I think, but I do want to add
another one, I want to make this after I listen to a debate between Jonathan Pedro and rationally
roots, the reality of what Jonathan is talking about, to understand that, or even to understand
the fact value distinction, it truly does require a rather radical paradigm shift in
one's thinking, but also I think more importantly, we really have to start paying attention to
our conscious experience.
It's funny, a lot of these skeptics or rationalists always say, follow the evidence, I go where
the evidence leads me, and I can't believe how much people can lack in self-awareness
to believe that they're so open minded.
I don't think any of us are as open minded or let's say we are like a sponge that just
absorbs evidence and just changes our worldviews based on the evidence the way we think we'd
like to be.
It's really difficult to change our mind, so at least I'd say I'm going to be honest,
I find it quite hard to change my mind.
I don't think I could just follow the evidence and just go where it leads.
I don't think that's how my mind works and I think apart from the problem of the fact
value distinction, that kind of metaphysical philosophical debate that I spoke about before,
I think reality is human psychology, we simply just don't change our minds like that.
And since I used to work with psychology, maybe now is a good time to move to a section
of this video that's a bit more tolerable.
I've been talking about these obstruous philosophies for a while, metaphysics and all that, which
can be rather hard to grasp and let's be honest, in some sense we are all confined in our way
of thinking.
We are all confined to, in many ways, we all think the way the Enlightenment philosophers,
we modern society, we all think the way Enlightenment philosophers told us the thing, that that's
how we were told to perceive and understand the world and as Wittgenstein so brilliantly
put it, once you climb up that Wittgensteinian ladder of just philosophy and propositions
or rationality, let's say, one must transcend it, one must throw it away and move beyond
it.
So I'm not going to be transcending that ladder or going to a different philosophy, rather
I'll be coming to something a bit more grounded, a topic that I think we can understand a bit
more, which is psychology.
And that leads me to a point which I've been trying to understand and probably explicate
in some way, it is that utopian thinking, scientific utopianism, any kind of utopian
thinking is, psychologically speaking, essentially totalitarian.
And understanding why the psychology of utopianism is totalitarian isn't some philosophical game,
at least in the analytical sense, it's rather deeply experiential.
It's having this unbelievable amount of self-awareness where when one has a thought, where one has
an idea or some kind of ideal one striving towards, I think it's really important to
be deeply introspective and I'd even say try and observe oneself without any moral judgment
from a third person perspective.
See what emotions rise, see what makes me or whoever, why am I thinking this way?
Am I being totalitarian?
Am I being absolutist in my quote-unquote remedies to the world's problems or my own problems?
And I think then we all come to the realization that utopianism is always totalitarian in nature.
Because knowing oneself is knowing how one comes to their conclusion, it's good or bad,
and what we're capable of doing once we have those conclusions.
And to be honest, sometimes that's a deeply terrifying realization.
As psychoanalysts have told us, human beings have an innate nature to us, however this
doesn't necessarily mean we're all the same, we differ in our interests, temperaments,
proclivities, idiosyncrasies and certainly physiologically.
Manifest example of these differences is shown in the moral foundations theory, popularized
in Jonathan Hyde's book The Righteous Mind.
The basic idea of the theory is that our moral intuitions come from certain foundations and
concerns.
Some of these even mutually opposed, that we nonetheless value in informing the moral
basis for our beliefs.
It could be because of these fundamental differences we find it difficult to see out of eye on
social, religious and political matters.
And so far I don't think any of these findings are controversial or worrisome.
I don't think we need a thorough knowledge of social psychology to understand that we
all differ, even though it might help us empathize more with people of different views to our
own if we know how and why they develop these worldviews.
But what deeply perturbs me is the claim Jonathan Hyde makes in his book of social intuitionism.
There be former abuse through intuition rather than rationality and furthermore we actually
use rational port to justify our initial belief.
Using the elephant and the rider metaphor, he says we don't come to our beliefs through
rationality as some of the enlightenment thinkers would like to proclaim.
One of the oldest ideas in intellectual history is the idea that the mind is divided into
parts that sometimes conflict.
And wherever you look east or west, there's sort of an idea that there's some sort of
higher, more reasoning area and then some sort of lower, more animal-like faculty.
Plato gives us many metaphors in the Timaeus.
He says that the gods created mankind, they put reason in those orbs, and orbs had a role
on the ground, so we had to create the bodies.
So that's one metaphor.
The other is the Phaedrus reason is the charioteer and the passions, the noble passions of the
base passions are the horses.
And if a man studies philosophy and learns to control those passions, then he can escape
the bondage of reincarnation and return to the gods.
Now I think this view, the idea that reason, of course Plato didn't say that reason is
the master in most people, but he said it can be, it is in philosophers and everyone
should strive for it, so he believed it was possible.
I think this view of reason has taken quite a beating since the 1990s, certainly from
the neuroscientists who found that when you lose your emotionaries, you don't get hyper-rational.
In fact, you either become unable to really think because reasoning actually depends critically
on emotion and intuition, or if you're still able to think at all, you become more like
a psychopath who simply doesn't have any emotions in forming his reasoning.
So I think the reason as master view has taken quite a beating, and I'll give it more of
a beating, model two, the idea that reason is a servant.
This is, as you know, the model that I endorse, that reason is a great helper, but it simply
is not qualified to lead.
But rather than speaking of reason as a slave, which is Hume's word, or a servant, I think
if we think about it as a really intelligent servant, really more like a press secretary.
This is Robert Gibbs, Obama's first press secretary, and he's a very, very smart guy.
They're partners, they work together, but you will never change Obama's mind by convincing
his press secretary that something is wrong.
It's just not the way the system's designed, so it just structurally can't happen that
way.
Now, Hume said that the passions were the master.
Jesse Prince embraces emotion straight out.
He says we can do all this work with emotion.
I used to think that in the 90s.
I don't think that anymore.
I think we really need to talk about intuition more broadly.
A lot of the things I've studied have been moral emotions, but as you'll see, there are
many cases of gut feelings that aren't exactly emotions.
Now, you might say, well, okay, maybe reason's not the master, but it could certainly be
an equal partner.
This is the view that Josh Green has and that Darshan Arvayas has.
Green gives us the idea of Kant and Mill fighting it out in the brain.
Darshan Arvayas uses the metaphor of dancing.
Now, it seems to me that if you have dancing, you have one person leading, the other following,
but she says, well, it's a different kind of dancing where they take turns.
But even if you downgrade it from master to equal partner, is the evidence that we have
on reasoning, is that consistent with reason even playing an equal partner role?
Is reasoning good enough, independent enough to play the role of equal partner?
I don't think so.
So the science that we hold in such high regard, much like reason, is merely a tool to be used
by our emotions and intuitions.
We may like to think in a sort of blank slate kind of way where these emotionless, intuitionless
automatons that simply follow the facts.
And once we have all the facts, we come to our conclusions, but we are not.
And on a bit of a side note, I personally like the fact that we simply aren't these automotons.
I like the fact that we have emotions.
We are deeply feeling creatures.
We aren't just merely governed by reason alone.
Now, I don't have time to get into it, but I would leave a link down below to a great,
essay or story, a sort of allegorical story by Raymond Smollion called A Planet Without
Laughter, where he describes the paradox of what it would be like living in a reality
where we are only governed by reason.
Anyways, I digress.
Getting back to the video, the problem now is whatever conclusion that we've come to,
we believe that we came to this viewpoint using reason and mere facts alone.
And we think that regardless of the consequences, whatever the outcome of our conclusion is,
we must push through just by the consequences, because we think the conclusion we have,
the viewpoint we hold now, this is absolute truth, because I came to this conclusion
based purely on facts.
Therefore, I must hold the truth.
And it just makes sense to go ahead and let that truth, let's say, actualize in the world.
It's in this kind of self-referential, self-fulfilling way of thinking what I mean by
totalitarian.
It's to bring forth the utopia we will do whatever it takes because we are 100%
absolutely accurate in our conclusions.
And in modern times, this torturizing mentality manifests in many ways,
but I think the most salient way is in the name of science and reason.
It's very common for us to see a Ben Shapiro destroy someone with facts and logic,
because he's got the facts, he's got the logic, he's got all the answers.
Therefore, he is absolutely right.
You know, Ben Shapiro is a right-wing conservative guy and it's a complete lie that the right
wing is anti-science or the left wing is anti-science or vice versa or whatever.
None of these sides are anti-science or anti-recent.
They're both pro-science and pro-recent, but the problem is they both think that they come
to their truth merely by using science and reason alone.
But no, both these sides don't come to their conclusions from just facts.
They come to their conclusions to keep it a bit more grounded, let's say,
at least based on their moral foundations.
So science, again, just becomes a means to an end, that end which is created through
their moral foundations.
And these moral foundations, left-wing, right-wing, conservative, liberal, whatever,
doesn't matter.
These foundations aren't derived using a scientific method because they aren't scientific
truths and I'd even say science isn't the only way to get at truth.
And my fear, of course, is because our society is so deeply, for all it's good,
influenced by enlightenment thinking, and both sides, right or left, whatever,
are influenced by science and reason, there's that aspect of totalitarianism that comes in
and we move towards the dangers of scientific utopianism.
You believe in the Crystal Palace, eternally indestructible.
That is one at which you can never stick out your tongue furtively,
nor make a rude gesture, even with your fist head in the way.
Well, perhaps I'm so afraid of this building, precisely because it's made of crystal
and it's eternally indestructible, and because it won't be possible to stick out one's tongue
even furtively.
So what's this Crystal Palace Dostoevsky writes about?
It's actually based on a real monument from the 19th century and I think it's deeply,
in a very profound way, pertinent in a symbolic sense, I'd say,
to the society we live in.
It was this vast exhibition hall, built of glass and iron in London,
to house this great exhibition of 1851, and for the time it was very technologically advanced,
and anyways, the specificities of it doesn't matter, what matters is, as I said,
what it symbolizes.
In Russian literature, along with the industrial revolution, it symbolizes progress and this
move towards the utopian society.
There were authors like Shonyshevsky who used it to represent these utopian socialist communes
that the people of the future would live in, and of course, Dostoevsky rebukes his claims
and says that, no, human beings don't desire utopia, even if there was a utopia,
we would end up destroying it because that's not what our heart really wants.
You know, my reading of Notes from Underground, which probably is the book that I've read the
most in my life, is that I think what Dostoevsky is trying to say is that the human soul,
like human beings are obviously very, very incomprehensible beings,
and we are all walking paradoxes, you know.
In our souls, yes, we want to be safe, you want to be happy and live a good life with
well-being and all of that, but at the same time, we also want to be free, in some sense,
existentially free, and we would desire being free than over living in so-called
paradise of the utopia. If we do live in a so-called utopian paradise, if we didn't have this
freedom of conscience, freedom in our soul to do as we will in that paradise, we would still not
prefer that. We'd still rather suffer and be free than not be free and not have any suffering.
So before I go on and on about Dostoevsky, which I could do forever because I absolutely
love his work, a good question to ask is, why does any of this, the Crystal Palace,
all of it, why does it matter to our times? I think it's quite straightforward. It's because
what the Crystal Palace represents is the modern AI project, and I think Lex, as much as I love him,
very much falls to this kind of, I guess, trap or this way of thinking about AI the same way,
maybe thinkers of that time thought about the Crystal Palace. We look to technology to be our
savior. We look to AI or whatever it is to be humanity's redeemer, savior, and to be the means
that gets us to utopia. Such utopian thinking isn't necessarily a modern phenomenon, nor is it merely
a product of scientific advancement. For example, we see forms of it in the Tower of Babel, a very
ancient story from the Bible. My point being, it's not the object or theory we project this
desire onto that matters, but the psychic phenomena of that desire itself. It doesn't matter if it's
the Tower of Babel, Crystal Palace, AI, or Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Rationalism. What we should
be attentive towards is the totalizing impulse we have to attribute a certain thing, scientific or
not, to be the panacea to all our problems. Furthermore, since utopianism inevitably becomes
totalitarian, it is all-encompassing and doesn't leave any room for fragments of being that are
outside a given utopian ideology. It's a similar idea that Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot
discussed in a recent podcast about the key difference between heaven and utopia.
Heaven is generally conceptualized. You can conceptualize it as a state of being. It might
be the state of being that those people that you describe live in have had paradisal experiences
where everything transformed itself into something that was perfect, that appeared perfect,
and I was unable to stay in those frames of mind. The heaven, is that something we build?
Is that something? I don't understand the relationship between the heaven that awaits us,
let's say, after we die. That's the idea and what we build here on earth. Do those touches?
Is that the doctrine? There's so much of this doctrine I don't understand.
At all. I think a way to see it has to do with attention again, and it has to do with a hierarchy
of attention. If you try to build heaven, you're going to fail. You're going to fail miserably
because you're not aiming high enough. You're aiming and then you get stuck in this
in these weird world of opposites that you don't even understand the side effects of what you're
doing. For one person, heaven will look like if everything could be perfectly ordered then,
right, and then we know what that looks like. Another person will look at heaven and think,
if everything could be free, we could all just be free and then that we know what that looks like.
The idea is to look higher. There's a story that I've been having.
We have to strive for something better, but then we end up, which is what you're saying,
is that we end up with the Tower of Babel, or we end up with the Flood, or we end up with
the catastrophe, continual catastrophe of unintended consequences. But as you yourself
said, we are aiming for something better. The question is, how do you pursue Utopia
while avoiding the pitfalls? That's a theological question. Yeah, it is. I think it,
I know people are going to hate that I say this, but it has to do with worship. It has to do with
what you worship. So if you worship those things that you're aiming towards, the lower things,
if you worship the making a safer society, if you worship the making a freer society,
if you worship making a stronger society, all of these things are going to go off the rails
because they have unintended consequences that you don't understand because they're a fragment
of reality. They need to be encompassed together in order to reach something higher.
That's the danger of ideology. It's the part that takes the place of the whole.
The idea is that if you worship God, then those other things will
will kind of lay themselves out slowly and you won't be able to force them. They'll kind of lay
themselves out slowly and they'll start to manifest, you know, progressively and as you,
but you have to attend to the highest. With scientific utopianism, one value is divinized
and science becomes the means to bring forth the ends. The safety, freedom, order, or even
technological progress with no regard to any other value, or even the ramifications of said value.
And since science itself is only a tool that's malleable and has no way of justifying the
means it uses, that one value that all utopians pursue become the only thing that matters.
There's no balance, no nuance, no context as utopianism lacks and hierarchy of values.
After all, utopia was derived from the Greek meaning nowhere and there probably is a good
reason for that. Regardless of our philosophical or religious beliefs, I think a laudable goal for
all of us, I'd even say the motivating spirit of the scientific enterprise should be to bring heaven
on earth. I truly believe a lot of people, especially those like Lex, who just have a
big heart and just truly loves life and humanity and everything that comes along with the baggage of
being, let's say. I believe the goal of most scientists and a lot of people is this, it's to
make life on earth better. It's the motivating spirit, it's to in some sense, yes, to bring heaven
on earth. And this is in no way an anti-science or even worse an anti-scientist video. I really hope I
didn't convey that I was being cynical in that sense because absolutely not. I mean, I work in
computer science, I'm a software engineer and my field wouldn't exist if not for this world of science
that I review and love so much. I could never forgive myself for such lazy, casual cynicism.
Rather, the intent or the purpose of this video was to try and contextualize science. It was to try
and understand in the hierarchical topology of our epistemology where the science stands. A lot
of big words I know, but put it plainly, in a broader culture, what's the role science plays?
Because I think by understanding this, we not only make the scientific enterprise, we not only
make that a much more fruitful endeavor, but we also make the human experience much more richer
and substantial. And Lex, of course, is a good example of what happens when the scientist and
the poet meets. So saying all that, please do consider sharing this video with Lex. That would
be a dream come true. Thanks for watching.
