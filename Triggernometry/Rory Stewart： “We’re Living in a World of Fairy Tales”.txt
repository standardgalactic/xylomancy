The problem is that democracy partly depends on fairy stories.
The trick of populism is that, of course, there's always a kernel of truth in this.
The point is not, is Farage right in his criticisms? The point is, what will he represent
and what would he do if he was in government? As with most of these things, when you try to do it,
you run into a lot of complication.
At the point where you go, well, I don't want to leave the ECHR because it's an
that's when the person says, well, in that case, F you, I'm voting for Farage.
And that's how you create populism.
When it works, you know, you're the great reformer, you're Margaret Thatcher.
When it doesn't work, you're this trust. You're a
affectless, impudent, foolish person who didn't bother to take decent advice.
Ross, you're welcome to Trigonometry. It's great to finally have you on.
Really looking forward to speaking with you. The first thing we wanted to talk to you about is,
obviously, this is going out after the election, but you've made it clear that you are not
supporting the conservatives in this one and perhaps maybe even going as far left as the Greens.
So what does conservatism mean to you? What is it conservative in your definition?
It means that it famously, the problem with conservative politics is that it's very difficult
to define. But I suppose this left-right division exists in every country. And one way of framing
it is that the left tends to have a very optimistic, progressive vision of the future.
And conservatives tend to be more respectful of the way things are tradition in the past.
In a UK context, that means having a different relationship to history, to landscape,
to architecture, to constitution. And I suppose a different sense of what identity is.
I mean, the question is for any politician in any country has to be, to some extent,
a nationalist, moderate nationalist, you can be an extreme nationalist, but you are
representing this country. And what is that thing that you're representing?
Is there an identity to that place that makes it distinct from other places that's been inherited
from the past? Is it just the group of people who are alive today, or is it also the people who
lived and died, the people who are yet to be born? What kind of obligations do we have to the
past and the future? What are our ideas of values, truth, you see? And these aren't things
which are very difficult, which are easy to articulate, because generally speaking,
contemporary politics gets very quickly into a conversation about money.
So that being the case, I guess what I'm getting at is, what are your
disagreements and frustrations with the state of the conservative family in the UK more broadly
that have caused you to move so far away from it while still calling yourself a conservative?
Because you're not saying, I've become a green, are you? You still claim to be conservative.
So what is that dissonance? So I think it's largely about moral values. So for me,
Boris Johnson was a ludicrous dishonest buffoon who should never have been allowed to be
prime minister, and he was facilitated by my colleagues in the Conservative Party.
Liz Truss was a reckless, risk-taking, glib prime minister who did huge damage to our economy
and should never have been enabled by the Conservative Party. The hard version of Brexit
that was pursued was divisive and damaging when the Conservative Party had an opportunity to
bring the country together and try to find a compromise. And so I think in terms of ethical
standards, they let themselves down with Boris Johnson, in terms of thoughtful policy, they let
themselves down with Liz Truss, and in terms of an idea of politics as finding compromise in the
central ground, they let themselves down with a hard Brexit. So it's a sense that they
betrayed important values, much more than the question of right or left.
Rory, as well, there's a competency crisis, I would argue, in the Conservative Party. You look at
the country they inherited in 2010, and you look at the country that they're handing over
to the Labour Party. I mean, let's be fair, the Labour Party going to win, we all know it.
I would argue the country is in a worse state after a 14-year Conservative term than it was before.
Yeah, yeah, sure. And how does that make you feel as a Conservative that this was the party
that you believed in that you were part of, and seeing the way that the country has been handled?
Well, I think how I feel doesn't interest me very much. I think what I think is
interesting is the way that you frame that. So I think you've got two things going there.
Countries in a worse state, I agree. But you ascribe it to a competency crisis. So you have
some idea in your head that somehow, if there had been some other group of people, these kind of
super-competent people, the country wouldn't be in the mess that it's in. And that depends how much
you think that the problems that we face in this country are actually quite structural,
quite deep, quite difficult. And how much you think it's just down to the fact that
Rishi Sunak's no good at his job. My guess is that these problems that we face are very similar
to the problems that people are facing in France, that they're facing in Germany, that they'll
eventually face the United States. They are much more to do with a population's aging.
So what's the single biggest fact that explains the problems the NHS is that we have
twice as many people aged over 85 compared to where we were in 1979. And each one of those people
cost 10 times as much as somebody aged between 18 and 25 to deal with. Second problem, COVID.
For better or for worse, this government, but with the agreement of Labour and Lib Dems,
a huge consensus around this, decided to lock the country down, took the biggest recession
that the country had experienced in 300 years and spent £400 billion, that's £400,000 million
in payouts and support for people during COVID, which have now left us with this enormous debt.
These are the real fundamentals. And there are other things that we don't quite understand
around the fringes. There are 800,000 people economically inactive, which isn't happening
in other countries, but nobody really understands why that's happening. We are an economy and a
structure that's incredibly dependent on immigration. So the government's taken in
about 1.4 million people net over the last two years. Why? Well, because if you go to a hospital,
you go to care. And you discover that all the people with the skills and nursing care and medicine
are not from Britain, they're from other countries. And the country can only run on that basis.
On the other hand, we have a population that doesn't want more immigration.
And has a point, because we're also shorter houses, you bring in 1.4 million more people,
where are they going to live? Where's the road infrastructure? Where are the schools to support
them? And if you're creating a pyramid where you're always supporting your older people by
bringing in more and more young people, well, that logically is just going to keep expanding
until you'd end up with a population of 150 million people in what's already the most
populated country on earth. So I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I fear you will find that
things are not much better after five years of labor government. And then you will be tempted to say,
look at these bunch of incompetence, because we're not prepared to step back enough and see that
fundamentally, the problems are not about whether or not Rishi Sunak's bright or does his job well.
Fundamentally, the problems are that we haven't managed to face these structuralists use as a
country. I agree with you. But my argument is not particularly with Rishi Sunak. It's a conservative
party as a whole. When they came in in 2010, they knew that there was a housing crisis. They
have done little or nothing to solve that problem. And we're talking about we have a population crisis,
not enough babies are being born. Well, if you don't allow young people to get on the housing ladder
to actually be to buy a place so that they can settle down, get married, have children,
then isn't that the natural reaction to your own inability or unwillingness to deal with this one
thing? So first thing is that there's been a terrible failure on housing. You're right.
But maybe the thing you're not acknowledging is that this was one of their number one priorities.
So they set building 300,000 houses a year as being a top priority.
They put a lot of the most talented, competent people in the government behind trying to build
those houses. People like Michael Gove, Oliver Letwin, Greg Clarke were given these portfolios
and they failed. So why did they fail? And that's what I'm going to flip around to you,
because you seem to imagine that that failure is somehow a failure of what?
Well, what are you hinting at, Rory? Because you've talked in the past and we've had people on the
show, some of whom you've just criticized, by the way, like Liz Truss, Sir LeBravim and others,
Steve Hilton, David Cameron's former advisor, who all made the same point that you've made in
the past, which is it's actually very, very hard to get anything done when you're elected,
because the civil service won't let you, essentially. It's kind of fairly simple as that.
Is that what you're hinting at? Or is there something else going on that you think is causing
us to not be able to solve our problems? I think the structure is immobilizing people everywhere.
So that's why I'm doubtful that Labour will be able to address these issues.
We're equally doubtful, by the way. So what are the problems? Well, look, I've written a book
called Politics on the Edge, which is trying to talk in detail about some of the issues of
getting anything done as a minister, and some of that is about civil service.
But there's a broader question about the public. I mean, why is it that these houses are not being
built? The way in which planning works, our concerns about biodiversity and climate,
our concerns about landscape, our concerns about rural communities,
the way in which ownership structures work in development companies, the way in which
land income operates. So the minister trying to say, I want to build houses,
is looking at 15 different factors, all of which needs to be his on the head separately.
Biodiversity, right? One of the things that stops building is that for very good reasons,
we care about species, nature, biodiversity, water, and that rules out quite a lot of sites
quite quickly. We care about archaeology, and if you find a sense of archaeological site,
that also has an impact on planning. We care about democracy, we care about local consultation,
right? We want to feel that a local town or village can say we object, we think this could
be built in a better way. Why do they get stuff built in China very quickly? They don't care,
and drive it through. But we have to be a bit more honest about what the trade-offs are here.
We have a dream that this kind of competent technocratic government is going to come in,
but usually our dream is based on a culture or a society very unlike our own,
in which the Chinese government will literally move an entire community to drive a train line
through. They will ultimately imprison people if they object. I mean, I've been through this in
my own neighborhood here in South Kent. They've been trying since before I was born, since 1972,
to build something on top of the tube session, and it's been blocked again and again for 51 years.
Finally, they've managed to get it through, and we're all outraged.
Why are we outraged? We're outraged because it's not delivering affordable housing,
because the architect is ugly, because it's bringing in a supermarket that's going to destroy
the local shops. We're all saying we're in favor of development, but we want development that is
beautiful delivers affordable housing and doesn't destroy local shops. Transport for London is saying
we've got to generate money here. We've got to get a lift into South Kent tube session,
and the way to do it is to build this rather ugly, large structure and bring in a supermarket.
And that's kind of microcosm of what's happening in every community around this country, that
all of us want more housing in theory, all of us want more development,
but in practice, we're all very bright, educated, well-informed people who care passionately about
our era. And as soon as you propose anything, that's not quite that we're mimbies. It's that we've
all able to come up with 50 arguments for why they shouldn't be doing it in quite the way they're
doing it. So that to me seems like an area where leadership is required because leadership is about
selling people on the idea that you and I have to sacrifice a little bit because you and I are
going to have grandchildren one day and we want them to be able to buy a flat before they're 40.
Right. But if I take the example of South Kent tube session, I turn around to you,
say the leader, my grandchildren, I turn around and say, no, no, no. My proposal has more affordable
housing than your proposal. Okay. And to which Transport for London says the economics don't
work. We can't generate the money delivering the affordable housing. Then that seems like a fair
trade-off to me. The Transport for London building it's ugly stuff. Yeah. Okay. But if we look at
London, this philosophy of building has resulted in nine elms, has resulted in 50, 60,000 unaffordable
apartment blocks going up because the developers are trying to build as quickly as possible and
generate as much money as possible. And it's not resulting in affordable housing. What I think we
need is millions more council houses. But to build council houses on Transport for London or
Merrill London land would involve totally changing our financial model. We'd have to accept much
lower returns. You could do it financially. I mean, you could borrow the money, you could invest,
and you could get income back, but it would be a much lower return than we're used to getting.
And I don't see anybody yet prepared to say, we're not going to finance Transport for London
off property development. We're going to make these plots of land not lose money, but we're not
going to try to generate big bucks off them. Why not? Why won't anyone say that? Because
that would require the taxpayer putting more of their taxes into running Transport for London.
So if Transport for London doesn't finance the signalling on the Piccadilly line or the new lift
off cheap property development that doesn't deliver affordable housing, somebody else has
got to pay for it. And that will mean not the property developer is paying for it,
means the rest of us are paying for it either through higher tube fares or paying bigger taxes.
So the whole of the British government is kind of, is often different versions of Ponzi schemes
where in order to avoid charging people taxes, which seem to be unpopular,
we end up doing these weird financing initiatives, a lot of which is trying to crowd in money from
the private sector by offering them profit and return for money being subsidised in government.
So that being the case, Rory, looking at the Conservative Party,
does it actually have a future in its current state?
Well, I'm worried about the Conservative Party. I mean, I'm very worried that they are
going to be tempted to lurch towards a kind of Nigel Farage reform wing,
and that the reason why they'll probably lurch towards that wing is that
Keir Salma has now occupied the centre ground, and the risk is that over the next five years,
for a lot of the problems we've talked about in this show, they're not going to be able to deliver.
You know, Keir Salma will not be able to do stuff in the next five years, and that will provide more
opportunity for populists. Because, I mean, we can see it. We can see it in Canada, where Trudeau
is not performing, we can see it in Germany, where Schultz is not performing, we can see it in France,
where Macron is not performing. In all these cases, you have people who are broad,
speaking centre-left, moderate, fiscally conservative politicians, just not delivering.
And the reason they're not delivering is because of the kind of big structures of the way we're
aging, the way our economies work, the way our welfare states are financed. And, you know, we
want, of course, in the way that you're doing now, to say, well, so, you know, what does that mean
for the Tory party? What does that mean for the Labour Party? And we want to find villains.
We want to say these guys aren't competent, these guys are terrible, because it's quite
cheering up. I mean, if that's the case, then our life's about to get much better. It'd be
lovely if we lived in a world and... Or let me retrain. Nobody in this room is under the illusion
that life's about to get much better. Nobody, honestly, I'm not thinking there's Dawn Butler
coming to the rescue. Right. But the problem is that democracy partly depends on fairy stories.
Depends on an idea. You vote out one party, you vote in another. Stuff's going to change,
get better. That if things are bad, it's because there are a bunch of idiots in power.
If we look at someone like Rishi Sunak, who is he? He's a, you know, he's a bright, hard-working,
diligent guy. I mean, I've got big problems with him. I've got problems with his sense of vision,
his leadership. Why? Why have I got problems with him?
I'm with Rishi Sunak. I've got problems with him because
he's not able to step back and see the bigger picture. But it's not that I think he's,
his problem is that he's, the normal way he's criticised is, you know, he's kind of privileged,
he's out of touch, he's entitled, he's corrupt, he's, you know, his wife's making money,
he's incompetent, he's cruel. I don't think any of that's true. I think the guy's, you know,
brighter than us, he's more hardworking than us, he's more, you know, he's a, he would be a successful
banker, a successful lawyer, you know, be successful in almost any business. He's just no good as
prime minister. And that's because the qualities you require are very unusual. They require an
incredible extent of courage, vision, values, moral integrity, which is extremely improbable
for any of us to generate. To do what, Rory? You keep hinting at
these big structural problems or even explicitly describing them and no one, I think, would
disagree with your analysis. But the question is, if somebody came along who was this perfect
prime minister, Al Arori Stewart, what would they then go and do? What do you think actually needs doing?
We'll get you back to the interview in a minute, but first, that my friends is the sound of another
sale on Shopify, the all in one commerce platform to start, run and grow your business. I know that
building a business takes work. Look at my face, I'm exhausted. But the lovely thing about Shopify
is that no matter how big you want to grow, Shopify is with you every step of the way.
Shopify is a commerce platform revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide. Whether you're
selling handmade jewelry, art prints or podcast merch like us by our merch, Shopify simplifies
selling online and in person so you can successfully grow your business. Shopify even gets you selling
across social media marketplaces like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. TikTok just makes me angry,
I'm too old. So, if you're ready to get serious about selling, sign up for a £1 per month trial
period at Shopify.co.uk slash trigger. Go to Shopify.co.uk slash trigger. And one more time for luck,
that Shopify.co.uk slash trigger. And now, back to the interview.
What do you think actually needs doing?
Reform of the NHS, dramatically. I mean, it's now chewing up four out of every £10 of our current
expenditure. We're spending four times as much on the NHS as we were in 1979, in real terms,
twice as much in terms of our economy. And it's not delivering.
When you say reform, how? Because your argument is we've got way more older people who need way
more expensive care. How do you reform that?
We would have to stop doing, and reform always is the same thing. It's about prioritisation,
and prioritisation means you stop doing some things. So, it's very, very tough.
Oh, I can see that, yeah.
And so, basically, what you're saying to people is that there is nowhere in the world,
nowhere, except for Britain now, which is trying to maintain a system that doesn't have
which is trying to maintain a system that doesn't have a copay or insurance model as part of it.
So, reform the NHS, make it part copay. What else? What else does a bright,
visionary, courageous, principled leader need to do?
Planning reform is central. I mean, if we're to build infrastructure, we need to do that.
I think you probably, not probably, definitely from my point of view, you'd want to rejoin the
European Union customs union at least. Why is that so important?
Because we need to have very close economic and political relationships with our nearest neighbour.
And that's because trade partly works through proximity. That's because small and medium-sized
enterprises are desperately dependent on being able to do that kind of trade and being within a
customs area allows you to do it. But it's also a symbol to investors around the world.
Instead of Britain retreating, it's expanding back into larger areas. And that's also necessary
because there are no trade deals coming from China into all the US because we're in a world of
protectionism now, not in a world of free trade. Okay, so rejoin the customs union. What else?
AI. So, AI is the only thing that one can imagine transforming productivity.
But to get there, you would have to challenge unions. You would have to take some risk on
regulation. You'd have to take quite a lot of risk on results. You would have a lot of people
terrified about AI taking over functions that humans are currently doing. But productivity gains
basically means fewer humans doing the same thing. And AI is one of the ways of delivering that.
Anything else?
AI. Probably my main ones. So sorry, the final one, which is maybe more fundamental than any of
them, is that Britain isn't really run by politicians. It's run by our civil service,
and our civil service is enormous. How's the NHS run? It's not run by a sector state for health.
It consists of 1.1 million people. There are 350 million GP appointments a year.
The numbers are kind of staggering. So, the only way of running a good country is by improving
the quality of those people, how they are recruited, how they are promoted, how they are
trained. And that is a 20-year process of investment, of really thinking about how you
create a really elite professional civil service. And that also requires some very tough
conversations, because a lot of the things that I found as a minister that we're getting in the way,
I'll give you an example that I don't think I put in my book, but you know,
mattered to me and sort of illustrates some of the paradoxes. So, when I was the minister
responsible for part of the RF at during the Syrian war, I discovered that my Syrian team
was moved from London to East Kilbride near Glasgow, 400 miles away. Why? Because somebody
thought it would be great for the economy of this depressed area near Glasgow to have these civil
servants moved up there. So, I say, well, wait a second, we're fighting a war. Who's going to be in
the meetings with the Ministry of Defence? Who's going to be in the meetings with the Foreign
Office? All these meetings are happening in London. Oh, don't worry, Minister, people will always be
able to fly down. First, they say they can do it on Zoom, then I say, no, but that's not the point,
right? A lot of this stuff is happening in the margins of meetings. It's not just happening on the
Zoom call. But don't worry, they'll be able to fly down. Then I notice they're not flying down.
So, then I go up to Glasgow and I'm like, what's happening? And they say, oh, Minister, we've just
done a carbon audit and we've discovered that all these people were taking these flights.
So, we banned anybody from taking flights down from Glasgow to London.
Instead, people can do all this stuff virtually. Now, there are two very valuable things happening
here, right? Regeneration, revitalization, employment near Glasgow, and climate policy.
But what's lacking is what is the point of what they're doing? The point of what they're doing is
they're trying to get involved in our biggest national security priority, which is fighting a
war in Syria. And they're not there. And they're not helping. If the number one question you're
asking yourself, which is what is the most effective practical way to make a difference in Syria,
it is not to move these people up to Glasgow. But our civil service machine is brilliant
at prioritizing secondary issues and taking away from the fundamental question, which is
what is the most effective way of delivering what matters to the country?
Rory, what it seems to be, and there's a brilliant answer, thank you, is that underneath
everything that you're saying is an unwillingness to have uncomfortable conversations.
Do you think that's one of the real issue, actually, is the inability by politicians and every
other person to confront uncomfortable facts, whether it's about housing, whether it's about
the NHS, whether it's about geopolitics, et cetera, et cetera?
I think that's right. I think we live in a world of fairy stories. That's one of the reasons why
populists do well, but all the main parties also exist in a world of fairy stories. And one of the
most dominant fairy stories in our culture is that you don't need to choose, that you can always
have the best of all things in the best of all possible worlds. So that story I've just told
about Syria, many people will listening from the civil service will be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you don't need to choose. You can have regeneration and you can have good climate policy and you can
have a great situation in Syria. Or if I complain about the fact that my Yemen team,
my head of my Yemen team was working a job share. So I had one head of the Yemen team for two days
and another for three days in a week. And when I challenged it, everyone's like, well, this is
necessary for diversity. It's necessary to provide maternity cover. It's necessary for a good work
life balance that people are able to work half the week, right? I say that's fine, but the fact is
this is very inefficient because the person I'm talking to in the first two days doesn't know
anything about what I'm talking to in the last... Oh, no, no, minister, that's not true. They can do a
very, very good handover in the middle of the week. There's no way that it's going to have any
impact on efficiency, right? So we don't like challenging, right? We'll have something in our
head, which is a good thing. I'm not saying it's not a good thing. I personally
feel in my own life the lack of work life balance. I can see why, you know, from my life, from my
wife's life, why being able to work a three-day week can be incredibly important for a family,
for your own mental health, for the development of your children, for a healthy society,
particularly in a world where people can't afford childcare, all that stuff is true.
And I can completely understand why from a diversity point of view, if you want to keep
women in the workplace and have senior women in the workplace, you need to provide structures
to allow them to do that. But let's at least accept that sometimes you're making a choice
and that there are downsides as well as upsides. I mean, that's in a way what makes me a conservative,
that every bit of progress comes with a sacrifice.
It's a great Thomas Sowell line. There are no solutions, only trade-offs.
And what you're really saying to translate it into simple language, and you used to be a soldier,
is we're doing things for good reasons, but they're detrimental to the mission.
Yeah. That's what we're doing.
Yeah. Our whole society is a massive example of lots of things being done for good reasons,
which are detrimental to an effective, growing, productive, efficient public services economy
in society. Now, that may be fine if we acknowledge that, but of course, we don't like it.
We don't like the result. If we were like, okay, we've got nice democratic planning processes,
we support biodiversity, we support climate, we do good maternity cover, we're doing nice
regeneration projects, we're saving on climate. And the impact is our economy is not going to
grow so much. There are going to be big waiting lists at the NHS, our impact on the ground in
Syria is going to be pretty minimal, and inefficient, but that's okay.
Because we've got maternity cover.
Because we've got all that stuff. There's a lot of stuff that in many ways,
our values are better. We're living out our values. We just accept that we're not going to,
but of course, we're not like that. We want to have our cake and eat it all the time.
And this is one of the issues. I mean, maybe, obviously, there's a risk as a conservative,
it sounds like I'm just beating up on left-wing issues like maternity cover and climate.
I see similar things going on on the conservative side. So let me now have a go at the right.
People like this trust will have in their heads the answer to things is privatization,
getting in the market. And that also results in catastrophic consequences. So when I was
prison's minister, Chris Grayling, one of my colleagues, managed to privatize the probation
surface. On the basis of something that looked really beautiful on a bit of paper, all the
incentives were going to work out, the private sector was going to deliver, private prisons is
another example, it's going to be cheaper, private maintenance. It all turned out not to work at all,
would have been much better if the government had been doing it. Because of the risk profile,
because of the way these private sector companies are financed, because of the way in which they
go bankrupt and let you down, because of the way in which they keep the government over a barrel,
that's an example we've just been through. Fujitsu bids on the post office contracts against
themselves stuck in, they're making billions of pounds because the government can't extract
and suffer. There too, a different form of ideology is that leading to bad results. In that
case, the ideology is we believe in the market, private sector companies are much more efficient
in government. When actually it turns out that often the private sector is even more inefficient
than the government, even more wasteful than the government, and has the government over a barrel.
So it doesn't matter whether you're on right or left, we're suffering from a similar problem,
which is the way in which instead of really asking yourself, what am I trying to do here?
What's the most efficient way of getting there? We of course, as humans, put incredible
ideological blinders, preferences and things in, which really stop us getting results.
And I think one of the ideologies you're going to be particularly critical of, and I'd love to get
your view on this, is populism and what is happening. With looking across Europe, we can say
that it's a populist revolution. Reform, although they may not get a huge number of seats, they're
certainly going to do a lot of damage to the Conservative Party in particular. So what do
you make of all of that, Rory? So populism is something that's really exploded since 2014,
and it's done so in India, Brazil, the US, Europe. We'll see again the French elections now,
we saw in the European elections, we'll see the French elections. What's it really about?
It's about a style of saying the problem is that you've been betrayed by the elite,
and that there are these real people who I'm speaking for, I'm speaking for the people,
I'm speaking for the nation, if we just get rid of this horrible elite, we can bring kind of
authentic stuff that reflects our values, and we're going to challenge wokery, we're going to
challenge sloppy thinking, and we're going to sort it out. The trick of populism is that, of
course, there's always a kernel of truth in this, right? Because some of the criticisms I've just
made of the stuff I'm talking about with Syria and my civil society could be made by natural
forage. And of course, when he says, this government said they were going to cut immigration,
but they've actually just bought in 1.2 million more people, he's right. When Donald Trump says
this brilliant elite humiliated itself and America and Iraq and Afghanistan and these
things were completely catastrophic, disastrous, $3 trillion wars that killed a lot of people in
the G9, he's right. The problem, though, is that the solution that they pose does not respect the
root of law, does not respect our institutions, does not respect minority rights, is not about
compromise, is not about working together, it is polarizing, it's deceptive, it's aggressive,
and it's generally incompetent. Let's take some of those. You mentioned that it's
not respecting the rule of law and it's not respecting the rights of minorities. Can you
give some examples of those two things in a Western context? I'm sure we could find stuff in
Brazil or wherever. Yeah, so very simple examples. Boris Johnson, he's kind of muted populist,
but you can see the first elements there. He comes in, first thing he tries to do is try to lock
the doors on parliament to get his Brexit deal through, tries to paroch parliament. In the end,
and to do it, he lies to the Queen, he tries to use these kind of medieval laws to try to
drive it through, he's overruled by the Supreme Court. Now, traditionally, all primalists in
Britain would say huge respect for the Supreme Court, huge respect for the root of law, we're
backing off of this. He goes straight out there and says, the Supreme Court basically betraying
the people, I know whose side I'm on, I'm speaking for the people. Hold on, I don't want to go into
the weeds of these, but on that, first of all, I don't think anyone in the populist movements
would identify Boris Johnson as one of their own. I think he's just, we can agree he's a
duplicitous person politician, and we absolutely do on that. Also, the Supreme Court is actually a
very new thing in this country, so the idea that it's an ancient institution to which everybody
would bow down seems to me inaccurate. Well, let's take the two things. You're right, Supreme
Court's a new institution, it's predecessors, though, played the same role, so the Privy
Council and the House of Lords played the same role. Fundamentally, though, the question is,
when Johnson faces an obstacle, does he respect the sovereignty of parliament,
does he respect the root of law, or does he do what he actually did in parliament on that day,
which is say, I'm speaking for the people. And what does he mean by I'm speaking for people?
He means he's speaking for people who voted for Brexit, and probably not everybody who voted for
Brexit. So it's probably not even a majority of the people, but he says these are the real people,
and that the people who oppose him are enemies of the people. Now, maybe you're right that
Frasch wouldn't recognize him as a populist, but that is for me the essence of populism.
I guess the counterargument that I can conjure fairly easily in my head to what you're saying,
and I'd be curious to get your take on it, is I think if we look at across Europe,
and this is also increasingly true in the United States, even though their attitude to
immigration is very different to the European attitude, actually, I find that Americans are
much more pro almost unlimited legal immigration for historical, geographical reasons, etc. But
in Europe, what I think a lot of people would quite reasonably say is not only have we had
very high levels of legal immigration, which was not democratically, there was no mandate for the
levels of immigration we saw, more people came into this country under the Blair government,
then came into this country between 1066, the Battle of Hastings in 1950, the conservatives
come in, and they basically double down and have more immigration again. I take your point and
you're smiling because your argument might well be, well, that's what our economy needs. We can
park that for one second. In addition to that, we have increasingly high levels of illegal
immigration, for which there is no economic rationale. There is no reason that should be
happening. I'm a first generation immigrant to this country. I don't understand why it's happening.
I don't understand why tens of thousands of people come into this country on small boats every year.
The counterargument to what you're saying might be, well, if the elite are not doing the things
that they're either elected to do or the things which have any rationale for being done,
well, why wouldn't we vote for Nigel Farage? Yeah, well, that's exactly why he's...
But why is that wrong to do? That's what I'm...
Because as I was trying to say, the point is not, is Farage right in his criticisms? The point is,
what would he represent and what would he do if he was in government? As I say, a lot of
Donald Trump's criticisms are perfectly valid. But I hope you don't like the idea of Donald Trump
becoming president just because what he says about Iraq or Afghanistan happens to be true.
I don't think that's why people are voting for Donald Trump. I think the reason people are voting
for Donald Trump is they hope someone can deal with the problem of mass illegal immigration in
America. Yeah, so... And they believe that he's much more likely to do that than Donald Joe Biden
and he has. So I personally believe that the immigration problem is the thing that is undermining
centrist governments almost more than anything else. Yeah, what it is. And that it is ridiculous
of Britain and other European countries not to put the arrangements in place with third party
countries and not to challenge the completely broken concept of asylum, which we inherited
from the end of the Second World War. A much more sensible way of doing it would be to say,
we will accept a certain number of people as asylum seekers every year and we'll define that
number. So I would say 0.5% of your population a year you can take. And we will do it in a way
that prioritizes female judges from Afghanistan and people who are at direct risk of war in Somalia
and we will do it as a target that we sign up to along with Europe and the United States and
Canada. We'll all sign up to this. It would be a great help if places like Japan and China signed
up as well because they aren't taking anybody. Luxembourg is taking more people every year than
Japan. But at least the G7 could sign up to this. And if we manage to get that through,
then I think the corollary of that is, and we're not going to accept people who just happened to
get on a boat because the people who get on a boat are predominantly young men from low middle
class families who've managed to put together 10,000 or 20,000 euros in order to pay a
people's market. And there's absolutely no reason to be taking them for France. France is a safe
country and nobody has any reason to say I'm at stress in France and I'm going to be safe from
the United Kingdom. It's not a kind of definitional that whatever is driving them across the channel,
it's not persecution. And so I think liberals of that sort who seem to fantasize about open
borders and think that anybody are going down a very, very dangerous and misleading path.
It sounds to me like we agree entirely on all of that. That's what I would advocate for. And
all I'm saying is I think the reason that you're seeing people vote for people like Nigel Farage
and populist parties around Europe is no mainstream politician that I have heard
is been willing to make that argument and then deliver on it. We haven't had that position
be articulated in public and then be delivered on it. And we know over the next five years,
it's not going to happen either. Well, so to be fair to Rishi Sunak and the Conservative government,
I think that broadly is their position and they would like to get to that position.
But when they try to do it, what do you have? You have one solution, Rwanda and move people to
Rwanda. Seems fair enough. We can debate about whether Rwanda is the right place. But the basic
idea that you could move people to a safe country if the problem is they're being persecuted,
that isn't the United Kingdom, seems fine. There's an idea that Labour tried to have with France,
which is, okay, France, stop these people getting on boats. In return, we will take genuine asylum
seekers. We will share the burden with you of genuine asylum seekers turning up in France,
but we won't have these boats coming illegally. Where are they getting in trouble? They're getting
in trouble because they appear to be completely unable to coordinate with the French police.
Why are these 40,000 people coming? It's because of French police. We've never been able to work
out how to change the legal system. So at the moment, unless there's legal change, you arrive
and you can claim asylum. And because we don't know what to do about claims in European court of
human rights. And of course, people like me then, and this is the problem on the one hand, I absolutely
think this is ridiculous. These people shouldn't be coming here. They have no right to be here.
But if you then say to me, would you want to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights,
I think, well, what a second, this is a really important institution that was set up in the 1950s
by a Conservative government. It's done an enormous amount to help rights around Europe.
So how do I balance that against this? So I don't think it is that Rishi Sunak disagrees with you
or me on this. I think it's that, as with most of these things, when you try to do it,
you run into a lot of complications. I think we've just got to the core of our
disagreement, or the disagreement that a populist might have with your position, let's say,
which is that at the point where you go, well, I don't want to leave the ECHR because it's an
that's when the person says, well, in that case, F you, I'm voting for Faraj.
That's how you create populism. Sure, absolutely, absolutely. And of course,
that the question with any radical politician, you're called populist,
revolutionaries, progressives, radicals, maybe Jeremy Corbyn, it could be Nigel Faraj,
is sometimes it's true. Sometimes it's true that the whole system is so broken
that things that we venerate our constitution, the European Court of Human Rights may have
become such incredible obstacles to change that they need to be shattered.
But of course, as a conservative, I would say, be very careful doing that because this thing,
the European Court of Human Rights, you're focused on because it's stopping you
dealing with people arriving on boats. But you may not understand all the other things that it does
and all the other things that you lose when you shatter it. And that's the problem,
that the fundamental argument against any populist or revolutionary is an argument
of prudence. It's an argument to be thoughtful, be careful, think this thing through,
what are the unintended consequences, what you're doing, where does this go?
And that has to be balanced against perfectly valid human instinct, which is
we need to get on with things, we need to sort things out, screw that,
we're going to move fast, we're going to break things, which is to lose trust for you in the
world. And of course, when it works, you're the great reformer, you're Margaret Thatcher,
when it doesn't work, you'll lose trust. You're an affectless, impudent, foolish person who didn't
bother to take decent advice or your quasi-court saying, and you're glib. And you do stuff without
understanding the consequences. Rory, what argument, I would love to see what you think about this,
about populism is very necessary, a lot of people would argue, because it holds a major
parties to account. And the only way really to hold a major party like the conservatives to account
is to hit them where it hurts, which is them not getting reelected, them losing seats in parliament.
And reform, UKIP, is the most effective way of doing that democratically.
So what is populism and why is it a problem? One problem with it is that it is essentially
isolationist. All these populist movements involve retreating from the world. And this is really
the story that we've seen since 2014, and this is the story we'll see more of with Trump, with
Parash, that's populism has redefined the way the mainstream parties operate. So basically,
Biden's foreign policy is inherited from Trump. And to some extent, Obama's late policy was shaped
by this kind of complaint. So what does it mean? It means that America's put first, and we don't
get involved in it, well, we don't want to be a global policeman anymore. So that means Putin
invades Crimea, maybe he responds, Obama draws a red line in Syria, Bashar al-Assad breaks it,
he doesn't want to get involved. Biden withdraws all his troops from Afghanistan, the whole thing
collapses like a pack of cards. Trump threatens to withdraw from NATO. And almost certainly,
if he's elected, will allow a pro-Putin puppet government to be in Kiev.
And what's the result of that? Since 2014, every single year, we have seen more refugees,
more eternally displaced people, more civilians killed in conflict.
Second thing about populism. Populism is basically very, very well-disposed towards
strong men, authoritarian government, the model of government is the macho person
that sorts it out, right? They look envious at Singapore, Saudi Arabia, UAE, sometimes although
they don't admit it, they're tempted to think, oh, look at China, it's amazing, they build all
these trains and roads, it's wonderful, right? And that's why often populism is associated with what
we call democratic backsliding. So in Hungary and Poland, in India, Bangladesh, you begin
tamping shutting down opposition in media, shutting down the universities that criticize you,
pursuing the alternative political parties, taking them into the courts,
using the civil service against your opponents to assert yourself against your opposition.
And what's the result of that? Well, since 2014, the number of democracies in the world has begun
to fall dramatically. We just had an attempted coup yesterday. Six elected governments in Africa
that were pro-Restan have now fallen to military governments that are pro-Moscow.
That also is a consequence of populism. And the final thing, right? So isolation of foreign policy,
authoritarianism in domestic politics, and the final thing is economic.
Basically, these populists are protectionists. Trump has driven the move to put up massive
tariff barriers around the United States. Biden has responded by 105% tariffs on imported Chinese
vehicles. They're all pushing for industrial strategies. They're taking us back to the economics
of the 1970s. They're illiberal in every way. They're illiberal socially. They're also illiberal
economically. All the normal logic of economics that suggests that actually markets work better
than strongmen picking winners, that global free trade works better than protectionism is going
out the window. So this closing in economically, politically, internationally is a very dangerous
path for the world that will make the world more dangerous, less free and poorer.
So I guess my question is, what should somebody do who's going to vote when they look at the
options that are available to them, which it doesn't matter which country you're in,
they all seem weak to put it mildly? Well, I think one thing which is uncomfortable
is we need to be better at analyzing what the problem is. I mean, I'm often criticized because
this book Politics on the Edge provides a very negative picture of politics. And you know,
my friend Alistair will say how you're going to encourage anyone to vote or get involved in
politics if you make it out as being so grim. I think you've got to explain how grim it is.
The only way to reform politics or the NHS is to explain how screwed the systems. The only way
that we will generate reform and better politicians is by really explaining this uncomfortable
stuff. By doing so, you begin to give a bit of space, I hope, for the chance of changing
our electoral system, which I think would make a huge difference, changing the way that ministers
operate, changing the way that House of Lords operates, changing the way the media is owned
and managed, and structural changes which will make a healthier system where you're more likely
to get people that you'd want to vote for. I know exactly what you're saying, but that is a
very long, long, long-term project. And I know we've talked about the competency thing. I just
look at people like Keir Starmer, and it goes back to our earlier conversation, the unwillingness to
have uncomfortable conversations. And I look at Starmer, for example, and I do not see that. He
can't even say what a woman is, Rory. How is he going to have another type of uncomfortable
conversation? That shouldn't even be uncomfortable. Do you see why I'm despairing?
I can totally see why I'm despairing, but Starmer, why is he like that? Presumably not because he's
really like that. He's like that because that's the incentives that have been set up in the system.
He's always certainly going to win a majority of 300 seats on the back of what we call a Ming
Bar strategy, which is not answering any uncomfortable questions, not having any policy. He's
going to win a record-breaking, probably the largest majority ever achieved in British history by
saying nothing. So if that's the case, the question is, what's going on here? Is it that he's a
particularly incompetent weak individual, or is it that he just understands how our culture works,
how our media works, how our voters work, how we think, and has worked out that we
don't like uncomfortable conversations? Well, we like them on the show, which is why
it's been great having you on, Rory. We're going to go to questions from our audience in a second,
but as you know, before we let you go, the thing that we always ask at the end is, what's the
one thing we're not talking about as a society that we really should be? Before Rory answers a
final question, at the end of the interview, make sure to head over to our locals. The link is in
the description where you'll be able to see this. Does Rory see conservatism in the current Tory party?
I spent 15 years working on the Middle East and Asia, I wrote three books on Asia,
I spoke three Asian languages, I made the Africa Minister, I don't know anything about Africa.
Rory, what haven't we asked you that we should have done?
We're not talking about knowledge and ignorance. We're not talking about
the fact that at the heart of many of these conversations is the fact that we are drowned
in information, that we can't begin to make sense of things. I gave the tiny example of
what would happen if you were made Secretary of State for Health tomorrow and you suddenly had to
get your head around 1.1 million staff, 335 million GP appointments. Goodness knows how many
hours. We pretend that we're in a world of knowledge management. We pretend that the difference
between good and bad results is how much you know. In truth, we live in a world so overwhelmed by
knowledge that in fact we're in the dark, that a lot of what we're talking about is risk, uncertainty,
hunches. Nobody really knows what's going on. One of the reasons why markets work is that they
don't depend on people in the center knowing stuff. They're about the way in which prices
communicate, tacit information, tacit preferences allow a complicated society to operate without
having to rely on the notion of the Superman. I think this notion of the Superman, this notion
of the kind of all-knowing or all-powerful leader is at the heart of most of our problems because
such people don't exist and those people who claim to be such are frauds.
