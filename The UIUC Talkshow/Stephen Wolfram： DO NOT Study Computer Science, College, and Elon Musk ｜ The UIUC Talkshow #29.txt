Welcome to the UOUC talk show.
Our goal of this show is to introduce you to the most interesting people with the most
interesting ideas.
Today we have a very special guest, Dr. Wolfram, which I would describe as someone who is saying
in a way most people are crazy.
Okay.
That's interesting.
Thank you.
That could be a positive thing to say or it could be a negative thing to say.
We'll find out.
Go for it.
I think it's a very positive thing.
It's something that I admire.
But I want to focus the conversation and the first question is that if you were in college
today, what would you major be?
Would you even go to college?
It's an interesting question.
First question is what would I be studying or interested in?
I grew up in England and I was a kid in the 1960s and so on when space was the big thing.
As it was then, as it perhaps is again now, with a 50-year gap.
I followed all the various spacecraft and things like that.
I was interested in that partly because it seemed like the future and I was interested
in the future.
Interesting that then from that I got interested in physics and studied physics as much as
I could when I was like 10, 11, 12 years old.
Ironically, a project that I got interested in when I was 12 years old about the second
war of thermodynamics.
I'm finally finishing that project now, 50 years later.
That's a funny thing.
But anyway, separate topic.
I got interested in physics.
So happened that in the mid-1970s was kind of a golden age for physics and so it was
a time when quantum field theory was really discovering all kinds of things, all kinds
of experimental results were coming in.
It was super exciting field.
For me, that was sort of the obvious field to work on because it was the exciting field
of the time.
What you generally see in kind of the rhythm of how things work is some methodological
advances made.
Maybe it's an experimental thing, maybe it's a methodological thing, maybe it's a theoretical
thing and then some field gets really exciting for five or 10 years because there's lots
of low-hanging fruit to be picked.
That meant that when I was a mid-teenager or something, I could discover a bunch of
things in physics which people still care about today because it happened to be a time
when there was juicy low-hanging fruit to pick.
So the fact that I was doing physics was a consequence in large part of the fact that
it was a hot thing at that time.
And so when I, well, I went to college kind of early and I was sort of, see the problem
is that when you ask a question like what would I major in college in today depends
on whether it was the same me with the same kinds of constraints, whether it's kind of
a different, a me that might have arisen in modern times where different things are
the exciting things.
I mean, in the last few years, I mean, I get to see this from our summer camp and summer
school and so on.
Students come in every year and they're always like, we want to study this kind of thing
where this is the popular thing of the time.
So it had been, there was a brief period when it was blockchain, I think that one died too
quickly because I think that one actually has an interesting tale.
When there's been a longer period when it's machine learning, it really wants to do machine
learning.
That one, I think that wave is very crested at this point.
And then it's the question, so if you say what would I study today, an awful lot of
people go and study computer science in college.
And this I think is not really the right thing because what is the thing that we realize
is computation and computational X is the big sort of paradigmatic thing about time.
And that's all these different fields, X for archaeology, zoology, whatever it is.
There's a computational version of those fields that is going to be the future of those fields
and that's the thing people should want to study because there's going to be low hanging
fruit to pick and it's really an exciting thing to do.
But then people say, okay, I'm going to do, I really, I'm not sure they say it properly,
but what they should be saying is I want to do computational X.
What do I need to do to get to being able to do computational X?
Well, they sort of say that implicitly and then they say, well, I better study computer
science in college, which I think is crazy.
And I think because if you look at what is, I mean, computer science departments that have
sort of a complicated story of what they actually teach and a lot of it ends up being, this
is how to program in low level languages, which I don't know whether anybody's going
to care about in the future.
I mean, it's, you know, when I was, when I first learned about computers, when I first
used a computer back in 1973, I programmed it in assembly language.
And when I built my first big computer system in 1979, was built in the C programming language,
which was at that time kind of a new fangled thing to use.
And people were still saying, oh, anything really serious, you have to build it in assembly
language.
And, you know, turns out nobody says that anymore, because that, you know, we automated
those layers.
And so it isn't useful to, you know, hand program things in assembly language.
And I think, you know, the thing that I've spent a large part of my life doing is trying
to build sort of a higher level way of thinking about computation that doesn't require you
to sort of be in the guts of the machine, you know, programming the loop and saying this
thing should be stored in memory in this place and so on.
That is not something humans need to do, just as humans don't need to write assembly language.
And, you know, a large part of my life has been devoted to kind of building up this computational
language that gets one away from that.
And I think in terms of sort of the path of how do you get to computational X without
going through sort of traditional computer science, this is a path that, you know, I've
spent a lot of effort trying to enable.
But how does that relate to kind of what people should study in college?
You know, if you study computer science, a large part of what you're studying is a bunch
of the past.
You're studying a bunch of, you know, how to deal with computers at a lower level.
Actually, I think they stopped teaching assembly language, which is kind of a shame.
But it's kind of a sign because it's kind of like, well, there are these layers and,
you know, the more and more gets automated, less and less is worth learning that way.
So people, you know, now in terms of computer science as a field that colleges teach has
various kinds of sort of application areas that have been bolted on to computer science
as such, different ones in different schools, because they don't fit in any other department.
And that's sort of random.
And if one of the, you know, robotics is one that's often bolted on, computer security,
cryptography, another bolt on, machine learning is a sort of bolt on, but it's like, what
other department does it fit in, even though the methods are much more like physics and
things like that.
It's all statistics.
So you know, it's complicated.
So gosh, what, this is a, this is a complicated answer, isn't it?
I think the, you know, if I look at, I mean, it also depends on, okay, there's another
point, which is when I was a kid, I made this sort of meta discovery that you could learn
things just by reading books, which was, it's, that's all gotten a lot easier because it's
a lot easier to read things, you know, to learn things by looking at things on the internet
than it is by bicycling to the, you know, to the local library and finding a book.
So you know, some people like myself, for example, have a certain pattern of learning
that is pretty good to teach yourself.
I mean, for me, I can't learn stuff sort of cold in the abstract, but when I have some
project I want to do, then I go learn a bunch of stuff, and then I get motivated to do it
and so on.
That's my way of doing things.
That has little relationship to what the mode of learning that one gets in college.
If for people who are in that sort of autodidact, you know, learn it for yourself type thing,
I don't know whether a college is, you know, the benefits of it are not so clear.
I think there are plenty of people for whom the things, you know, the methods of learning
things that I've used just don't work, and they're not a good fit for personality or
whatever, and then, you know, college is a fine thing.
Now, in terms of what subjects one studies in college, I mean, it depends what one wants
to do.
I think that the traditional export fields, that is, if you study this field, you can
go and do all kinds of stuff.
The winner historically has been physics.
You know, that's been the one where if you look at sort of the life stories of people
who've gone on and, you know, started molecular biology or started, you know, bunch of areas
of computer science or whatever else, they studied physics.
That's been, why is that?
I think it's because it's a quantitative field that has definite things, but it is not
as kind of detailed as mathematics and not as kind of, not as sort of formalistic as
mathematics.
It's more practical.
It's like there's quantitative things, but you can study all kinds of stuff with them.
Now, the details of studying particular areas of physics, I'm not sure how useful that is,
but the general methodology has turned out to be a good export field.
I think the other export fields that in, you know, I think computer science is a little
bit of an export field and has become in some places as becoming more of an export field.
There are fields that, you know, if well-taught are good export fields, like philosophy, if
well-taught is a good export field for lots of kinds of things.
I think for some areas, economics and certain kinds of teaching is probably a reasonable
export field, but you don't see, you know, so that's one, you know, one consideration.
But I think in, you know, so the next question is, should you go to college at all, right?
And the answer is, if you want to do software engineering, techy stuff, I don't think going
to college is, you know, it's not, it depends on, it may be a life stage type thing that's
worth going to college for that, you know, having that experience in life, so to speak.
But in terms of, does it teach you to be a better programmer?
I don't know.
I know plenty of programmers who never went to college or went to college and studied
something that had nothing to do with programming, you know, never did a computer science course,
and they are better programmers than the people.
In fact, it's usually, honestly, it's a little bit of a bad sign sometimes when people say,
I went, I studied computer science, I did my four years, and now I'm a programmer.
It's like, well, actually, you know, many of the most sort of natural and talented programmers,
you know, don't need to go through programming school, so to speak.
So I think that's, you know, and I've seen, you know, we've had a bunch of people at this
company, for example, who have come to work here, you know, without going to college,
going to, you know, some small amount of college and so on, and often very successful.
And actually, one of the things that's ironic is that often those people have broader interests
and knowledge than the people who've gone through the super fancy educational process.
And, you know, the people who've got PhDs and so on, some of them have broad interests,
and particularly the ones who end up working at this company.
But the, you know, sometimes it's like, I studied this for my PhD for six years, and
now I'm, that's what I do.
And that's the only thing I know about and care about.
And so that's a very long answer to what might have been a simple question.
And I think the, I think probably the answer is it really depends a lot on the person,
how they learn things, and what they're actually interested in.
Which, you know, you unfortunately find an awful lot of kids these days who've gone
through school, they've done really well, and they say, you say, what are you interested
in? I don't know, I don't really know what I'm interested in.
And then they'll go through college, and they'll do well in college, and they'll get to the
end, and they'll say, what am I going to do next?
And maybe they'll go to graduate school, or maybe they'll go to the career fair, and
they'll see, you know, who has the best candy, and then they'll be working for, you know,
big company X. And then, you know, maybe they'll wake up a few decades later and say, oh,
maybe I should have done something different.
But that's, you know, I think it's always great when people have sort of things that
they realize they're interested in. Sometimes people have things that they're interested
in, and they're like, how could I make a living doing this thing?
There's something they're interested in, but it's like they don't know how to get there
from here, so to speak. I think the thing to say is, particularly for people who are
young in modern times and so on, it's, you know, with creativity, it's possible to make
a living doing all kinds of things. I mean, who knew you could make a living, you know,
professionally playing video games, or, you know, being a YouTube influencer, talking
about this or that. It's, I mean, there's a certain, it requires a certain tenacity and
a certain kind of entrepreneurial spirit to get those kinds of things to work. But it
isn't the case that people should just say, well, I am interested in this, but I can't
do that because, you know, I'll never be able to get a job doing that. I can't learn that
in school. I'm going to do these standard things. And, you know, I think that's a shame
because I think people can, you know, with creativity, it's often possible to find those
things. I mean, you could be unlucky and you could have a thing you're really interested
in that at this time in history just isn't possible. Or just isn't, you know, you could
be interested in discovering the source of the Nile or something. But sorry, that's what,
that's what's been done. Or you could be interested in, you know, taking a trip to a different
star system. Well, sorry, it's too early to do that. But usually there are, you know,
I think it's with a little bit of creativity, there are, you know, that's the problem to
solve, so to speak. And I think that should inform what people study in college. Another
thing I might comment about college, I'll make two, since you asked me about college
and since some, you know, first point is that in, in almost any large college, there are
all kinds of interesting things to find to do. Point one, point two, you know, there are
professors at colleges. And one of the things, at least the brief time when I was a professor,
one of the things that kind of shocked me is students never come to talk to you. And turns
out, maybe, maybe I was too horrifying a professor, I don't know. But it, you know,
students don't make use of, in many cases, the ability, you know, professors, you know, some
of them may have a bad day, or maybe, you know, maybe otherwise, maybe jerks, who knows. But,
but most of the time, you know, a student comes in, has an interesting question, professor is
going to be pleased, you know, a student gets all kinds of useful interaction. I think that's
one thing that, that another thing is, you know, taking random courses about things that you'll
never otherwise learn about in your life is a good strategy. Because, you know, if you take that
one course about this or that, I mean, a famous sort of pseudo historical example, is, you know,
Steve Jobs with his calligraphy course, so to speak, you know, that, which that story has some
embellishment to it. But that's the, it works. Yeah, right. I think, you know, this, this point of
there are things to learn in college that you'll never, you know, you'll never get around to
learning any other time in life, probably. I mean, I've been lucky enough that I've done all kinds
of different projects and all kinds of different things. And so I have gradually learned all kinds
of stuff about all kinds of different areas. I mean, it helps that my main life goal has been
building this computational language that makes everything computable, so to speak, which means
that I kind of have a driver for learning about everything, so to speak. But that's, you know,
that that's an unusual case. Anyway, very long answer to a what seemed like a simple question.
Yeah, and I think that there's something very interesting about this idea that you can go
through school and you can come out of and you don't know what you're interested in. And I think
for me, college has been a place where I stopped caring so much about, you know, what shooting
like, what is the college telling you what you should do and more about what are the hypotheses
I could create and test out to see what I actually like. So I, you know, random class, I was thinking
our history, I've taken, I don't stand up comedy completely unprepared from 300 people, just to
see and test out a lot of hypotheses and see what I'm actually interested in, which you can come
out of the other side. It is so sad. Like, you know, what do you want to do with your life? Oh, I
want to work at x company because you know, I'm doing computer science, you know, it's for the
money, right, type of thing. And, you know, that's another good point that you said, like, a lot
of people are doing computer science. And in a way, you know, that's kind of the only major that
has some sort of demand for for jobs. And so a lot of people are doing that for the money and so
on. And it's really sad to see that and not doing what you love doing.
Well, it depends on what, you know, the problem is there is a whole lot of kind of drone computer
science out there. That is, you know, you get, you know, you do all this stuff, you study all
these things. And then you're optimizing a piece of JavaScript code for the next, you know, have a
long. And that's, you know, that's kind of a, it seems pretty boring to me. I mean, there are
people for whom that really is interesting. And that's fine. But if you look at their trajectory
in school, it's often doing things which are much more sort of intellectually kind of rich than
that. You know, I think this, you know, this question of sort of what people do, well, you know,
an awful lot of the sort of high end fancy kids go into finance kinds of areas, which is, you
know, which I don't know, I have many friends in those areas, the people in those areas use our
technology a lot. So that's nice. But it is a weird thing in the world that I mean, it is true
that if you want to make money, being close to the money is kind of a, you know, a good strategy,
so to speak. It's, if you want to make, you know, and I think it is, it is a little bit shocking
that the fraction of code of sort of the very high end, very successful students who go into that
kind of area, I think it's been somewhat cyclical. But and by the way, you know, in computer
science, you know, I don't know, you have to pick your area, if you get into an area that
happens to be a low supply, high demand, at the time when you are in, you are the first machine
learning engineer, you're the first person who knows, you know, how to do containerization,
you're the first person who knows this or that. That's, you know, that's a pretty good deal. And
it's also more interesting, probably, than being the, you know, 25,000th person who knows about
this or that thing. What it takes to be the first person who knows about one of these things,
well, there probably isn't a class in your university about that thing, because none of the
professors know about it yet. So, you know, so that means, you know, how do you get to that point?
And, you know, is it useful to have that base of, I mean, again, the thing that my impression is
that an awful lot of what gets taught in computer science, you know, in colleges, not, not all,
but a lot is kind of how to program, which is, it's kind of a trade. It's kind of a, you know,
it's a trade like carpentry, like lots of other things. It's a pretty rich and complicated trade,
but it's basically a thing where you learn it by doing it. And you can do that by, you know, by
doing it in a class, or you can write pieces of code for yourself, or you can, you know, work at
a company and gradually get better and better at writing, writing things. And it's not clear. I
mean, I don't know, it's like, you mentioned stand up comedy. I'm curious whether being a good
stand up comic is something that is actually, you know, if you take somebody who was hadn't, you
know, was, had never, you know, was didn't have sort of any intrinsic talent in this area, and you
run them through these courses, you run them through enough courses, what do you get at the end
of it, so to speak? You know, it's I'm skeptical. You know, I think it's one of these things where
you're either going to have sort of the spark that makes that really be a thing that you're going
to be into. Maybe it takes you a while to discover how to use that spark. I mean, this is a thing
when people do, I don't know, well, lots of kinds of things, but, you know, something like
management or entrepreneurism, you know, there are many, many, many different ways to do it.
That's suitable for many different personalities. And, you know, you can be like, I need to be a
this kind of entrepreneur, this kind of manager. And sorry, it's just not your personality. It's
not going to work very well. But if you can figure out, oh, you know, I can run this kind of company
or whatever, and you figure out what that is, then it takes off and it's wonderful. And I think I
think the same is true with a bunch of them. Look, it's true with these, you know, I think these
things where somebody says, I really don't get computers, but I'm going to study computer science.
And eventually, after four years, I'm going to, you know, be able to write Java code or whatever.
I don't think that's going to end that well. I don't think that's a, I don't think it'll be a,
you know, a fulfilling result. And it's better to, you know, to find something you actually
really like to do. And sometimes the problem is that what you learn about in school is a small
fraction of what's out there in the world. And, you know, you don't, you know, you go
good exercise, look at an encyclopedia or something, and say, you know, pick a random article.
Is this something they teach in school? The answer is maybe 20% of the time,
maybe a little bit more than that. But there's an awful lot of stuff that happens in the world
that is not what you get taught in school. And sometimes also confusing, like the things you
get taught in school, like math or something, the low level versions of what you learn there
are really different from if you're going to be a math researcher or something. It really isn't
much like doing arithmetic problems. And, you know, and sometimes people, like in math, for
example, they'll say, I really like math in school. What do you like about it? Do you like
problem solving? Do you like sort of definitive competition? Do you like having a subject where
there's a right answer? Do you like something about kind of the formal elegance of the whole thing?
If you can kind of figure out which of those pieces, then there are all kinds of different,
you know, directions based on those pieces. But just knowing, you know, it's like,
I'm doing math. I want to go on doing math or whatever. It doesn't even stay the same thing,
because, you know, what it turns into in terms of research is very different. I mean, you know,
the thing to realize is the people who succeed in doing research at a sort of high level,
the number one attribute is sort of the strategy of what you study. It is not the mechanics of how
you study it. There are many people who can get through the mechanics of how to study it.
The question is, you know, the question is more what question you're going to ask,
than can you answer the question that has been asked, so to speak, which is really different
from what happens in, you know, in school, where you're fed questions that you didn't make up.
Right.
And, you know, so that's, right, I think, anyway, yes.
Right. So like, it's important to like stumble upon the problem rather than someone
feeding you a problem. And then because I think, like, I agree with you, like, it's much better to
like find something that you want to work on rather than someone telling you, okay,
write this piece of code or write this program, which does this for me. Because if it's something
that you actually come up with, you will be more inclined to learn more about it and all the
everything around it to like, that's an idea like we have been talking about for a while now,
which is project based learning. Like we were thinking how, how can we ask important questions
and how can we change the institutions that exist today, like what needs to change,
so that the people who are a part of this institution can think more broadly, more deeply
about the world that they're living in. Right. And what we thought was the like common denominator
in all of this was that if, if you come in or if you, if you have the right atmosphere, we can
explore and find a project that you want to work on. And if you're given the resources
to work on it, like this university, for example, right, we have so many wonderful, like,
brilliant people on the same campus in such close proximity. But like you mentioned,
students, once you're in a university, you don't really interact with these professors.
There's like, there's like a sort of disconnect you learn from them, sure, in classes, but there's
no, there's nothing beyond that. Just go knock on their door. Right. It's, it's, it's a good strategy.
Exactly. It's, maybe I'll get complaint emails from people saying, you said all these students
know, but professors, at least when I was in that business, even though I really wasn't
that interested in being a professor, you know, it was interesting when I would talk to students
and one of the things that often surprised me, I mean, as a professor for a little while at
University of Illinois, and one of the things that, you know, occasionally students would come
and see me. And, you know, the first thing I would ask them is, so what are you interested in?
So we'd have a discussion about that. And they'd say, that was a very useful discussion. Nobody
ever asked me that before. It's, so, you know, I think that was, but, but no, to your point about,
about, you know, what you study. And, you know, there are people like me, for example, who are
very motivated by things that they, you know, by questions that they're interested in answering.
There are other people for whom that's a less important thing. And I think the other thing
that I've noticed is, you know, sometimes I am confronted with things which, frankly, at the
beginning seem really tedious and boring. And, you know, the engineering problems that we have to
solve or whatever else. And it's like, you know, this is going to be really dull. I get into it.
And what I've discovered is that if you do basically almost any problem in an intellectual,
sort of deep way, it will turn out to be interesting. And, you know, there is a way to do it.
That will be quite boring, where you are just sort of skating across it
to try and get to the other side. Maybe you'll succeed in getting to the other side. Maybe you
won't. Maybe you'll fall into the ice or whatever. But the, you know, when, if you choose to think
about these things, you choose to say, what's the real problem? What is the intellectual
underpinning of what's going on? Let me really think about that. Even things which at the beginning
were like, that sounds really pretty dull, turn out to be quite interesting. And I'm sure that's
true. Now, you know, a lot of students get into the situation, but they're so busy. It's like,
I've got to, you know, send, you know, write in this paper, do this, whatever it is, that they,
they can never do more than skate, because they have so much to do. And I think that's an unfortunate
feature of, I think, I don't know whether how much that's true in the college experience at
University of Illinois, for example, certainly in the sort of elite high school experience,
that does seem to be a terrible problem that people are just like, like they can't really
do anything for more than five minutes, so to speak, because they're, you know, it's just,
there's so much to do. But yes, I think, I mean, look, this whole thing about people actually
thinking is a, is an interesting issue. And it's something where for a lot of education,
ends up getting very industrial, and ends up being, can you do this process? You know,
do this thing, do this thing, do this thing, there isn't really much thinking involved. I remember
when I was a professor at University of Illinois, briefly, I, I ended up, was the last class I
ever taught was, was about physics for non scientists. Okay. And I thought this would be
kind of fun, because you get to talk about all kinds of sort of conceptual things, and there
were a bunch of students in the class, and turned out some sort of local folks from around town
started showing up and being in the back. So that was a sign that at least somebody was finding it
interesting. But the, I remember that the very, the first question on the first homework for that
class was, estimate the number of years of corn in a typical cornfield. Okay. And this produced
kind of a, almost a, you know, a riot for the students, they're like, how are we supposed to do
this? You know, it's like, do you know how to multiply? You know, you know, you know, you've
seen cornfields, there are lots of them around here. You know, do you look at the corn plants,
how far apart are they? You know, you can figure this out. It just requires thinking,
and it doesn't require any kind of thinking that is beyond what, you know, college sophomores or
whatever they were, you know, should be capable of, it doesn't require fancy, you know, knowledge of
physics or anything like that. It's kind of common sense thinking that, and it was interesting that
people, I was kind of shocking to me how, and this is now what, 1986 or something, so a while ago,
the was a little bit shocking to me how much people were like, we're not supposed to think,
we're just supposed to be fed, you know, this is these are the ingredients now run it through the
machine and get out the results. So yes, I think that, you know, this challenge of how do you get,
how do you encourage people to think? First step is to let them know that it's sort of okay to
actually think, which is not always the case that people communicate that because a lot of classes,
it's kind of like, you're putting two and two together, you're getting four, that's all we do
in this class. And, you know, if you think more broadly, oh, well, you know, if you write an essay,
that is not what the teacher thought it was going to be, you'll get a bad grade.
Right, you get PLI for doing something that's not what you're supposed to do.
Right, well, right, and I think that that is, so, you know, how does one avoid that? Well,
you know, the thing that I think is a bit odd sometimes is that, you know, many, many friends
who are professors and they, you know, at least people, you know, my friends are usually, they're
interested in things which aren't the I already knew that type of thing. It's like, many years ago,
I had a friend, a well-known physicist named Dick Feynman, who was, who had the following
principle about graduate students, okay, said if somebody came to, you know, wanted to work with
him, and they wanted to work with him on some project that he knew absolutely nothing about,
then he would do it. But as soon as it was something that he was kind of like, oh,
I already know about this and so on, you know, he wasn't interested. Now, he did pass on to me
various kinds of tidbits of, like, he was not that enthusiastic about that. I think one of his tidbits
was, you know, a thesis is a project done by the advisor under adverse conditions,
by which he meant that, I think a bad management in his part, but anyway, the, you know,
student would come in, would talk about some problem, you know, the advisor would say, oh,
you should do this and this and this. Student would go away for two or three weeks, come back,
the advisor has now forgotten what they figured out, and the student has come back and hasn't
made progress. Now, honestly, to me, having managed people and projects for a long time,
that's not what should happen. If you do it correctly and you give the right input to somebody,
they should be able to come back two weeks later and have actually achieved something.
If you give them a bunch of input, which they don't understand, then that's not going to work.
But, you know, it's part of the responsibility of the, you know, teacher or whatever, or manager
to sort of do things which are going to be possible for that person. I mean, you know,
one of the general problems of management, which I suppose I've spent more of my life doing than
professoring, is kind of, you know, you have to figure out, you've got these people, you've got
these projects, and the people have certain capabilities, the projects of certain needs.
How do you fit these together? If you try and sort of force fit it and just say, okay,
this person, just do this project, even though it's completely the wrong project for you,
it's not going to work. And so, you know, that's the, you know, that's the responsibility there.
And I think in terms of professors and so on, if they can figure out, you know, enough about
what's going on with the student to be able to say, hey, this is a good project, you know,
then they can really help. And, you know, I don't know, we've been doing this summer school for
college students, graduate students and so on for the last, gosh, how long is it, 20 years now.
And this is my, you know, now that I'm not a professor, this is my moment each year of
sort of extreme professoring, because, you know, three week thing, and I get to basically make
up projects for 75 people or something. And that it's an interesting process, because I've
gradually over the years, I've gotten a little bit better at doing it. It's really satisfying
when you make up a project, and you discover that the person turned that into a whole sort of career
starter, and sometimes even almost career. And that was, you know, it's like, okay, that was a
good, you know, that was worthwhile. And I think, but that's a, this problem of how do you match
a project to the student is an interesting problem. And people, you know, as I said,
we learned more over the years how to do that. I mean, what tends to happen, sometimes in colleges,
graduate school, things like that, is an advisor will have some definite research program. And
it's like, okay, you plug in here, which can be okay. Particularly if you, as the student,
pick that advisor well, and pick a project where you're like, I'm going to fit into this part,
and I really care about this project, then, you know, that's a thing that that can work well.
I can also end up that, you know, in some areas, like life science is one, but this happens a lot,
you know, you're, you're just pipetting things. And you're not really, you're part of some big
machine. And you don't really have a lot of sort of self determination about what's going on.
And, you know, I think, I think the other challenges for the student's point of view,
you can say to some professor, I want to study this. And that professor is the person who's
supposed to be teaching you whatever problem is the professor doesn't know about that, or they
don't care about it. And so, you know, again, you have the flip side of the problem, the professor
feeds the student something the student isn't, you know, isn't very suitable for them, is the
student can end up, you know, asking the professor to do something that is just not in the wheelhouse
of that particular professor. And so that's again, you know, the more you can study what a professor,
you know, knows about and cares about, and the more you can show up, you know, when you knock on
the door and ask a question, that is really, you know, something that that professor is going to
find interesting, you know, because you study what they're doing. And so you can say, well,
there's this thing, what about that? But I mean, this whole point about, you know, how do you
teach people to think it's a it's a fascinating problem. It has not helped the larger and sort
of more industrial educational institutions get the more difficult it is to make that happen.
Because if you've got, you know, 1000 students, you've got to get through this this program,
it's much more challenging to say, and each one is going to do some personalized thing.
That's, you know, it's not really a thing that is easy to achieve. And I think so, you know,
again, it becomes partly a, you know, doing projects that you're excited about is a way
that you will think about things that you kind of care about. It, you know, sometimes you may get
stuck. And then you have to try and figure out, you know, is there is there a person you can go
talk to to get unstuck who won't just tell you that's a stupid project, or won't give you a
bunch of stuff where you say, I don't understand any of that. And then you just get sort of
dispirited and say, I can't possibly do this project. You know, that's that's a another challenge.
But, you know, I think it's one of these things where people, there's both things that could be
done sort of on the on the professoring side. And there's things students can do to make kind of
them have a better experience in this, you know, given given what the machine is,
you know, the student can sort of figure out more about that machine to optimize their experience
in it. And I think that that like that ability to, you know, and, you know, I think a lot about
this question of, like, why are people in that way? And in a term, I kind of use it's an NPC,
which stands for non player character, which is from a video game, which is this thing,
it's kind of a funny way to think about this problem, which is, you know, people do not seem
to be thinking for themselves. And then you just kind of, you know, mob mentality type of that
type of thing. And, you know, how I think about it is that, you know, perhaps if you start doing
this type of projects more in public and sharing it and inviting people to work with you, you can
actually kind of show them that it's actually it's okay to do these type of things and it is possible.
Yeah, I mean, look, you know, one of the things I've often done, like at our summer school,
we usually start off with, I do some live computer experiment. Okay. One feature of live
computer experiments is, you know, I've been doing them for years, I'm pretty good at them.
But you're going to discover something, you're going to work on something you've never seen
before. So things are going to go wrong. And, you know, usually, my observation is about the
two thirds point, things look, it looks like all is lost. And, you know, typically, and, you know,
we're not going to be able to figure out anything. What's interesting about that process is you get
to see both, you know, the fact that, I don't know, somebody like me who's been doing this stuff
a long time, it's still not, you know, you don't just do it, do it, do it, and it all just works.
It's like things go wrong. It's point one. Point two is the thing you thought you were going for
at the beginning. Another thing that maybe is a useful thing to emphasize there is that at the
beginning, one sets the strategy, we're trying to do this. And here's why it's interesting.
Then you get into it. Then you realize, gosh, the thing we were trying to do,
I think you realize there's this other thing over here that we just discovered
that's actually more interesting than the thing we thought we were going to look at.
So, you know, we should kind of, you know, pivot what we're doing to look at that instead. And
that's, you know, the idea that, you know, you're kind of locked in, oh, I meant to do this, somebody
told me to do this. And, you know, even though something more interesting showed up here,
we can't go chase that. But anyway, I think that's an example of something that, you know,
doing that kind of thing, I don't think that many professors, for example, I don't know anybody who
does that. I mean, I think it's a totally scary thing to do if you are not fairly confident
and don't really care if the whole thing blows up, so to speak. I mean, I've also done,
I do a lot of live streaming of a couple of different kinds. I mean, one is several different
kinds, actually. But one of them is, you know, software design stuff, where it's just like the
actual raw, these are our working meetings, we're going to live stream them. Why not? They're interesting.
We get good feedback in real time, which is helpful. And sometimes people will suggest
things that are useful, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it's, you know, it's a thing where
that is a place where you can see hundreds of hours now, probably 500 hours, maybe more, maybe
a thousand hours, I can't remember. But of actual, you know, figuring stuff out, and you can see the
results because there are things that wind up in Wolfram language, you know, in the next version
of Wolfram language, this function that you can see there, four hours of discussion about this
thing, and then this is how it got resolved. And that's a place where, you know, there's definitely
thinking is visible, so to speak. I mean, this is a thing that happens in the concept that thinking
should be done invisibly is a strange concept. But, you know, most university teaching, that's
how it works, because the professor will present something. It's not like they're figuring something
out in real time. It's just like, let me tell you about this thing. And I think that's, yeah,
I mean, another live stream thing that I've been doing is sort of live stream Q&As about science,
about history, about other things. It's very educational for me. I hope it's educational
for the people who watch it, but it's educational for me because it, you know, it causes me to think
about things that, you know, if somebody asks me some question about something, usually the worst,
the questions where I say, that's a physics question, I know the answer cold. And then I get
into actually answering it. And I realize, oh my gosh, there's this thing that I've known since
I was, you know, 10 years old, but it's not actually obvious. And you have to explain it. And, well,
I'm not sure I can explain that that easily. It takes me a bit of thought to see how to explain
it. But, you know, I think that there are these things where, you know, this problem, okay,
so a lot of people, a lot of educational settings, there's a certain, this is a process you go through
to solve this type of problem. And, you know, if you learn that process, you will get a good
grade, and then you'll go on and be able to do all these other things. You know, to me, that's,
you know, that's fairly, in some sense, by the time it's that proceduralized, it will be automated
in time. And the thing that's most interesting to do as a human is things that are more kind of
judgment oriented, and more kind of involved with thinking. I mean, I think that,
you know, I don't, you know, this question of how do you, you know, how do you teach people to
think? Interesting question. It is not the problem that is being solved by most of education.
And it, you know, and again, and the machinery of education is not particularly well set up for
that, because it's quite industrial with lots of people going through it, and lots of kinds of,
you know, assessment mechanisms and so on. Very standardized in a way. Right. But I mean, it's,
but then from the point of view of the student, it's kind of up to you to kind of learn to think,
so to speak. I don't think, you know, there are situations that can be more helpful and less.
I mean, I like to believe that some of the educational stuff we do with summer school,
summer camp, some things that I do myself and so on, are helpful in this regard, particularly
in the, okay, so there's a point people don't realize, perhaps a couple of points. I mean,
one point is, you know, you're given a question, okay, you know, if you know a bunch of stuff,
you will be able to engage somehow to think about that question, even though there is,
you know, the answer is not in the back of the book, there isn't a book, you know, but actually
almost any question you can think about. And one of the things I've noticed, and it's true very
much with people in a sort of work setting, is do people keep the thinking apparatus engaged
when they are presented with different kinds of things to do? People find that surprisingly
difficult often. There are people who manage to do it, and that's great. And there are people,
well, it's like, well, how does it fit into this class that I took? How does it fit into whatever?
Well, actually, you know, you really do know how to think more broadly, but for some reason,
you disengage the thinking apparatus. So for example, one place where one sees that quite a bit
is, you know, let's say academics going into business, okay, where they're pretty analytical
and smart, and they figure out lots of things. And then they're presented with some situation with
people, business, organization, and so on. And they just like, they just, the thinking apparatus
disengages. It's like, look, you know, you've got this problem, you know how to think analytically
about things, you can figure it out. But it's like, they don't understand that they can take
the kind of the thinking that they know how to do in some technical field, and apply the same
underlying processes in some sense, to something completely different. Another thing that I noticed
with students, okay, pet peeve, right, so they, you know, students will study this in class A.
Okay, then you got sort of thing you're talking to them about whatever. And it's like, you say,
well, do you know anything about this? Well, yes, I took a class about this. Okay, well, so you can
apply a bunch of the ideas from that field or whatever it is to this thing that's come up. Oh,
they say, I can think of that. And often they really find it very difficult to, to take, you know,
even though they spent a year studying whatever it is, it's like, look, you know,
leverage what you learned there, you know, relate it to what you now have to think about.
This is a, you know, it's a thing one can do, so to speak, but people find that really difficult.
And even, even the transference from one class, you know, I learned about this in this class.
I mean, it's something, you know, because people use Mathematica, or from Alpha, or from language,
and so on, a bunch in, in courses in college, etc. You know, one of the things that I shocked me,
because it was now 33 years ago, okay, first people were doing calculus with Mathematica back in the
day. So I said, we're going to have this get together for the students who are in this very
first class doing this. So I'm talking to these students that say, what, you know, what are you
majoring? What are you doing? You know, oh, civil engineering, whatever it is. So I'm like, oh,
that's good, because you know, you just learned all this methodology, and all these computational
tools that you can now use for civil engineering. A person looks at me completely blankly, like,
really? Why? You know, that, that doesn't compute, so to speak. That's a pity. And that's something
where, you know, figuring out how you take the thing you learned here, and apply it there,
is very good exercise for people. Because, you know, in a sense, these, these classes are very
siloed. Like, you know, Professor A is not going to say, did you learn this in Professor B's class?
They're just doing, you know, the thing that Professor A is supposed to be teaching, typically.
And sometimes there are sequences of classes. But, you know, I think that that's, you know, that's,
that's another feature. I think I had a different
point I was going to make about sort of, yeah, another thing is this. So people,
people think, I think, a lot of students think, knowledge just existed from the beginning of
time. There was no moment when somebody invented that. I noticed this kind of interesting experience
with Wolf Malfour, because it happens to, you know, I put my name into the name of the product,
so to speak. And so I'll meet students who use Wolf Malfour all the time. They notice my name,
and there's this kind of strange double take of, of, where they're realizing that this thing,
which is just a thing that they use that sort of existed for a while, that a person was actually
behind this thing, so to speak. In other words, somebody had to create it. And this is a thing
people, I think, don't realize, you know, whether you're studying math or physics or whatever,
and there's some named algorithm or something or whatever, named, you know, law, whatever it is,
it's somebody had to invent that. Maybe it was the person who's named after, maybe it wasn't,
that's the way it works in academic science. But, you know, and then this idea that everything that
is now, and that you're being taught, somebody invented that stuff. And you could invent stuff,
too. It's not such a, people don't get that as easily as you might think. And, you know,
I happen to have been interested in history quite a bit, and in understanding, why do I,
why am I interested in history? I'm mostly interested in history, because very interested in how
ideas come to be the way they are now. So for example, I've just been studying, like I mentioned,
thermodynamics, which is a field that's about the second order of thermodynamics. It's about 150
years old. Okay. And I really didn't know in detail its history before the last few weeks.
Its history is an incredible mess. Its history, I mean, some very great people who figured it out
in the 1860s, and they kind of nailed it down by the 1870s or so. And turns out, a bunch of things
came to be believed within a few decades after that, that is simply not true. And, but if you
trace through what happened historically, I now sort of understand how those things came to be
believed. And it's interesting. And you kind of see that as a, first of all, you know, one of the
things is, I sort of realized these things aren't true. And it's like, how can I be saying these
things aren't true? People have believed this since 1870 or something. And it's like, I better go
figure out why people ever came to believe this. Because otherwise, I don't know whether I know
what I'm talking about. And if you trace it through, you realize people were having hypotheses
about how things worked in gases and so on. They didn't know gases were made of molecules. They
didn't know molecules existed. And so they had a bunch of theory. And actually, what happened is
the theory that was done on the basis of sort of idealized fictional molecules worked pretty well
when molecules as a real thing were discovered, people said, so the whole theory must be right.
So we proved the whole thing. But in fact, there was a different issue that happened there. But
anyway, I think this thing about sort of everything has a way that it was discovered. And sometimes
it's pretty interesting to learn how it was discovered. Another thing that happens is people
will be some field, there'll be some idea, and students will try and learn it, and they'll find
it confusing. And, you know, teacher will say, no, this is this way. Look, you know, it's in the
textbook. This is how it works. Student will be confused. Turns out, if you look at the history,
people were deeply confused sometimes for a long time. And it really is confusing. And what ended
up in the textbook is some glossed version of what was really there. And if you understand, you know,
if you understand that it was confused, and sort of how people got confused, and sometimes
it's really a good idea often to try and look at the original papers, books, whatever about things.
They are, I would say about two thirds of the time, they are clearer than anything that came later.
One third of the time, they can be impenetrable, because the notation has changed, the, you know,
the way people were thinking about it was kind of crafty. It was, you know, but a lot of that,
this just happened to me. I was trying to understand something about them in dynamics.
And I'm like, look, these textbooks are just absolutely opaque. And I don't think that what
they're saying is right. So eventually, I go back to a little book called The Theory of Heat,
written by a certain James Clerk Maxwell, who was the guy who did Maxwell's equations and so on.
So familiar, yeah. Right. And so it's, and the, the, his book is really clear. And it's really
clear that there are things, and he pretty much says it, that we don't know how this works.
Actually, he has a very lovely thing at the very end. He's, he's has a very lovely description
of lots of things. And then he's trying to explain, this is maybe 18, late 1860s, 1870s. So
he's trying to explain why there are only a discrete number, no, it was early 1860s, actually,
why there are only a discrete set of different kinds of molecules, even though he doesn't know
that molecules really exist. Okay. And so it turns out Darwin's Origin Species had been published in
1859. And so Maxwell has this chapter at the end of his book, in which he says,
maybe the reason that there are discrete sets of molecules is for the same reason
as there are discrete species in biology. And, you know, which is of course, complete nonsense.
Right. But, but it was interesting, it's interesting to see what, you know,
hypothesis they come up with. Yeah, right. And what's obvious and what's not obvious.
And, you know, that was at the time not known. Anyway, the, yeah, so we got down a bit of a
rabbit hole there. That's, that's, that's a good thing. Like, you, okay, you mentioned, like,
even during the Q&As, right, you, you, you realize that sometimes the, the kids would not know what
you're talking about, like, what's obvious to you might not be obvious to them. Right. And
all of these theories, hypotheses that we learn about, they're all structured in a way that is
intuitive to someone, eventually intuitive to someone reading it. Right. We think we fully know
like we understand how this is working. But in reality, we're still, it's still in hypothesis.
It's still based on our observations of that particular system. Right. But what if there are
things that do not have an intuitive understanding, like you mentioned in one of your TED talks that
the reason that you came up with the, a new kind of science is because
we're trying to describe everything with these human constructs, which is like exponentials,
integrals and everything. Right. And what if there, there are things that we're trying to
find answers for, but we don't have the systems ready to explain any of that. Like there's,
what if there are things that are unintuitive to our understanding and things that we cannot
comprehend. Well, so what happens, this is the story of the advance of sort of paradigms in
science and other places. That's what happens is people don't have an intuition. They don't have
a framework. They don't have an understanding. At some moment, for whatever reason, the pieces
assemble and that paradigm emerges. And then, then there is an understanding. I mean, it's even often,
you know, the words didn't exist to describe that thing. And then one sort of sees how it fits
together and then one builds this paradigm and then one's off and running. And yeah, without
that paradigm, if you're, I mean, I literally was just looking at this in connection with the
thermodynamics thing. So when I was like 13 years old, I wrote, tried to write this program
to do some simulation of gas molecules, okay, and didn't work. And I only just realized two days ago
why it didn't work. Okay. And the reason it didn't work was because of things that I discovered
in the 1980s about the way that simple programs behave and so on. But those things were so far
away from what my intuition or understanding was when I was 13 years old or whatever. And, you know,
couldn't get there from here. And for example, in the physics project that I've been doing the last
three years or so, which has been going really spectacularly well, you know, I realize that
that project, which is sort of I think our 100 year shot at actually understanding how a bunch
of physics actually works. But, you know, to get to the point of being able to do that project,
there wasn't really a straight line way to get there. It required different paradigmatic
understanding from things about computation, things, you know, actually doing experiments,
things like this. And it's something where, yeah, you know, you can't get to that point.
It is not easy to get to that point. If you are, you know, the student who is trying to solve this
problem and it requires some new paradigm, then, you know, you will not get to that point.
It's that's now I have to say, the sort of the meta paradigm of our times is computation. And
they're just in a huge number of things where it's just just do a computer experiment. Now,
you know, the technology stack I've been building for such a long time is the thing that I hope
enables that for people across lots of fields. If you're down in the details writing the piece of,
you know, Python code to do this or that or the other, you won't get there. Right. It's just
you'll be submerged in this kind of swamp. And, you know, you you have if you are if you're operating
sort of a higher level where you're really trying to think about things in computational terms.
And, you know, my attempt is to make a language that gives people the primitives
to sort of thinking computational terms. Then it's a really pretty good meta approach
to pretty much any field at this point. And it's one of these things where, I don't know,
it's got a it's got a run of at least a bunch of decades, where there's still a lot of low hanging
fruit that is completely unpicked in all of these different areas. And so, you know, for me,
it's like if if one is, you know, can one invent a paradigm for something can one understand what's
going on, try and make it computational. If you can do it, you have this big kind of, you know,
this big accelerator, because actually, it's sort of a unique thing, because something that has
not historically happened, which is you get that automated computational collaborators, so to speak.
That's never been possible before. You know, there's never been a place where once you can
explain something in these terms, it is not just a question of a human having to go do this, this,
and this. It's like, then I just put it in, and something automatically, you know, accelerates
forward, so to speak. So it's, it's, maybe I hadn't thought about it this way, actually, but I mean,
maybe this is, people are always convinced that history, the things that are happening now are
different from the things that have ever happened before in history. But I think, in that sense,
the kind of computationalization of things is a different thing that has happened in the development
of paradigms before, because it's a paradigm where you get sort of the automated assistant,
along with the paradigm, so to speak, in addition to just having a way to think about things.
But yeah, I think, I think that the, this question of, you know, a good example I've been working on
a bunch is quantum mechanics, where actually the aforementioned physicist Dick Feynman always used
to say, nobody understands quantum mechanics. And he'd worked on quantum mechanics his whole life.
Okay. And he would say, nobody understands quantum mechanics. And I think he was right at the time.
And, you know, I've been excited that at this moment, we seem to be getting to the point where I'm
almost to the point where I say, I think I really actually understand quantum mechanics.
And it's, it's a, you know, sort of a sound bite of how things work is, you might think, you know,
in classical physics, sort of definite things happen in the world.
Throw a ball goes in a definite trajectory. Quantum mechanics, sort of the big idea is
there are many different trajectories that you can follow, and you're only looking at
probabilities of different things happening. But the question is, sort of, how does that really
work underneath? And what we've kind of realized is that the sort of the history of the universe
branches and merges all the time. So instead of there being a single sort of thread of time in
the universe, there's this giant branching merging graph of threads of time. So then the question is,
well, why is it that we think that definite things happen? Because if they're all these
branching merging pieces, why do we think definite things happen? Well, then we realize, well,
we're part of this whole branching merging universe. So our brains, our minds are also doing this
branching merging thing. So quantum mechanics ends up being the story of how does a branching brain
perceive a branching universe? Which is at some level, you kind of realize, even from that description,
that it's going to be a little bit difficult to see what happens. But once you realize that
that is what is happening, you kind of have at least a fighting chance of being able to see
how it all works. And we're getting closer. And it's very, you know, it requires some different
ideas than people have seen before. But it's something where in the end, it's not mysterious.
And in the end, all those places where, you know, you had to make this jump, you had to sort of
suspend disbelief, so to speak. And, you know, to understand the textbook, I don't think you'll
have to do that in future. I think it's going to be something where you can just say, well,
it's this way, this way, this way. It requires paradigmatic ideas that people like ideas about
about how computation works and this notion of computational irreducibility about how you
sort of can't know the outcome of computational process more efficiently than by following the
steps and so on. It requires really having some intuitive understanding of those things.
And that's something that, you know, slowly comes. But, you know, given that, I think there will be
sort of a direct, it won't be a mystery thing where you just have to say, the formulas work this way.
Trust me, it's going to work out type thing. So, you know, but I think that
in terms of, you know, what students do and don't understand from textbooks, you know,
the project I happen to be doing these few weeks could be classified as a thing a student didn't
understand in a textbook 50 years ago, because I got this particular book about statistical physics
50 years ago. And I thought it was pretty interesting, but I really didn't understand
how it came to the conclusions that came to. And so my plan a long time ago was I would
make a computer simulation, the book actually had computer simulations in it,
to understand how it worked. I didn't manage to do it, because in the end, you know, I didn't know
a bunch of things that are from a paradigm from the future, so to speak. And that was, you know,
so, but that was in a sense, you know, for 50 years, I've been sort of picking away
off and on at this thing that was a thing I didn't understand in textbook 50 years ago.
And it, you know, I would say that that for the things you don't understand in textbook now,
you know, you go ask a professor, see whether they have anything sensible to say, they may not
have anything sensible to say. You know, another thing to realize about fields and things is that
usually a field gets invented, you know, this methodological advance happens,
there's a bunch of people involved, they're kind of intellectually entrepreneurial,
they build the field. Then people work in that field for many academic generations.
By generation number five or something, nobody thinks about the foundations anymore.
You know, if you talk to the people who built the field originally and you say,
hey, why does it work that way? Why does it work? Well, we think it works that way. I'm not
absolutely sure. It might be a different way. You go to the sort of fifth academic generation,
it's kind of, well, of course it works that way. You know, it's always worked that way.
It's in the textbooks that way. You know, there's no possibility of something different.
So one of the things that I found is kind of a little bit of a trick for doing research in a sense
is often if you go back to the foundations, there's a lot of stuff there that is still kind of
exposed and unresolved. And if you are 50 years later, for example, the methods that now exist
from other places will often allow you to make progress on those foundations in a way that
absolutely wasn't possible when they were first laid down. And so the people in those fields
will be like, you can't work on those foundations. They were laid down 50 years ago, 100 years ago,
and so it's a little shocking at some level. But it's also, actually, it's often easier to do that
than to go all the way up the tower of all the stuff that's been built in the last 100 years,
understand all of that, and then try and add a little piece at the top.
You know, that's a more difficult thing to do sometimes. And if you can make a foundational
change, the whole tower gets shifted. Of course, people may be very resistant to shifting the tower,
but that's a different issue. But certainly in terms of personal satisfaction of what one does,
it can be pretty nice. I mean, I think it really helps in a lot of these things, the thinking,
research, whatever, having some confidence that the things that you might just be able to figure
it out is important. And I don't know, different people get that confidence in different ways.
And some people, unfortunately, never get that confidence that they can just like
dig in and figure stuff out. But I think that's a valuable thing to try to achieve,
so to speak. And I don't know whether people who do the exercises, they do great in the exercise,
I think some people come away from that with the confidence that they can figure things out.
And other people come away from that having been trained to only run in this track.
And if somebody shows them something off that track, they freak out.
And so I think it goes both ways there.
That is such an interesting idea that you mentioned that how you explain quantum mechanics in the
sense of a bunch of threats, and that we see fields and ideas as a single threaded thing
that how it could be. So over the last couple of months, I've been obsessed about flying things.
And the way how I've been teaching myself everything is through writing. And one thing
I've realized is that I'm always inclined to learn about the history and just teach
myself everything about the history. Because like you said, we went on a, to put it in a more
like GitHub way, it's like you create a branch and we go all the way from there and we never
like merge to like other branches that could have happened. So when you go back to the history,
then you can see all the branches, all the different possibilities that you could have
picked and see and think that only by learning the history, like going back to the fundamentals,
you know, like reading, you know, Darwin or reading, you know, all this is just like,
or the original sources of how you can create possible like this new branches that you can
actually merge through different ways. Right. Right. But what was the subject you said, flying?
Yeah. So I planes or drones. Yeah. So like my idea is that I don't want to ever walk on campus
or take the bike or anything. And I want to, I want to create a personal flying vehicle.
Stupid. Maybe not. Who cares? But I've seen some demos of such things.
So I was like, okay, I don't teach myself everything about it and build some drones and
things like that. Anyway, so that's an example of how I have a singularity of like,
the history is such an interesting thing that can allow you. Well, I mean, drones are a great
example of, you know, why were drones not built in, you know, gas powered drones built in the
1940s or something. But the answer is because the control systems were too hard, you know,
and it was, it took, you know, flight control, microprocessor based flight controllers to be able
to actually make the thing stable because a human controlling it couldn't make it stable.
It was something computers do better than we do. But I think, yeah, I mean, that's a,
it's an interesting case where that that probably is, you know, I don't know, I was some, you know,
the Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, right? One of his obsessions in later
life was kites and flying things. And so there's these wonderful pictures I just happened to run
across them recently of these tetrahedral kite structures that he built, which are actually
fractal like things. And I don't think anybody's looked at those again. I mean,
it's a kite structure that has is some kind of trust that has some good weight to area ratio,
etc, etc, etc. Who knows? Maybe that's, maybe that's the thing that should be,
you know, delivering cell phone service or something from, you know, from flying high
altitude flying, flying things who would know. It is the case that, you know, in engineering,
for example, it's pretty common that an idea exists. And it was 50, 100 years ahead of its time.
And it could not be executed in the way that it was conceptualized at the time when it was first
developed. I mean, you know, the fax machine now past history, but that was that had 100 year
predecessor just wasn't possible until there was micro electronics and so on. And I think,
yeah, it is interesting to to there's probably, you know, people talk about, you know, understanding
engineering from biology, but there's also understanding engineering from engineering
history, so to speak. But yeah, interesting, you know, I was I was talking of flying the,
you know, in around maybe 1900 or so, Lord Kelvin of the temperature scale fame, famously said,
heavier than air flight is impossible. Okay, which has been quoted as a goofy thing for him to say.
I only realized I realized a few weeks ago, what his conceptual framework for saying that was,
which was he worked on the second law of thermodynamics. And one of the statements of
the second law of thermodynamics says perpetual motion machine is impossible, right, that will
take heat and make mechanical work out of it. And I'm pretty sure I need to go look at what he
actually wrote. I'm pretty sure that his heavier than air flight is impossible. He thought that
was a statement, just like the second law of thermodynamics. There was a statement that you
couldn't, I don't know, I'm not sure exactly, I have to read what he actually wrote. But it's
sort of interesting to me that that that statement, which on its face just seems kind of silly,
is actually probably had for him a not completely foolish kind of, you know, precursor and something
that people still believe, which is it's impossible to make a second, a perpetual motion machine of
the second kind that just, you know, from heat generates mechanical work. So, interesting. No,
I think I think it would be. Yeah, in fact, I wonder whether he actually imagined that,
actually, this is how they think about it. I wouldn't be surprised. I'm going to find this out. But,
you know, birds fly. Life didn't follow what they thought of as being second law behavior back then.
The fact that birds can fly and birds are alive might have meant that he thought that there was
sort of a special exception for what would usually be true for things that were alive, which he thought
there was for thermodynamics. I mean, confusingly enough, back in those days, the term, there was
this term vis-viva, which, you know, is Latin for life force. That was what actually turned into
kinetic energy. So that was what the name for kinetic energy was before it was called kinetic
energy. So that, of course, created another whole raft of confusion. When people did start in the
late Victorian period there, people were talking about life forces and so on in connection with
all kinds of spiritual, this, that, and the other stuff. And so that was another kind of entangled
confusion. But now that I think about it, I bet Kelvin made that mistake because he thought that
birds were a special case because they were alive. That's, that's, okay, that's a homework exercise
to find out if that was true. But interesting. Yeah, and all of that came due to the, like,
that confusion, perhaps came of a language issue, which, you know, philosophy, you know, like, would
never be complete because of language. And, you know, something related to that that I'm curious
to hear what you would think is that, you know, like Marshall McLuhan said once, you know, we shape
our tools and the tool shape us back. How do you, so in your life, your life could be described as
you created your own tools, you can own it, your intellect, which is kind of similar to
Angeberg had, you know, ambition. When you look back 50 years back, you created all these tools.
How do you think these tools have, you know? No, they define how I think about stuff. If it wasn't
for these, you know, if it wasn't for all from language, I would not be able to think about
things computationally in the way that I can. And, you know, the physics project, for example, would
not exist. Lots of things will be different. I mean, it's, it's, this is the way that, you know,
tools, language, these are the ways that one sort of concentrates thoughts so that one can build on
them. I mean, that is the people, you know, with the human language is people sort of are, you
know, wonder, does it matter what human language you speak, how you think about things, it probably
does a little bit, but it's, it's not a dramatic effect. With, you know, in the world of computational
language, it's a dramatic effect. Like you can see people, you know, who can think using, you know,
well, from language or whatever, you can just, you can think about how to set things up and you
think, how do I make this computational? You know, this is a way of concretifying those thoughts,
which I don't think would be easy to do without that. I don't think you would be able to, I don't
think you would conceptualize those kinds of things, just as it's pretty hard to think about
things for which there are no words in a human language. And it's, yes, so the answer is, I think
that, you know, the tool building is absolutely critical to, you know, things I've done. And,
you know, there's been this sort of spiral of, of do basic science, use that to build tools and
technology, use the technology and tools to do basic science. You know, I've sort of executed
about five loops around the spiral, so to speak. And that's, you know, another thing to comment on
in the world of sort of studenting and things like that is, it is shocking how much people don't use
the tools they can use. You know, it was, it's just like, like, you know, when I started,
well, doing physics and things, I started using computers to do sort of algebraic calculations
and so on. And, you know, there were experimental systems for doing this. It was not undoable,
but nobody else did this. And it was just like, why is nobody else doing this? This is not that
hard. And it's, it's, you know, you had to know a little bit about computers and things. And,
you know, your average physicists might not have known that, but physicists tend to be an agile
lot, and they can learn all kinds of things. But it was sort of shocking to me, and it is today. I
mean, you know, in, in our sort of computational language stack, there are plenty of people who
use it. There are plenty of people who are sort of leaders in their fields who use it. And there
are lots of people who aren't leaders in their fields often, who are like, oh, no, I don't use
that. I don't need to use that. I'm just doing this. And I don't really need that. It's like,
why are you doing this? You just tied both hands behind your back. You know, you're not, it will
be really difficult for you to achieve things that way. But for some reason, people, I think,
I don't know what it is. It's a, it's a sort of strange trait of, oh, I'm not going to actually
learn tools. Maybe it's the same thing as, as people who do a class about something,
and then are completely unable to apply that class. And so it's kind of like, this tool is for the
purpose of being applied. And somehow, unless I just do a class to learn this tool, and then I'm
just going to do that in that class, and that's the end of it, and I can't apply it. And maybe it's
the same phenomenon, I don't know. But you know, it's certainly something, you know, I see in the,
I somewhat, I mean, I quite often describe technology rebuilt as kind of artifacts from the
future, in the sense that it's things that, you know, if you ask people, could this be done?
You know, it's like, is this in principle, yes, it's impossible. Well, actually, you know, we've
done that. And it's like, but it's like, but that really seemed like it was something that should
happen only in the distant future, so to speak. And it's, I, one of the things I kind of like it
where this, this week is our annual technology conference. So a bunch of our sort of leading
users and so on show up. And that's the first one in person in a couple of years. So, we'll see
who actually comes. But, but I think the, the thing that's, that's interesting, the,
it, you know, I see these people who have sort of grabbed this artifact from the future,
brought it into the current time in their field, whatever it is. And it's like, it's like, you
know, it's like they got the extraterrestrial technology boost, so to speak. They're able to
do things that other people in their field can't do. And they're like, oh, wow, you can do this. And
it's like, look, I just, you know, they're just using this artifact from the future, so to speak,
that, you know, we happen to have built now. And it's, it's some, it's, I think it's, it's cool to
see that because it's something where people can just do things that seemed like they would be,
you know, that may seem to other people in those fields that were impossible. And I, you know,
I'm sort of shocked to that because I've been looking at some personal history of mine
to do with thermodynamics and so on. I'm, I'm reminded again of this craziness that, you know,
I've, I've done this many times of just taking tools from somewhere, using them and something.
And it's like, why did nobody else do this? This is not hard. This is not, you know, it
doesn't require a great cognitive leap to see that this is possible, but people just don't do it.
And I don't, I don't really know why. And that, that's some, but yes, the, the certainly for me,
you know, I have built tools that are sort of machinery for making things that I want to do
be possible. And then in the end, there are so many things, you know, as this tower has gotten
built, there are many things, there's no way I could have seen, you know, from the bottom of the,
of the building process. There's no way I could have seen what I can now see from where we are in
the tower. Now, you know, in terms of building machinery and tools, I mean, for me personally,
you know, I built a bunch of technology. I've also built company. And, you know, company is in a sense
a, a different kind of tool, a different kind of machine for going from ideas one has to real
things in the world. And it's a different, you know, it's not something where it's a transferable,
you know, anybody can just get this, you know, can download this bag of bits and run it themselves
type thing. It's a different kind of thing. But it is the same, perhaps the same instinct for me
of, you know, you build a tool that allows you to do things. And sometimes that's a technological
tool. Sometimes that's an organizational tool. Do you consider the, like the new kind of science to
be that hole in the history that you were mentioning that, like you mentioned, like even when we look
back at something that we've been learning for like 50 years, right? We still find like some
flaws or some holes in the history, like things that they didn't figure out, but they just got
accepted as time passed, and that people just started considering them to be true. And anytime
you try to mess with that, people, people are resistance and terrible resist basically, right,
like inertia. So do you think, is that why the new kind of science is facing this kind of resistance?
I don't think it faces any resistance anymore. I mean, I think it won. Because, you know, back,
if you look back 25 years, and you look at, you know, when people were making models of things,
how did they make those models? They wrote down equations. If you look today at new models,
people are making of things, they usually make programs. That was the point of new kind of
science. And, you know, it won. Now, it's a somewhat silent, you know, it's not something where
it's, you know, it's a sort of trumpet blaring, you know, thing. But if you actually look at the,
you know, the actual practice of science and so on, that approach won. And, you know, I think
it's interesting in the, when the book first came out, many, in many areas, people were like, oh,
great, new methodology for doing stuff. We're excited, off they went, they did things. And,
you know, I think it's an important seed for what has become this kind of program-based way of
doing science. The one community that I realized sort of long after the fact was the one that was
hostile to the whole enterprise with the physics community, which was very weird, because that
was a community that, among other things, essentially all those people use our technology every day.
And those people had known me for some cases a long time. And what I realized is that this was
sort of an alien invasion type situation, where it's like, this is paradigmatically different.
You know, I remember one person no longer alive, but a well-known mathematical physicist,
who I'm talking to him about, about this, you know, the book and so on. And he's like,
he's very upset about the whole thing. And he's like, you know, I look through this book,
I can't understand anything. It's a bunch of code and pictures. And, you know, it's because he's a
mathematical physicist who was used to, you know, trading in equations, so to speak. And it's like,
well, you know, I said, well, you know, that's the sound of a new paradigm, so to speak. You know,
it is different from what you know. And that's, now the thing that's been surprising with our
physics project the last few years is that what 20 years ago was a sort of a pitchfork,
you know, a big thing with lots of, not lots, a certain number of sort of physicists, oh,
this couldn't possibly be true type thing. That's actually melted away. And there's been
essentially no pitchforkery. And, which is interesting. I mean, I think it's happened because
first of all, fields go through different levels of self-esteem. And another one was pretty
interesting was when Wolf Malfour came out in 2009. I wondered how the AI community would
respond to it. Now, the AI community at the time was in deep winter. AI was, you know,
it was almost dead. You know, there was barely a sort of heartbeat there. And in fact, the people
in that community were very positive. And I think it's kind of like, wow, something works.
You know, and the methodology of Wolf Malfour is utterly different from the methodology that
people had had for sort of doing kind of brain like AI type things. In a sense, you know, one
of the things I remember, this big project had been done for about common sense reasoning,
where people had tried to sort of encode common sense reasoning in computational way. And,
you know, then in a sense, and then Wolf Malfour comes out, and many of the things that you sort
of thought you might be able to do, but couldn't really do with common sense reasoning, you could
just ask the question to Wolf Malfour, it'll give you the answer. Okay, so why did this work?
What I realized after the fact is that the common sense reasoning approach used a period of
intellectual history and science that predated the 1600s. That is, before the 1600s, you know,
it was all natural philosophy. There wasn't a mathematicization of the whole thing. So it was
kind of a, you know, if you want to figure out how this mechanical system will work, you imagine,
you know, you say, if you do this, then logically this happens and that happens. The other thing
happens. Well, you know, what we did was just cheat by saying, you turn it into a bunch of
equations, you solve the equations, and there's the result, which is what we learnt was possible
in the 1600s in the mathematicization of science. And in a sense, the sort of the Wolf Malfour story
is in part a rerun of that cheating, because it's using computation to do a bunch of things that
were not paradigmatically possible in other ways. But it's sort of interesting at the time that I
would say that the AI community, such as it was, it was pretty small actually, was very positive
about it. And I think now, with the physics project, perhaps physics has been in a slightly,
you know, there was a 20 years ago, it was kind of like, we're going to solve it with string theory,
you know, string theory, it's just around the corner, you know, we're going to, and it's obvious
that's not going to work that way. Although it turns out string theory is almost certainly a
limiting case of the underlying kind of machine code that we kind of have built for physics.
And although I'm still waiting for, you know, a bunch of string theory people are sort of
interested in this, but nobody's actually rolling up their sleeves and figuring out exactly how
this correspondence works. But I think there will be one. But it's, you know, so these fields go
through periods where they're in more or less, you know, we got it, we know how to do it, we don't
need anything from the outside. And, you know, I think, I think that that's so it's sort of a
different time for that. Is there anything you think you would have done differently back then
when it first came out? New kind of science? Well, I mean, the fact is, so one of the interesting
social media didn't exist, right? Had they existed, people who were like, Oh, you know, we got this
thing to say and oh, no, it couldn't possibly be true. And, you know, it's kind of a funny thing
because you you write a book that is basically based on computer experiments. Okay, people say,
they say, it's, it's wrong. So what do you mean it's wrong? You run the computer experiment,
does what it does. There's no that's not a there's not a concept. You know, it's like,
and I think it was a certain amount of you know, I made a conscious decision, not to kind of
you know, when people were by the way, you know, I made a decade after the book came out, I made
this kind of, you know, analysis of sort of what responses to it have been. The fact is,
the overwhelming answer was positive, excited responses. So but somehow, you know, in,
you know, any negativism, you know, there's a there's a certain amplification in one's own
perception, and so on. And so it's actually but but what I decided not to do at that time was kind
of engage in the kind of the mud, mud fight, so to speak. And it was very funny, because you know,
I gave, I went around the US, I gave like 25 talks at, you know, main universities and things like
that. And people are very polite. You know, nobody was kind of standing up and waving their hands
and like, you know, whatever. But yet, in a very cowardly way, people were like, oh, you know,
we control this, you know, we can write this thing. It was funny, because it was one guy,
this is the head now, chap called Steve Weinberg, who's a well known physicist, who wrote this,
was actually one of the, wrote this thing that was, I actually didn't read it, because I'm not,
I sort of follow the principle of not reading stuff that's written about, about things I do,
because I don't think it's a useful feedback loop. But, you know, he was like, oh, it's all
nonsense type, there was something I don't know exactly. But anyway, maybe a few months after
it came out, I happened to have lunch with him, I arranged to have lunch with him. And I'm like,
and it became clear that he just didn't understand it at all. And, you know, it's and he was like,
oh, I didn't get that. It's like, what part of, you know, again, it was one of these paradigmatic
things. And by the way, interesting thing there is the name of the book was, was more sensible,
even than I had thought at the time. Actually, it was funny, I was doing a podcast with a physicist
person, Lawrence Krauss. It's not, the name can't be a secret, because there's a podcast out there,
who is sort of, I think, was kind of like, oh, I can find, you know, I can find fault with this or
that. And then he was talking about, you know, a new kind of science and so on, and was kind of
trying to describe it and trying to characterize it and so on, and ends up basically saying,
you know, describing what it is and ends up sort of falling backwards into saying a new
kind of science. And I'm like, that's why I called the book that, you know, is not like the stuff
that had gone before. That's why I called the book that, which was very important for many people
in trying to read the book, because as soon as you prime people for the idea that an idea is a big
idea, their response and their way of thinking about it is very different from the way that you
say, oh, it's a small idea. The thing I've noticed is kind of interesting, even with stuff we're
doing now. So I'll give a talk, some group, it'll have scientists, sort of regular scientists,
I'll have some philosophers. Okay, this is the thing I found interesting. The scientists,
even though they have a big advantage in terms of content, often have a harder time
grasping a bunch of things that are going on. And why is that? The reason is, I think, I've noticed
that they don't understand that there can be more than incremental progress in intellectual
things. That is, they're looking for, there's just this one step that goes from what I already know
to what I need to know for this purpose. Whereas philosophers are much more used to the idea that
there's many steps and it's complicated and you don't immediately understand what's going on.
So it's a funny phenomenon. I mean, it may be totally biased about sampling because
it may be that the philosophers who show up to these things are philosophers who have sort of
sophisticated thinking about science and things like this. So it might be a completely biased
sample so far. So I can't necessarily say it will be generally true, but it's been a little bit
notable to me that that's how that's worked. But no, I think had social media existed when
NKS came out, I don't know. It might have been interesting to see how that dynamic would have
been different. I think that the concept, as I say, of I can be a troll, so to speak, and
write a review and nobody will come back to me about it is something that I think has sort of
evaporated in the world. And so that sort of changed the, I mean, a lot of other crazy things
that happened about sort of being able to get ideas out there and kind of this, you know,
you can't get that idea out because it has some ideological, political sort of bad resonance.
That's a different thing. That's a different phenomenon, which fortunately, I think it's fair
to say that the science and things that I've done has not really, it's been pretty independent of
those kinds of issues. I mean, fortunately, it's funny how these things in science end up
happening. I mean, like this idea of computational irreducibility that I first developed in the
mid-1980s, I was like, it's an idea in theoretical science. Okay, so many years go by, and I think
it's the idea that seeded the proof of work concept for Bitcoin. And so this idea, which I
thought of as this theoretical idea, you know, ends up being the seed for this thing that has, you
know, is for a while, at least, you know, burning the electrical output of, you know, some medium-sized
country and doing this crazy computational irreducible computation, so to speak. So that's a,
you know, it's very unexpected what happens there. And, you know, one, it is always a risk in doing
basic science that the things you do end up getting entangled with sort of what end up being
ideological, political types of things, sometimes ones that you're completely horrified by. I mean,
I think I'm lucky so far, you know, that that hasn't happened with things I've done. I mean,
the worst case is burning electrical output in proof of work, which is, you know, a lot more
benign than other kinds of things. But I think in, I mean, it is true that, for example, the idea of
computational irreducibility, which is kind of this realization that even from within science,
you discover that science has limitations on what it can say. That is something which the
realization of the fact that that's the case, if that was a truly well-absorbed thing, people's
attitude towards things like, can we predict this feature of a pandemic? Can we predict this thing
about, you know, global climate or something like this? Can we predict the results of this
geoengineering thing? Can we not predict whatever it is? The, you know, people, you know, when you
really internalize those ideas, you have a slightly different point of view about what, you know,
because we are in a period of time when sort of science can solve everything, except that even from
within science, science says science can't solve everything. So the big people haven't yet internalized
that particular thing. I think it's actually not a, it is a, you know, when it is internalized. I
think, I don't know, maybe it will go horribly wrong, but I think it is something that will be
helpful in terms of things which are sort of ideologically, I mean, I don't know, and in a
sense, it puts humans a bit more back in the saddle, so to speak, relative to what, you know,
in some sense, there is an idea that science, it's like, it all got solved with science,
you don't need the humans for doing anything else. Turns out that's not true. And it's, you know,
you see that in the case of people, you know, wondering, okay, we're building a bunch of AIs,
what ethics should we give the AIs? Well, you said there's a scientific answer to that.
Really? You know, what is the scientific answer to what, you know, what the AIs should be doing?
And, you know, I think that that's a case where in the end you realize, well, actually,
it's a question of what we want the AIs to be doing. It's back to, you know, back over to us,
so to speak. And that becomes a, you know, a case where, and I think this is a general thing that
you kind of learn from computational irreducibility and so on, that the humans need to be more in
the loop. Without the humans, everything is generic, so to speak. In other words, the, well,
what was become clear from our physics project, with this concept of the Ruliad, which is a,
this is okay, a deep rabbit hole. I mean, this is a, this is a, you know, the question is, you
know, if you believe that the universe is kind of a computational thing, there are these rules
that are running, they're generating everything that includes, you know, us sitting here, yacking
about stuff and so on. And then you say, well, why did the universe get these rules and not other
rules? And then you start realizing, well, maybe actually the universe has all possible rules,
but we are merely observing some slice of it, just like we are at a particular place in physical
space, you know, at this, you know, some corner of some galaxy and so on. Similarly, we are at some
corner of this kind of way that we are perceiving how the universe works and what rules it's using.
So this sort of the ultimate object that emerges from this is the thing we call the Ruliad,
which is the entangled limit of all possible computations. So imagine if you're sort of in
the computer science, and I should have mentioned theoretical computer science when I was talking
about computer science and kind of dissing it as an area because, you know, theoretical computer
science is great and it has lots of mileage. It's not what people mostly learn about when they,
and people who actually want to be, you know, production IT programmers or software engineers,
you know, knowing the theory of Turing machines is really not that relevant. It's a great field,
however. But the, you know, thought about in terms of those things, the Ruliad, one sort of
instantiation of it would be you take all possible Turing machines with all possible rules, all
possible initial conditions, you run them. It's kind of an entangled thing because two different
Turing machines can end up producing the same state. And so it's not the case that you just get
all this different threads of what can happen. So it's kind of, that's the, so anyway, this
Ruliad object, very philosophically interesting object because it's kind of a necessary has
to exist object because it is just a formal thing like two plus two equals four. Once you've defined
the terms, you have no choice about the fact that two plus two equals four. So you have no choice
about the fact that the Ruliad sort of is what it is, so to speak. And we're kind of our experience
is sort of based on these slices that we take of this, of this, of the Ruliad. And what we realize
is that, that in a sense, the Ruliad is the bland everything, everything it is. But our slice has
all the stuff that is, you know, our laws of physics, our, actually certain aspects of laws
of physics are quite universal, but, but our kind of particular experience and perception of the
world, so to speak. And what you realize, so here's, here's one of the kind of shocking sort of
philosophical, almost theological things to realize is that, in a sense, the growth of knowledge
is a growth of our extent in Rulial space. That is, at some point, we think the world works in
this very specific way. Then we learn more about how to think about how things can work. And we're
kind of extending this kind of domain in Rulial space that we exist in. But now you say, well,
what's the limit of that? What's the, what's, what's the future whole? Well, we could imagine
expanding our domain of understanding to the whole Ruliad. The problem is, then there is no coherent
us anymore. Because in a sense, the us, the thread of sort of, you know, we are at this definite
place in the Ruliad, we are, we are who we are, we are, you know, we are, we're localized in some
sense in Rulial space, just as we're localized in physical space. All of that goes away by the
time we sort of have, have colonized the whole of Rulial space. And so in a sense, it's a kind of
be careful what you wish for, because in the end, and it has a certain resonance actually with some,
I don't know enough about it, but with some things that people have concluded
in sort of various kinds of, of, of sort of theological traditions and things like that. Once
you, you know, by the time you get to the point where you understand everything, you kind of,
and sort of encompass everything, you no longer coherently exist. And so this is a, you know,
which is to say that the specialness of humans and the human history and all this kind of thing
is something that is kind of, you know, that, that's what makes it all, makes sense, so to speak,
without that it is all generic. And that, that makes it, it's, you know, and I think people kind
of imagine that with science, we have something that just genericizes, you know, it allows us to
just figure out what to do in some purely theoretical, we can prove it's correct kind of way. And
I think, you know, computational irreducibility and a bunch of things that, that have come out of
NKS, new kind of science, have, you know, kind of show one, and it wasn't where I thought it was
going at all, by the way. So that's a thing that's sort of interesting, because my personal, okay,
so, so this is sort of an interesting case. I mean, my personal ideology
is looked very inconsistent with the things that I was doing in science, even to me. I mean,
that is, it seemed like I was successfully deconstructing everything and making it sort of
taking it to the point where everything that exists is kind of ground down into these computational
elements that have no souls, so to speak, that have no kind of humanity to them.
Right, bare bones.
Yeah, right. But, but my personal ideology, you know, I like people. I, you know, run a company,
I've been running a company for 36 years, whatever it is, you know, it involves people, I find people
interesting. How is this consistent with a scientific, and for years, I didn't really
realize, and actually, I was kind of clued in, I got to figure this out when somebody asked me in
some interview, you know, how can these two things be consistent? You know, somebody who
actually knew me fairly well, who was interviewing me, and like was saying, you know, I know that you
are a sort of people-oriented person. How is this consistent with what you do in science, that you've
ground it down into this kind of, you know, these, and I then realized, actually, surprisingly,
sort of by a circuitous route, the science actually turns out to very much sort of fulfill,
in a sense, you know, even though that, and this is one of the challenges in doing science,
is to do it independent of one's own ideology about what should happen. And this is something I
think people sometimes, and it gets even worse when there's sort of a whole political angle to
the thing that comes in, but it's like, can you just do the science and figure out where the chips
fall without, and you know, I think somehow it's an important thing to have the confidence to be
able to do that, and to say, you know, the chips may fall in the way that I think I ideologically
want them to fall, or they may not. I'm just, you know, going to do what I do, and I'm more
interested in sort of having the science be coherent than I am in the fact that I happen to have
sort of realized some particular personal ideological goal. But I think, you know, I'm a
little disappointed, and I've seen that a bunch in the time of the pandemic and other such things,
that there's a certain tendency to sort of fall into these things where, you know, the science is
in service of the ideology, so to speak, rather than you just do the science and you see where the
chips fall, and you kind of might hope that it doesn't completely blow up your ideology, but,
you know, it depends what you're, it depends what you're in it for, so to speak, but I've always
found, I think one of the, one of the bigger achievements, if you're doing science, is to
discover things that you didn't think were there, and that maybe at first you even don't think could
possibly be true, and that maybe disagree with things that you sort of ideologically or sort of,
you know, in your intuition about science thought were the case. All right, we've covered lots of
things. Anything else you wanted to make sure to kind of hit? So I had one, one thing that came up,
well, while you were talking is that we are observing the universe from our vantage point,
right? We're only seeing a slice of the universe, and all of our laws that we're dictating are
based on explaining that slice of the universe that we're seeing, since we can never be fully
isolated from the system, right? So, but we know that there are other things that exist that we
don't know of. So how do you deal with this concept of known unknowns? Like, how can you begin to
comprehend them or? So here's a thing that has come out of sort of the science that I've been doing,
is you have this roulette ad, it has a structure, we can scientifically study that structure,
but then the question is, what do observers like us observe in this roulette ad? So the question is,
what do we need to know about us as observers to deduce that we will observe certain physical
laws as we know, as we, you know, write them down in textbooks? And what we've discovered is that
you actually don't need very many features of observers like us to get pretty detailed laws
of physics. So for example, the, you know, the fact that we are computationally bounded, the
universe is doing all these computationally irreducible things, but to fit it in our minds,
it has to be computationally bounded. We can only look at, we can only analyze a slice that is sort
of a computationally reducible slice of all the stuff that's frothing around going on underneath.
So that's first feature. Another feature is that we believe we are persistent in time,
which is kind of a weird thing, because at every moment we're made from different atoms of space.
So how could it be the case that, you know, we all think, oh, we have a past, we have a memory
of the past, it's still us, we, you know, we, there's a thread of time, there's a thread of
experience that is a single thread of experience. And the, and we are persisting through time.
So those two things turn out to be what need, what you need to get general relativity and
quantum mechanics, which is sort of two core theories, two core pillars of physics, as it's
known today. Now you ask yourself, well, if we were not observers like us, how would we perceive
the universe? This is a really difficult thing to think about. And because, and I've been interested,
you know, as we move outward in real space, we are gradually being perceiver, being observers
that weren't like the past of us, so to speak. That is, we are, you know, an observer of today
is different from an observer. For example, even this thing about using programs as ways to study
what happens in the world, you know, 25 years ago, people were like, you know, they didn't have the
idea of doing that. And it was, that was an alien idea, no longer an alien idea. And so I think
this question of sort of what is the perception of the universe from a, from a point of view
different from our own, I find this really interesting. I'm really, really curious about this,
I've been trying to poke my science fiction author friends to kind of write about this,
and some of them have written some things about it actually. But it's like, you know, there are
things, I think about it as sort of what's the distance in real space between different entities.
So, you know, different human minds are a certain distance apart. They are, you know, the way like
different machine learning systems will be a certain, they have different, they learn things in
a different way. And so they are perceiving the universe in a slightly different way. But we're
able to communicate. It's not so far away in real space as you get people who have different sort of
cultural background or whatever else. It gets more and more difficult to communicate the sort of
further away in real space. The concepts that we have are not ones that map as well into concepts
that we'll have developed there. So then you go to, you know, pets, for example, there's certain
things you can communicate. The dog wags its tail. There's some emotional thing that we probably have
in common with dogs that allows us to understand what's going on. But the full light, you know,
the full world view of the dog, we don't have a good idea what the world view of the dog is,
or the whale or whatever. And when you get further away than that, it's really difficult to know what
is the world view, you know, of this, you know, what's the world view of this thing in the physical
universe? What's the world view of a computer even? I was essentially trying to write something
recently. I finally get it done about what it's like to be a computer. It turns out it's pretty
similar to being, you know, and it's funny because, you know, you might think, well, you need to make
a whole AI and do all this kind of thing before it, before you can imagine what it's like to be
a computer. But you realize that between when the computer is booted and when the computer crashes,
it's pretty much like a human life. The computer accumulates a bunch of stuff in its memory.
It, you know, has certain experiences. It, you know, eventually, the thing is restarted from
sort of the same genetic material, so to speak. It's another set, another cycle, you know, it's
before the operating system crashes or whatever. And, you know, during its life, it has as many
things that are surprisingly human-like in terms of sort of it's an internal perception of what's
going on. And it's a case where we can more or less, you know, we can sort of interesting because,
you know, we have a hard time with human brains, you know, we don't get to record from,
from the, you know, 80, whatever it is, 86 million, billion neurons or whatever people
now say brains, typical brains have 100 billion neurons roughly. The,
similarly with computers, in principle, we might be able to record every single thing that's happening
in the, in the computer, but that's actually not in practice very easy to do. But it's still kind
of, it's a thing where we much more than with brains, we say we can point out what's going on
inside there. You know, for example, there's no free will to this computer. Look, we can see it's
got these, you know, transistors that are doing this and that and the other. Well, actually,
you can do that with brains too. We just don't happen to have the technology to do it at this time.
But anyway, this question of sort of what it's like to see the universe from an alien intelligence,
very interesting question. I mean, it's a, it's a fun thing I was, wrote about a little while ago.
Some people were pitching me a company that, about a company that, well, then their concept of it,
then it's now changed, thankfully. But the concept of it was we're going to make a bunch,
a million tiny interstellar spacecraft. We're going to have them go out and discover extraterrestrial
intelligence. We're going to bring back the technology from extraterrestrial intelligence
to Earth, forget all those extraterrestrial patent rights and so on. And we're going to accelerate
developments of technology on Earth by million years. Okay. So I was like, this is, you cannot
be serious, it's perfectly serious people. But you can't be serious. I mean, this is just a pure,
you know, it's a, it's an element for a script for the Silicon Valley TV show. Because it's,
you know, but, but what's interesting is what's philosophically wrong with this idea.
So, you know, you kind of go off and you say, we're going to discover alien intelligence.
And then we're going to sort of, and then we're going to bring back its technology.
Well, alien intelligence, it's kind of like there's many computational things going on in the universe,
which we can think of as alien intelligence is, you know, the weather has a mind of its own,
whatever else. And, but now the question is, well, what's technology to the alien intelligence?
You know, what's technology to the weather? What's technology to us humans? Technology to us humans
is we take stuff that exists in the world, and we use it for things that we have purposes for.
And so it's a thing where we're, it's not that there is an abstract concept of technology,
technology is all tied up with kind of the human purposes that we're,
that, you know, that we're following. And so this idea, what you realize is in the end,
the story of kind of go out and find alien intelligence and bring back its technology
is actually just the generic story of science. What science is doing is taking sort of aspects of
the universe and finding ways to turn them into things that we humans can relate to,
and then we can use them for our purposes and so on. So it's kind of a, that's in a sense the
communication with alien intelligence, abstract alien intelligence is sort of what science is
trying to do. Science is an attempt to find a language which allows humans to understand and
create narrative about what's happening in the world. I mean, in, you know, my main life work
of building our computational language is sort of the same thing. It's trying to make a language
that bridges between what we humans think about, right, and what is computationally possible.
And that's some, and, you know, at any given time in history, the things which we humans are going
to think about and care about will change a bit. Even over the 35, 36 years that I've been building
Wolfman language, it's longer than that, if you include the precursor that I built in starting
in 1979, it's, it's, so it's 40 something years. You know, it's been interesting because the,
the ambient things that people understand have moved a bit. And so the things that it makes
sense to put into a language that caters to humans. I mean, the, you know, the, the, as I've,
as I pointed out a few times when we do, you know, design reviews of some software engineering thing,
you know, our market is currently humans. And so things that involve, you know, like we're doing,
you know, the color, you know, visualization or something, you know, the mantis shrimp,
which has a lot more color receptors than we do, right, would have a different, you know,
would have a different view of how we should do, you know, color for visualizations,
but our market is humans. And, you know, it's, it's, and you sort of understand from that,
that there's a certain, you know, there's sort of humans at this time in history, so to speak,
who have a certain set of, you know, have a certain domain and rural space,
have a certain sort of set of paradigms. And that's kind of, that, that's what,
that's what they deal with. But interesting question. I mean, to me, it's just a super
interesting thing to try and think about what do, you know, how are different, what are really
different ways to think about how things work? I mean, I was, it was just, I was pondering to
myself the following question a couple of days ago, which was, you know, the Neanderthals died
out whatever 50,000 years ago, whatever it is, right? They, you know, they have made some artifacts,
which, in my case, we don't really understand what they, what they were for, whatever it means
to say what they were for, because that's a, you know, involves sort of a threat of purpose that
has to be connected to what we're talking about today. I was wondering, what would happen if
suddenly we discovered, you know, a giant work of literature written by the Neanderthals?
And, you know, how would that change? Because it's kind of like the discovery of an alien
intelligence. You know, it happens to be a, you know, a species intermixed with ours, but
it's still something where, and you know, what would be understandable? I also, it reminds me of a
long ago kind of funny project of, of, you know, video games for pets. It's kind of like, if you
could have, you know, your cat create, you know, Minecraft or something for cats. And you see,
you know, what does the cat make? And, you know, maybe it makes something where you say,
that just looks like a random bunch of blocks. I don't know what that is. And, but to the cat,
it's an incredibly meaningful, you know, deep philosophical poetic kind of thing.
That's right. Yes, right. But, but, you know, and that's this question of how do you,
how do you merge kind of what is the, the human view of things with, with something broader than
the existing human view? And in a sense, it is the goal of science to gradually expand that,
that view. And it's the goal of sort of intellectual development to sort of,
sort of expand to paradigms, which allow you to, you know, sort of get further in the, in the
space of everything that's possible. And I think this like common link with this computational
physics is, I think, critical to understanding how the other species is thinking, right? Because
as you mentioned, it's hard as humans to perceive or even begin to conceptualize.
Well, you know, this is the problem. We're all part of the same rule you had. But, you know,
we're taking sufficiently different slices. There will be features, okay, for observers like us,
with computational boundedness and persistence in time, all observers like us in that respect
will have some version of general relativity and quantum mechanics.
Although their description of it will no doubt be utterly, utterly different from ours.
But those kinds of regularities in the world, they will perceive. And I mean, you know,
if we did not have certain regularities in the world, it would be hard for us to operate
as observers like us. Now, you know, so take away those features, like take away persistence in time,
and imagine an existence where you have no persistence in time. I don't know what this is
like. I mean, I have no idea what, you know, there is no memory. There's no everything is different
at every moment. It's hard to imagine that. I mean, this is why I'm trying to get my
science fiction author friends to write about this. So see whether they can find a way to bridge,
you know, writing about this in a sort of human understandable way, because it may be
profoundly not human understandable. I mean, this is, you know, as a language designer, for example,
one of the things, one of the bad case scenarios is you run into something that just isn't human
understandable. You know, you run into something where you, you cannot present this, you can't
figure out a way at this time in history to present this in a way where humans will understand it,
so to speak. And that's, you know, that sort of a bad case scenario for language design.
Anyway, we should probably wrap up and soon, but you've asked all kinds of interesting things.
We've chatted about a pretty broad range of different, different kinds of topics.
Do I sense that there's sort of a one last question here, or did we, did we already do the one last
question? There is, your feeling is right. Yeah, so we asked at the end, we have a section that we
call overrated or underrated. So we give you a topic or a statement and you just give us, you
know, underrated or overrated. It's a fun, fun section. Okay. You mean, you will give me a topic?
Yeah, or, or, or, or a statement. Please go ahead. Yeah.
First one, which I would like to know your thoughts about is noble price.
Do you consider it underrated? Yeah.
Anything for which there is a prize is a thing where the most interesting period of its history is
probably over. In other words, if there is a field where there's a prize for that field,
it means there's a well-defined field. And it means kind of the foundational things already
laid. I mean, I think it's, it's, I mean, I have many friends who've won Nobel Prizes. Sometimes
sometimes it's, it's like, they did a bunch of work when they were young, and it's kind of like,
yeah, you know, wait 40 years and then they'll win a Nobel Prize. And it's sometimes, sometimes
that should have been very negative for their careers, because they kind of, yes, because they
kind of like, you know, a checkmark. I did my science thing. Now, you know, I've got nothing
more I can do. I'm never going to top that thing. And I'm just going to wait around and then I'll
get this prize. And I have to say one friend of mine won a Nobel Prize. Maybe he'd been waiting
around for years for this. I happen to see him in his office. He has a box that's labeled Nobel
shit. And I said, what is that? So it's all the stuff I got when I went to this Nobel Prize,
you know, ceremony thing. And, and he kind of hated it. So it was sort of an interesting
dynamic. So I think it's a, you know, prizes, you have to understand prizes are usually more for
the giver than for the receiver. So, you know, Alfred Nobel had his reasons for setting up this
prize, you know, he's mostly dead by the time it really got going. But, but, you know, it's something
where the, you know, I'm always interested, you know, occasionally, actually, I'm, I'm,
I'm actually, I used to win more prizes when I was younger than I do now. And I'm actually
fearing the time when, when I'll start to win all kinds of prizes, because that means people
think kind of it's all over, right? It's kind of like the end of an era. It's all over as in,
as in, and, and sort of everything's become well defined enough that it's like, oh, there's a prize
for this, there's a prize for that. But I think it's, it's somehow, I'm not a big, you know, again,
it's been, it's been something, yeah, I'm, so I would, I would definitely say overrated on that
one. There was a period of time when, when these, which I sort of amused me, I, you know,
there was a period of time when the Ig Nobel Prize, which is this thing about sort of
goofy discoveries people have made, got more, got more press than the actual Nobel Prize. And for
good reason, because a lot of the actual Nobel Prizes and things like physics were pretty dull.
I mean, they were like, you know, I barely even heard of that discovery. I don't particularly care
about it. Now, you know, things have changed in different fields, like in biology, for example,
there are really interesting discoveries getting made all the time there. And that's a place where
there's a lot more sort of energy, I would say, I'm generated there. But, but yeah, so I'm not,
I'm not a big, you know, I think that the main statement is, by the time there's a prize for
something, it's kind of the thing as well, that I like, I had this friend named Ben Lamantel,
because the guy invented fractals, who was just obsessed with winning prizes for things.
And, you know, he campaigned for years to win a Nobel Prize in physics and economics
and whatever. And I was like, Ben, wow, why do you care? Like, like the thing is, but the reason,
you know, if there was a prize for fractals, and there may be a prize for fractals now, I don't
know, that's kind of a sign that that field is now well defined, and sort of the foundational
stuff is done. Right. And, you know, it's more interesting, I think, you know, in my particular
things I find interesting, to do the foundational stuff than to do the things once the once the
thing is on its on its track. Very long answer. Try another one, maybe it'll be shorter answer.
Yes. You were friends with Steve Jobs, and, you know, he gave you the confidence to name
Mathematica, you know, you came up with the name, but he wrote it up again, he gave you this reason.
You know, Apple, do they have long, it's been almost more than 10 years since Steve Jobs died.
Apple, do they the technology, the products, what it stands for, overrated or underrated?
I don't know. Apple's a company, we've worked with a bunch, but it, you know, it's interesting. I mean,
Apple has taken a particular roadmap of sort of it's in a sense, it's the UX company, UX
industrial design, etc., and polish everything. They're doing a pretty good job polishing things.
I mean, I think it's disappointing that, that, you know, there are, like, I found a memory leak
in the Apple Mail program. Okay, that's, that's disappointing, because you would think that,
that the tooling would be good enough that that wouldn't be, at least I think it's a memory leak.
I'm not certain it's a memory leak. I think it's a memory leak. And, but, but, you know, it's,
it's interesting that that kind of roadmap, that I don't know when Steve Jobs really kind
of locked into that roadmap of kind of UX industrial design, kind of just make things smooth, so to
speak. But it's, you know, it's a pretty good roadmap, and there's lots of useful things that come
out of it. You know, I think, you know, as a company, to work with it's always a bit when,
when Steve Jobs was alive and there, you could send a mail and he would actually respond and,
you know, be pretty direct about things. It's, you know, people always used to say about Apple,
that it was this, it was this company full of, you know, secrecy, although it was a ship that
leaked from the top, in the sense that Steve would talk about all kinds of things. But everybody
else was like, it's got to be secret, secret, secret. And the, and I think, you know, as, as a,
you know, working with Apple can sometimes be challenging because of that, because the kind
of Steve, I think, is a little bit of sort of control and a little bit of showmanship,
kind of was very much into this kind of secrecy type thing. And I think that, that makes it,
makes it more difficult to, to work with a company like that.
And, you know, I found it surprising that, you know, Siri used Wolf from Alpha, too, which is,
I, you know, when I read it, doing the, some research, it was, you know, it was really cool
to see that. But yeah. And then the last one here, we started with college, and I think it would be
a good place to end with college as well. And you wrote at one point that you were at a dinner
with your son, and Elon Musk happened to be there. And your son went to talk to Elon Musk.
And they were talking about college somehow. And then your son, you know, learned from Elon
Musk that he went to college, and he saw a reason was to pick up girls. So that was what Elon said.
Yeah. Gosh, did I write that somewhere? I thought maybe I told that story, but I didn't think,
didn't think that was out there in the public arena. But yeah, that's, that's a story. It's
So the Elon Musk college theory, operator or underrated?
Gosh, didn't work for me. I met my wife long after I was in college. So the,
you know, and maybe because I went to college earlier than, than some people that that was,
it was not college was not my primary social thing. But I certainly, it's funny, you know,
colleges select certain populations of people, companies select certain populations of people.
You know, if you want to find a mate, so to speak, being in a population of people,
maybe you want one who's like you, maybe you want one who's the opposite of you,
I don't know. It depends on, but, but that's a, you know, so I don't know. I think that's a,
that seemed to be
observationally, it seems to be, I know at this company, for example, at our company,
I'm a little bit shocked at the number of, of, of kind of employee, you know, the,
we end up having, having quite a number of these, we've had many actually over the years
employees getting to, getting together like that. I think it's a, it's, so I'm not,
I'm probably not the expert on this as a, I'd be kind of, I would say that the,
I mean, it is true that one thing I will say is that, you know, in terms of just
people one meets and knows and so on, you know, one of the things that I've done
is, you know, I've met all kinds of interesting people in my life and, and I stay in touch with
them, you know, and, and in fact, I just organized a, a 50th year reunion for my elementary school
class, virtual reunion, which makes it a lot easier. The interesting, many, most of these people,
I've, I've sort of been vaguely in touch with at least once a decade since then, but I think
one of the things that I've noticed is that people are sometimes very bad at keeping in touch with
people that they have known. Maybe it's easier, I don't know whether, I don't know in the Facebook
generation, well, you guys are younger than the Facebook generation, but I don't know what the,
you know, that's old news at this point, but I mean, I don't know whether social media makes
it easier for people to feel like they stay connected and actually stay connected to people
that they've known in the past, but I would say that one of the things that's been a big positive
in my life is that, you know, I've, I've got met all kinds of interesting people in my life,
and I've stayed in touch with them. And sometimes the funny thing is, you know, I, I went to a
event that a bunch of people from my elementary school back in 2019, and there are people I
hadn't seen in 50 years. And what was so strange to me was, you know, started a conversation with
them, and you'll realize, you know, I have a decent memory, so I can more or less remember the, the,
the story, and you'll realize, oh my gosh, this is the same conversation that I had 50 years ago.
I'm just picking up, you know, the exact same interaction and conversation that I had 50 years
ago. And it seems like one of the things I have noticed is that people, you know, even over quite
long periods of time, people will say, oh, I lost touch with that person, I can't get in touch with
them again. It tends not, not to be true. It tends to be the case that you can, least in my experience,
and it's really kind of bizarre. I mean, people that, you know, that you can have a 50-year gap,
we'll see what happens with my, my, my virtual reunion. Maybe, maybe everybody will be like,
they don't know what to say to each other, but we'll see. I don't think that will happen.
And then how do you actually stay in touch with people? Like, like, how do you follow up? And like,
because I mean, I don't know, I send email every so often. And I, you know, usually one thing I
tend to do is, is modern times when I write stuff, you know, I'll send it to people where I think
they might be interested. And that gives me an excuse to kind of have a, have some amount of
interaction. But also, I suppose, yeah, you know, I keep a list of, you know, when I'm in place X,
go and see such and such a person. And, you know, some places where I probably will only be there
once in my life, but, you know, there's somebody I know who lives there. And, you know, so I'll,
you know, do that. And, you know, that's, that's a pretty typical thing. But somehow,
I mean, I suppose there's usually, you know, maybe, maybe part of the thing for me is that
I'm interested in enough things intellectually and business wise, that there'll be a reason why,
you know, this person who I knew 30 years ago, whatever, oh, there's some reason to interact
with this person, I've got some question I like to ask, or that person has a question they want
to ask me or whatever else. And that's, that's gives a sort of excuse to stay in touch, I guess.
I mean, if it's just the kind of, hey, how are you doing type thing, maybe that doesn't really
work. I think I'm, I'm probably not great in the hey, how are you doing kind of small talk
department. So it tends to be, you know, it tends to be content very quickly. And those
tends to be the people I know tend to be people who are interested in that kind of interaction.
I've done similar stuff where I write essays, and as an excuse, hey, would you mind giving
me feedback on this? And it's a way to stay in touch. So, yeah.
Right. I'm not sure you should ask for feedback. I think it might be better just,
you might find this interesting or, or this is a, because I think by the time you give people
homework, you're reducing the probability of response. Yeah. Okay, it's true.
Thank you for the, for the suggestion. But yes, thank you so much for, you know,
spending some time with us and really sharing everything that, you know, has made you,
you know, who you are in a way. So thank you for doing that.
Yep. You guys have asked good questions, had good comments. It's, it's been fun. Good stuff.
Good work. I'm glad you enjoyed it. And thank you to everyone for watching. I hope you enjoyed
the conversation as, as much as we did. Like we caught, we started off talking about institutions
and colleges and we ended up learning about some of the deepest questions that the physics,
like the physicists and people around the world are asking today and some of the puzzles that
are still puzzling a lot of us today and how the tools that we create can help us get closer to
the answer. And sometimes the answer might not be intuitive and something that will only make
sense with the tools that get invented at maybe like a hundred or 50 after 50 or 150 years from
now. So I think the crux is that the most important part of this conversation was that
to never stop asking questions. That's how these tools got created. That's how you would find a
way to get to the bottom of things. If you never asked the question in the first place,
you're not going to be inclined to solve them. So always keep asking questions. I thank you once
again for, for such an amazing opportunity and time with us and I'll be looking forward to the
next conversation. Thanks for your questions. Keep asking them. Always, always. Good stuff.
Good. Thank you and we'll see you next time.
