Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Power Hungry podcast. I'm Robert Bryce on this podcast.
We talk about energy, power, innovation, and politics, and I'm pleased to welcome back
for the third time. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the third time, Dr. Judith Curry.
She is the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.
Judy, welcome back to the Power Hungry podcast.
Well, thank you. I'm delighted to join you again.
So your book has been out now a couple of months, and it's called, as I said, Climate
Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response. You've been on the podcast before, but guests
on this podcast, I think you remember, introduced themselves. So you've been on here once, but
imagine you've got 30, 60 seconds. You've walked into a room. You don't know anyone.
Introduce yourself, please.
Okay. I'm Judith Curry. I spent most of my career in academia, most recently at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, where I was chair of school of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
for 13 years. I'm currently president of Climate Forecast Applications Network. I'm proprietor
of the blog, Climate Etc., at JudithCurry.com, and author of a new book, Climate Uncertainty
and Risk.
Very succinct. Well done, Attagirl. And you're also on Twitter, so we get this out of the
way, at CurryJA. Okay. Well, I'm going to just tell me, I've been reading your book.
Give me your pitch. What is this new book about? We've talked before on the podcast.
We've talked about climate science and the media, et cetera. What is this book, and what
do you hope to achieve with it?
Well, the whole climate science issue and the policy response has been squeezed into
this little tiny box, you know, with everybody bouncing around inside the box, dotting eyes
and crossing T's and threatening anybody who tries to go outside the box. Well, I blow
the lid off the box. I look at all the other stuff that people, the inconvenient things
that people are trying to shove under the rug. I look at the uncertainties. I look at
the controversies. I look at why we disagree, both in the science and the policy response.
I talk about, you know, how politics of this has really torqued us in a very unfortunate
way. I talk, the middle part of the book, I look at, speculate about what we can expect
in the 21st century in terms of climate. I mean, the climate models are deeply flawed
in terms of giving us a reliable perspective on this. So I speculate, you know, on a whole
range of possible outcomes, including plausible worst cases. And the third part of the book
is the most important one, really, it's risk and response. And this is where I talk about
how we've fundamentally mischaracterized climate risk and how we've fundamentally mismanaged
our response. And I use principles from a variety of risk science disciplines to put
together a menu of some other approaches that we can take that make more sense when you're
dealing with a very complex, deeply uncertain problem with conflicts of values and political
disagreements in play. So, you know, it's a very different approach. And it's a very
integrated approach to this very wicked problem that I think can lead us on a path to doing
sensible things and setting our path towards a prosperous and safe 21st century.
That's a good summary. Thank you. In looking at the book, though, and as I've been going through
it, and I don't mean this as a slam, but we talked about it right before we started recording,
so this was written or published by an academic press, Anthem Press. And it's heavily footnoted.
And I got to say, I love me some footnotes, right? I know I footnote all my books. It's a
laborious process. So, well, this is a kind of a geeky question. I could tally them all up here,
but about how many footnotes are in this book? Roughly? About 1500. 1500. 1500 in 239 pages.
So, you have your references here, which I think you made clear you wanted to publish this book
before we started. You said you wanted it published by an academic press, that it was peer
reviewed, and everything here you've stated is all fully cited. But still, I mean, the fundamental
issue that, and we've talked about this before, is that we're seeing this lack of robust debate or
even any debate, really, and that most recently, John Clouser, who won the Nobel Prize in physics
in just in June, in August, had a speech, a presentation to the International Monetary
Fund that he was canceled, because he's not towing the line on the catastrophist orthodoxy,
if I can use that phrase. I mean, it seems rather than getting better, rather than the debate
getting slightly more open, it's getting even yet more constrained, or is that fair? How are things
changed? Oh, that's correct. I mean, we'll go back to the little box again. And the reason it's all
been shoved into a box, everybody has to agree, because the oversimplified analysis that our
brilliant policymakers have made, is that we need global collective action on this problem. And in
order to get there, everybody has to agree. So, you know, so there's huge motivation with that
framing of the problem to nuke anybody who disagrees. I just want to make sure you said
oversimplified analysis. Is that what you, the phrase that you used? Yeah, right. So we have
to nuke anyone who disagrees. But that I think that seems to be the right description as well,
that there, we will not brook dissent, right? But is that so you've talked about this in academic
terms, because that's where you come from this. And I'd come at it from as a more, I would say
just a more general reporter approach. But if I were to say, well, what's driving this, I would say
it's money, right, that there is a lot of money at stake here for various subsidies under the
Inflation Reduction Act. This is one of the big drivers, of course, of the renewable energy roll
out, right? There are massive subsidies for wind and solar at hand. So there must not be any
controversy about this. Otherwise, the sub that you stop the flow of the money is that an oversimplified
analysis? It's an oversimplified analysis. Okay, have to go back to the 1980s and the UN
environmental program. There was a big drive for non governmental world control, you know,
through health, environment and all these issues. And they keyed on climate change is, you know,
the issue to get us there. And, you know, we had a climate change treaty in 1992, the UN
framer convention on climate change. This was before the temperature even started warming in a
significant way. And we couldn't, you know, the US even signed on to that treaty. So from the very
beginning, you've had the policy card way out in front of the scientific horse. And this is a UN
agenda. It's degrowth, it's anti capitalism, it's anti democratic. And in order to enforce this,
they amp up the alarm. I mean, you know, the worst rhetoric, I mean, apart from extinction,
rebellion or something like that comes from you and officials, you know, global boiling, code red,
you know, all of this kind of stuff over a slow creep of warming. And the agenda is to kill off
the fossil fuel industry. They don't like that. They don't like nuclear either. You know, so this
is a real, it's a clash of values. And there was a recent survey of university climate scientists,
and they asked them a bunch of questions. And a majority of them were in favor of degrowth,
not not green growth, but degrowth. Okay, so you can see the perspectives of these people.
I mean, it's not necessarily about money. There is certainly an element of, you know,
follow the money and all this. But there's a whole worldview and an ideology behind all this.
That's so that's interesting. I guess so maybe what I mean, in your reply is I'm not going to
argue with it at all. That is more on the science kind of policy side, I guess what my point about
the money and the subsidies is on the deployment side, right on the the amount of money that's
available for the mitigation side, right, which was where there's staggering numbers now hundreds
of billions of dollars, whether it's electric vehicles or solar or wind or hydrogen or carbon
capture. I mean, it's just a staggering amount of money. I think it's the biggest corporate giveaway
in American history, and there's no second place here. But but your your points are more on the
policy side about this ideology that's driving this alarmism, I guess to put it is that is that a
fair way to characterize it. Yes, yes. Oh, there's definitely money in flight. And you know, Warren
Buffett was very cynical. I mean, he was an early investor in wind power. Sure. He liked wind power,
but he saw with all these subsidies and whatever, I'm going to make money. He's no dummy.
The only reason to build wind turbines is to collect the tax credits, right? He said that
very clearly, right? That that was his his famous line. Okay, well, so I live in Texas. And let me
tell you, it's it feels a little apocalyptic. And let me just my climate. What is my view on climate
change? Climate change is a concern. And I think it rhymes with what your book says. Climate change
is a concern. It's not our only concern. So I not that I don't favor action on climate change is that
it's a concern, but we have to balance our action on that against other other concerns. And I think
if I were to boil down what I see in your in your book, you're saying something somewhat similar,
and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but it's been stinking hot here in Texas this summer,
Judy. I mean, it's just been and I'm used to the heat. I lived in Texas, I'm from Oklahoma.
Okay, so here's the question. The is it possible that the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in January
2022 is in part responsible for the weather or this hot weather that we're seeing now?
Okay, first off, Texas is an anomaly. If you look at the average temperatures over the summer,
so far for the US were slightly below normal. I mean, you look at this, I have to move then
is what you're saying. US has been cool. So, you know, Texas is just bad luck. I did my
my latest blog post that's up, looks at what is causing all this more on a global level.
And it looks hunga Tonga, and it looks at the ship fuels, and it looks like the long wave in the
radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere, it looks at the surface energy balance that looks
at the internal modes of climate variability. It's a very comprehensive discussion of what's
going on. To get back to hunga Tonga, hunga Tonga usually volcanoes spew particulates into the
atmosphere, which in the stratosphere, and that has a cooling effect. Well, hunga Tonga spewed
only a little bit of sulfate and a substantial amount of water vapor into the stratosphere.
So right now in the summer hemisphere, it looks like the effects
of hunga Tonga on the radiation balance are canceling out, you know, the long wave and the
short wave are canceling out. But if you go to the winter hemisphere, the southern hemisphere,
we are seeing the effects of hunga Tonga because the long wave infrared effects are dominating.
And you see it in a, this is part of the circulation pattern that's giving us an early
ozone hole and is giving us the low extent of the Antarctic sea ice this winter. So hunga Tonga,
and we may see a bigger effect of hunga Tonga in the northern hemisphere during our winter.
So that, but if you're interested in that, you know, check out my blogs,
JudithCarré.com. I've got a whole long post on all this.
I see. Well, I just found it. It was posted August 14th. I was looking at your other blog
posts with Jim Johnstone and Mark Jelenek, I guess, is that that's the one you're talking about?
All right, right.
Yeah. Okay. I didn't have time to look at that one. I was also looking at the post you did on
the hell versus Montana lawsuit, which I want to talk about as well. Okay. So I just want to
read back. So you're saying I can't blame the hot weather in Texas on hunga Tonga.
No, it's unfortunate circulation patterns. Okay. So, well, and that's it, but isn't,
I guess me even asking this question, as I say it, am I, this is part of the issue, right? Well,
why can't we blame this on that? Isn't this, of course, be due to that that there's,
like everybody else, I'm like, well, she tell me the cause, right? Oh, or is this,
and the Bill McKibbins of the world will gladly say, Oh, well, see, there you go.
You know, you guys in Texas, or in fact, Mark Goodell and the pages of the New York Times,
kind of, he said, in fact, in his piece, that this is, oh, this is like, you're getting payback.
Now, this is you're getting Texas is getting paid back for being a bad guy, right? That this is
like, this is the cause. Is this, is this part of the whole problem?
Well, okay, here's the issue. We're talking about a very complex, chaotic, nonlinear system.
And not only do we have a chaotic atmosphere, it's coupled to a chaotic ocean, and it's subject
to X, you know, changes in external forcing. And the mathematicians, you know, call this
pandemonium, it's even beyond chaos. And trying to unravel causes and effects
is, you know, not impossible, but it's not simple. You know, you can't do this by waving your arms.
And like the analysis in my blog, you know, it unravels a lot of things. And it gives you a sense
of how difficult it is to attribute any specific things to any specific forcing. It's very,
it's very challenging. Well, okay, so fair enough. And yeah, you have 17 figures in this,
in this posting here. But I guess maybe I'm my, my desire for that simple solution is
reflective of this kind of broader societal design. Well, of course, this means that and therefore,
we have broad terms, the way I see a lot of the climate, apocalyptic analysis,
we've sinned, now we're suffering, and we're going to pay the price. And therefore,
we have to repent, right, that this is, there's a lot of kind of Christian echoes of what,
you know, sin and redemption here, right? And is that part of the narrative as well,
that why this narrative is so strong? Again, this is the policymakers back in the 1990s,
wanting a simple cause and effect and a simple fix. And it was also the hubris that they can
control the climate by, you know, eliminating fossil fuels. So it's looking for a simple
solution. And just a total lack of humility and thinking that we can actually control this.
So, you know, it's just, you know, human failing. It's not surprising. That's why we have scientists
to sort all this out. But when the scientists become political activists, and become active
in trying to cancel anyone who disagrees with them, then the whole thing falls apart. And we
end up with nonsense like we're currently facing. And when you say the nonsense we're currently
facing, so, okay, force rank the nonsense for me, if you would, then if we're looking at policy
responses to climate change. And we've heard repeatedly from this, the Biden administration,
this is our main concern, right? And, you know, the president, in fact, at a League of Conservation
Voters meeting at a high dollar fundraiser, I wrote about this on my substack, bragged about the
fact that the Export-Import Bank of the United States was giving a $900 million loan to build a
solar project in Angola. Never mind that 60% of the people who live in Angola don't even have
electricity and we're building them a coal, a solar plant, not a coal plant, not a gas-fired
power plant, even though Angola has all kinds of natural gas. Okay, all this nonsense. So,
force rank the nonsense. If you look at this survey of what our responses, our policy responses
have been, what's the silliest of the silly? Well, this rapid rush to wind and solar. I mean,
that's the silliest of the silly. I mean, you know, I think it makes sense to think, to look forward,
you know, into the 21st century and figure out how we can, you know, improve our energy infrastructure
so that we have, you know, more abundant, cheaper, cleaner energy and let's look forward and try to
get there. I mean, that's just going to help support our progress in the 21st century. That's
going to require research and development and learning curves and different localities and
countries experimenting, you know, at the, by the end of the 21st century. If the market
was left to, you know, take care of all this, we'd probably have a much better, cleaner energy
infrastructure. But now that we're, you know, tearing what we have down and replacing it with
wind and solar, which is totally inadequate, I know I'm preaching to the choir here,
we're setting ourselves up to make ourselves more vulnerable to whatever weather or climate extremes
nature might throw at us. I mean, electricity helps keep us safe with desalination plants
and air conditioning and on and on it goes. And it's also electricity is the source of our,
you know, innovations across everything. So I mean, what we're doing is extremely stupid and
we've got politicians in charge of all this wind and solar stuff and nobody's talking to the engineers,
people who, who design transmission lines, the grid operators, you know, they're all sort of
tearing their hair out over all this wind and solar. So what we're doing is just plain stupid.
And if we continue on this path, we're going to end up in a worse place at the end of the 21st
century than if we had just let market forces and our desire for innovation just to take charge
and move forward. So it's just a very bad place to be. Well, you are preaching to the choir,
but amen, sister, keep going. Hallelujah. Past the collection plate. I'd boil that down or
how I distill this is if, if, if we're facing more extreme weather, it's the height of foolishness
or the depth of foolishness to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather.
I mean, we need weather, we need weather resilient systems, not weather dependent systems. And yet
that is in fact what we're doing. And just in the last few days here in Texas has been insanely hot
and the wind is going and the wind doesn't blow when it's really hot. And so there's been a, you
know, wind energy, we have a huge fleet of wind energy turbines, and yet they're only producing
at single digit percentage outputs during times of peak demand. So anyway, I just had to had to
throw that in there. Okay, so let's talk about censorship because you've also known a little
bit about this. We talked, I think the last time you were on the podcast, which was in December of
2022, that in on Twitter, you, you were very pleased that Elon Musk had Elon Musk took over
Twitter because suddenly you got more traction there, you weren't being throttled, your content
wasn't being throttled. Is that still the case now? Have you gotten more followers on Twitter?
Tell me about how you see what's going on just on that platform. And then we'll talk about other
things. Okay, just from my perspective, Twitter's going along great. I know a lot of people don't
like it. Well, they don't like, you know, the climate scientists don't want to have the rabble.
Questioning them, and they don't like that. And a lot of them are leaving Twitter. Also,
Elon has made a couple of changes to the functionality treat decks. Okay. And a lot of
people are very unhappy with that. So some people are leaving, but this the overall,
you know, from where I sit, I think it's so much improved. And, you know, the quality of my interactions
and the number of my followers has increased very substantially. So I'm happy. And I have to say
that's the only social media platform that I'm happy with. Well, then let's talk about the others
then you were on John Stossel's show. And it was, was it censored on Facebook? Tell me what I've,
this has been several days ago or a couple of weeks ago, but tell me about what happened.
It was labeled as false information. And this was me talking about my experiences and my
perspective. So I don't know how you label this as false information. So, and that was, you know,
labeled, they still left the link where you could click there. But there was this big warning
that this was false information because everybody knows that the consensus exists 97% of climate
scientists agree or whatever. No, there's no debate. I was on a podcast earlier this year
with the Heartland Institute. Right. And this was, it was live. And they, as soon as it started,
they took it down. Facebook did Facebook and they were sensitized to me because like about
two weeks earlier, I, there was a something posted on YouTube. It was an interview by
business news in South Africa. And it went sort of viral. I mean, it got like 500,000 views in a
couple of days. And then YouTube took it down. You couldn't even search for it. Okay, you couldn't
search for it at all. There was no message, no nothing, you couldn't search for it. So that
must have raised some sort of flag to Facebook. So as soon as they saw me being a guest on the
Heartland podcast, they just canceled that live feed. And they, you know, so I'm being really
canceled, you know, by the Mark Zuckerberg type social media. So, you know, and what I say,
if you actually listen to what I say, it's pretty innocuous. I mean, it's not cheerleading,
you know, for the team. But, you know, I'm just raising some critical questions. And that's very
uncomfortable. I mean, I'm well outside that little box. And that makes people uncomfortable.
And they view me as a threat. I mean, all those footnotes in my book, you know, it's like evidence
sort of supporting my points. And, you know, they view this as sort of dangerous.
Well, in the way you speak, in what you're talking about it, and, yes, as I've done, you know, a
couple hundred podcasts, and I'm a dad and, you know, been married a long time. I listen to how
people listen to how they say what they're talking about, right? The words matter, of course, but
it's, but there was a tone in your voice about what I describe it, disappointment, anger, frustration.
Here's the, you know, the TV journalist favorite, how do you feel? How do I say that? I'm just kind
of joking about it. But I can sense of you a kind of an outrage or just a disappointment. How does
it make you feel? Well, you know, I'm a scientist, you know, and reason, dialogue, evidence, debate,
and especially in universities, you know, debate and disagreement is the spice of academic life.
And all that's been canceled. You know, it's the universities which discuss me,
even more than social media. I mean, social media is social media, but it's what's going on at the
universities, to me, is the absolute worst. I'm seeing a few of the universities turn
around, but the overall tenor at universities is just, just terrible. And, you know, you saw this
whole dynamics play out with the COVID situation. It's just endemic to our society right now.
And it's very dangerous and free speech issue, political freedom, you know, there's a lot of
issues here. And unfortunately, a lot of this gets tied up in what's going on with Donald
Trump. And, you know, then it just becomes a big political mess. But these are very serious issues.
And I mean, how, I mean, God bless Elon Musk for trying to open up Twitter. He has his own quirks
and whatever. But overall, this is like the one place where people from across the spectrum
still come and, you know, engage and look at, you know, a broad range of material
everywhere else or most other places. It's in a pretty sad state. How are we going to get anywhere
if we don't think critically and engage in constructive debate and discussion?
You know, what you said about Twitter, I think we talked about this last time, but Alina Chan and
Matt Ridley, who wrote a book called Viral on COVID, they said the same things about the
importance of Twitter in terms of this opening the debate around origins of COVID. Now, which
clearly seems to be, as I think they suspected all along, a lab leak, right? Or the result of some
kind of a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But they were being censored
almost everywhere else except on Twitter. And this is before Musk took over. But that lack of critical
debate, the free and open debate, I have to agree with you. Because we're messing with the most
important system in our society, which is our energy network. And we're making it, we're weakening
it and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in the weakening of it, right? Because of the
fashion of, and it is fashion and the way I would talk about it, I guess, the, I call it
climatism and renewable energy fetishism, right? That we have this combined isms right there that
have replaced what has, I would call traditional conservation, conservation, the traditional
conservation ethic. And that's one of the things that I'm with you exactly on wind and solar. There's
this insane headlong rush toward these two sources of intermittent weather dependent renewables.
And with no regard for land use birds, landscapes, view sheds, it's this, oh, well, this is the,
this is the cure. And therefore, anyone who stands in the way, we're going to run over. And it is
almost that bold in terms of, I mean, some of the states are even saying they're going to override
local zoning laws to force communities to take wind and solar projects they don't want, which
just seems the absolute wrong way to go in terms of democracy and process, do, do, do process and,
and, and so on. And I know I'm, I'm, I'm rambling here, but does that ring, ring true to you?
Oh, for sure. You summarized it perfectly. I mean, this is,
this whole thing is dangerous in so many different ways. I mean, not just to our energy infrastructure,
but to our freedom and our, the, the political way that we do things. I mean, it's, it's a,
it's a very slippery slope that we're sliding down.
You said I wrote it down, you said the universities discussed me. And I, I reserve my disgust for a
few things. Lima beans and cauliflower are two of them, but unpack that just a little bit for me
when you say they disgust you. Why is that?
Well, because of the, the cancel, the cancel culture, all of the faculty members, you know,
very talented people can't get hired because they don't know how to write a good DEI essay,
diversity, equity and inclusion. And if you're a chemistry professor or something, what the heck,
you know, when you're talking about molecules, how do you bring that into your teaching? I mean,
there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. They're allowing students to
basically lead the charge to get rid of faculty members that they don't like for some reason.
They're interesting and provocative speakers are getting disinvited because
some students feel threatened by their words. And they, and they pander to this and they pander to
this. People who are sort of skeptical of climate change or
or in, in gen, in biology and right, all sorts of other fields. And I thought it was just really
climate change and biology, but people tell me it's rampant in law schools and social psychology
departments and political science departments, the same disease is rampant anywhere that there
is a that's socially relevant. When you're talking about that, it makes me automatically
think now of this held versus Montana lawsuit, which as I read the slumps when I brought it up,
you were an expert witness or retained, I guess, as an expert witness in that case and ultimately
did not testify. But when you were talking about the what's happening on the universities,
the line that comes into my head is grievance culture, right, that everyone's agreed,
everyone is a victim, somehow some way they've been offended or their future has been been somehow
clouded by this, that or the other. That was in fact the claim, the legal claim that these
teenagers made in Montana that the state was injuring them and their potential, their future.
And they won the court case under what seemed to be a fairly narrow ruling based on the Montana
Constitution. I know you wrote a blog post about that in June, but now we're here after the held
versus Montana litigation that they won and the Montana Attorney General said he's going to appeal.
How do you read that decision and how important is it?
Well, I don't think it's important. It might stand because the Montana Supreme Court seems to be
equally clueless and sympathetic to these environmental claims as the judge. So it may not
be overruled. If it stands, it's not going to have a big material impact on what goes on in Montana
in terms of changing, you know, the statute that they want to change because Montana and the
principle, I mean, it just adds a lot of paperwork to everything. Montana in principle can still
approve new power plants. It may end up slowing down wind farms by the same token with all this
extra paperwork. I don't know, but it's a symbolic victory for our Children's Trust,
which is the advocacy group behind this case and it's given them fresh steam
because they've been around for 10 years and this is the first case where they got any kind of
attraction, you know, they've been thrown out. Their cases have been thrown out everywhere
until now. They're still pending in a few additional states, but this is the first traction
that they've gotten. And to me, the most dangerous part of this is that like the state
legal systems are ill-prepared, both the judges and the state's attorney's office, to deal with an
issue like this. I mean, a technical issue like this. These things should not be decided in the
courts. Okay, they should be decided, you know, by the legislature, you know, elected legislators
and they should have hearings from people across the spectrum and, you know, wide the
deliberations and whatever, not by a single judge who's sympathetic to the defendants and
doesn't have a clue about climate science. And the Montana state's attorney, I mean, I was brought
on the case at the last minute, like the end of last September, and the lawyer that hired me,
he then left a few weeks later, there was a private company who then took a legal firm that
then took over and then the lawyer who was eventually in charge of the case didn't even
join it until December. And so he was left, you know, brought in at the last minute,
these weren't witnesses of his choosing. He didn't particularly understand the climate
change issue at all. He wanted, you know, the case to be about something different about
legal nuances. But in spite of my best efforts, I didn't convince him that this was really going
to be about climate change, and that you needed to deeply challenge their witnesses and, you know,
the points. And he just didn't know how to evaluate any of that. And I don't blame him.
I'm not surprised. I don't think there'd be very few lawyers in state's attorney's office who are
prepared to handle a case like this. Because of the complexities of the science, because of the
understanding where the plaintiffs, you know, where their weaknesses are, why is that? Is it
part of it? Oh, it's both. I mean, and it's, they were claiming psychological injuries.
You know, a few of them, oh, well, my roof was injured by a hailstorm and a barn on the neighboring
property burned down from a fire and the stream dried up. And I couldn't fish in the stream.
And, you know, these were psychological injuries. But a lot of it was pre-traumatic stress syndrome,
you know, the Greta Thunberg, we have no future, all of this kind of thing. So they're very deeply
depressed. So, I mean, the kids have been fed this insane rhetoric. The rhetoric targeted it
at kids and young adults is even worse than what we see, you know, with extinction, rebellion,
all that kind of stuff. And so, you know, they just don't have the critical faculties at this
point to evaluate it. And a lot of them are depressed and upset, whatever. But, you know,
we blame that on the education system, on the advocacy groups. I mean, if they were worried
about the psychological injuries of the kids, they should have been suing extinction, rebellion,
and Greta Thunberg and the National Education Association, which is sort of feeding them all
this stuff. But their real agenda is just to go after the fossil fuel companies. And using kids
is a prop. So it's a, you know, it's a case that made no sense. It's a legal decision that made no
sense. But like it's not the first thing that makes no sense in all this. So, you know, this is
really, I'm sure our children's trust the swimming and donations after this little victory,
so they can go on and keep suing everybody. I'm looking at one of the rundowns here that they
have been, one of their funders is the Rockefeller Brothers, which is a, I don't know, there's some.
Yeah, oil. Yeah. Okay. Well, the air to the Getty Fortune is funding extinction, rebellion.
Right. Yeah. You know, you've got all of these oil company fortunes now funding all this craziness.
Go figure. I want to reach back to you said that there is a lot of anti capitalist rhetoric
in this, in these discussions. Talk about that, because I believe I think you're right. And some
some of these activists have been very clear about that, right, that capitalism is the problem
that's driving climate change. And therefore we need some kind of Maoism or socialism or something
that would replace it and have some kind of authoritarian system. I was the only thing I
can imagine would be the thing that would replace it. But talk about why, how do you see that? How
do you see this? And why do you say that it's an anti capitalist movement? Well, okay, well,
if you look at the UN environmental program, which is, you know, really behind a lot of this
UN stuff, and you read what they write, and it comes through loud and clear, and not just anti
capitalist, but anti democratic, we can't trust the people or the countries to make the right
decisions. So there needs to be, you know, more coercion from the top down at the international
level from the UN. So it's a grab for power. So there's a lot of power grabbing in this and
capitalism and democracy is inherently against, you know, centralized power. So
yeah, there are people who've written a lot about this, but the solution is somehow more
coercion, more authoritarianism from presumably the smart people over the dumb people, right,
that they're going to be the ones that are going to make the decisions for us.
Yeah, well, President Biden is talking about declaring a climate emergency,
which would take, and it would be a long term emergency. I mean, emergencies are for, you
know, something going on two weeks or a month or a year, but not for something that's,
you know, decades. So that would, you know, force people to do this, force people not to do this,
that would take away a lot of freedom. So if he declares the climate emergency, and you know,
there's a lot of power grabbing going on in the name of this issue.
How do you describe your politics, Judy?
Well, when I go to a ballot, I'm looking for the not, you know, a voter's ballot,
I'm looking for the none of the above box to check.
Okay, that's my mind. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat. I'm disgusted and I am
disgusted, but I don't see a disgusted party. So,
Okay, yeah, I'm, I'm an independent with a libertarian streak. When I am totally disgusted
with the Republican and Democratic candidates, I'll vote libertarian by default. But I haven't
had any great enthusiasm for any of their recent candidates. But, you know, I'm hoping no party
or whatever, something can come up with something different because,
you know, another Trump Biden election, you know, the whole country,
you know, will just be tearing their hair out. So yeah, so I'm an independent. I'm a none of
the above. I like to think things through and listen to both sides. And, you know, none of,
a lot of these issues are just not simple. And there's clashes of values. So, you know,
I like the discussion, I like the debate. So I don't pledge allegiance to anybody or either side,
that's for sure. I'm going to go back jump back to the, the just stop oil crowd and the, you know,
the climate rebellion people or whatever the extinction rebellion people, because I find
some of the these people who are throwing the soup cans and blocking the traffic and the rest of
one, I for their punishment, I want them to go and live in rural Kenya with without any,
any hydrocarbons and be forced to stay there for two years and just tell us, you know, report
back and maybe this has changed your mind. That's my, that's my idea for punishment. You can't use
any modern, modern energy sources, sorry, none zero and then see how you like it. But I also find
it's somewhat depressing when I look at them and how they feel the victim. So they feel so
aggrieved. I mean, there's something, there's something deeply disgusting about it, right?
Because I think I see them also as just completely spoiled and uneducated about the world around
them. But there's something pathetic about them. Does that, does that ring true to you? And I just
kind of riffing here, but I see something very deeply sad in the way they act.
Well, it's part, it's a part of the broader victim culture and identity
politics, you know, it's the need to culture, victim culture, right? Yeah, that whole thing. So
it's, it's, it's a tribal thing. And the held lawsuit is part of this, right? That this is an
identity, right? This is an identity of, oh, we've been agreed, we've been wronged and we're going
to seek redress for this, this affront to us and our, our, we have somebody in authority who's
going to, you know, pay the bills for them to go out and throw, you know, cans of tomato soup.
You know, it seems like win-win, you know, they think they're saving the world.
They're part of a tribe and somebody's paying them and encourage, you know,
somebody in authority who's paying them and encourage them to do this. So it's, you know,
I think all of those things are contributing. But it is very sad that these kids aren't doing
something better with their time, more, more productive, you know, getting educated and getting
jobs. And this is personal for you. You're a grandmother, am I right? Oh, I'm a grandmother
for sure. How many, how many grandchildren? Well, I have one grandchild and then five step
grandchildren. So we've got a nice crew and they're all of junior high and high school age.
And you talk about these kind of political issues within? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And they,
and they think, you know, I'm cool because I'm a little bit subversive, you know,
that's good. Let's see what the real truth is. So they seem to all have healthy attitudes,
you know, about the situation. And my granddaughter, who lives in Reno, you know, close to where I live,
she's very rational. She says, well, I just really need to learn more about this whole issue.
You know, I just, I don't think I should have a big opinion about this right now because I just
really need to learn more about this issue. You go girl. Yeah. So let me ask you about,
we just have a few more minutes. And again, my guest is Judith Curry. She's the author of this
new book, Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response. By the paperback,
it's much cheaper than the hardback. It's out by Anthem Press. It came out in June.
I'm gonna ask you about the ending of that in just a minute. But you have your own website,
JudithCurry.com, and climate, et cetera. So you have your own media outlet. I'm just curious,
can you give me an idea how many visitors you get there? Because I'm increasingly convinced
unless you own your own media outlet, you're not assured of a free press.
You know, I haven't joined Substack or anything else where I might get traffic. When I first
started the blog, it had huge traffic. I get less traffic these days. I think on a big day,
I might get 10,000 visitors. And if something gets picked up.
But that's still a respectable number. It's a respectable number. And I'm not actually looking
for influence. I'm just looking to engage in the dialogue and to set up a space where people from
across the spectrum can come here and discuss. And I also host a number of very interesting
intelligent people as guest authors. And it's even spawned a few books, three books, in fact,
that have grown out from posts on my blog. No kidding. Yeah. And so I'm very happy with the
blog, even though it's not high traffic. And in all honesty, I think my lab that there was a
three week period when I didn't even post something. So it's not like I'm posting four times a day
and really trying to build trap. It's just my personal record of what I'm thinking about and
what I'm investigating. And it really seated my book. I started the blog in 2010 with a series on
climate science and the uncertainty monster, which was a major theme in my book. So this blog,
in many ways, documented my journey in writing the book. It's an interesting way to think about it,
because I'm talking with other writers and, you know, I've written six books and I don't think
I have another one in them. But they view their substack or even their Twitter or other places
as a way that they catalog what they know, and then they can come back and use it as a resource.
So I want to we're going to close here in just a few minutes, because I know you're on a tight
schedule and so am I. But at the end of the book, you have a section called toward post apocalyptic
climate policies. And you quote the economist Richard toll, who is an interesting character,
I've met him once, he said, politically correct climate change orthodoxy has completely destroyed
our ability to think rationally about the environment. I touched on this before, but I like
that because it speaks to the issues of land use, which I've been reporting on for a very long time.
And met many people in rural America in the course of my travels in Michigan and Wisconsin,
and all over the world that you're fighting these encroachment of these wind and solar projects.
But it seems that that to me is the concrete example of this clouded ability to think about
the environment that this climatism has trumping all of these other concerns. I don't know.
Your book is in some ways kind of a technical book, but you also have these quotes that are
really great in each section. So you really, that was the most fun part of the book was
I think, you know, selecting quotes and figuring out where to place them. I mean, it was, it was,
I spent an awful lot of time doing it, but it was the most fun part, really, of writing the book.
Well, I enjoyed it as well, because you have a go ahead from dirty Harry and may west.
You know, you know, Bruce Lee, you know, popular culture figures along with philosophers and
scientists and things like that. So. But it breaks up the kind of it made it less of a technical
that gave it some leavening some some breathing room, I guess I would say, right? Because you have
a lot of technical things that heavily footnoted the footnoted and the way you structured it
in some ways is more textbook like and you said that the publisher is targeting
universities and academic outlets or academic buyers, but I found that part to be good. So
let me read this one section here and then we're going to wrap up. This is in your concluding
section. You say we need to open up space for dissent, disagreement and discussion about
scientific uncertainty and policy options so that multiple perspectives can be considered
and broader support can be built for a range of policy options. Wicked scientists are willing
to become embroiled in political debates and thorny social problems to be effective. We need
to break the hegemony of disciplinary researchers of disciplinary researchers, particularly for
those who are strident political activists as being regarded as experts for solutions to the
wicked problem of climate change. I couldn't agree with that more. I thought that was a really good
summary of I think what your your point is we need we need more robust debate about the best
path forward and my thing has always been natural gas and nuclear. If we're serious about this,
these are low carbon scalable, you know, but just the lack of policy debate about what the way
forward to me is very a very dangerous one. So I commend you on the book. I thought, you know,
it's really obviously an enormous amount of effort. So I have to wanted to draw a part of
our discussion to an end there because I thought that was very well stated. So thank you for that.
Last two questions and you know, I asked these and I asked you these before. So what are you
reading? What's on the yeah, I know you're busy with climate forecast actions for climate forecast
applications network your business. But I know you must be an avid reader. So what's on your book
shelf? What are you reading on these? What's the top of the pile? Oh, gosh, I wish I could remember
the name of this book, but it's a book by Andy West. It's in the grip of culture. It's about the
social psychology of climate catastrophism. You know, the Greta phenomena or whatever. And this
is another like scholarly book, but it's very readable in the grip of culture. It's called
yeah, in the grip of culture. Okay. I think and it's about the social psychology of climate
catastrophism. I see something like that. So so that's like, I highly recommend that. I think
that's the main one I want to recommend at this point. Okay. Last question. What gives you hope?
What gives me hope? Well, that people can be rational. And I think that we are in I think
this in the grip of culture book explains a lot. And, you know, we just need to get out of that. And
I'm also, I mean, at some point, the weather is going to turn a little bit more favorable. We've
been in a bad place since 2017. You know, the natural climate oscillations will shift at some
point, five years, 10 years into a more favorable state. And hopefully people will calm down. And
about this problem, I think that the apocalyptic rhetoric people are realizing that they've gone too
far. I mean, having a whole generation of kids who are depressed and too scared to do anything,
isn't going to help the movement. So they have to figure out how to make their message a little
bit more hopeful, not just destroy the psyches of all these kids. So hopefully the catastrophic
rhetoric will came down. But, you know, rat, you know, at the end of the day, things that don't
make sense, aren't going to have a long lifetime. They can cost us a lot of money, cause us a lot
of pain. But at the end of the day, you know, sense and economics will prevail. But we're
certainly not there right now. Well, that's a good place to stop. So that's where we will
in fact stop. My guest has been Judith Curry. She's the author of a new book called Climate
Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response. You can find it, I'm sure, on all the major
bookselling outlets. She's on Twitter at currieja, and you can find her on the web at Judithcurrie.com.
Judith, thanks a million for coming back on the Power Hungry podcast. A very interesting book and
you know, I applaud you for efforts at your efforts at trying to open up the debate. And
if these are the most important issues of our time, and I think they are important issues,
let's have a debate about it. Let's talk about it. Let's examine it. And your work, I think,
is helping that effort. So good on you. Okay, great. Thanks. It was great to talk to you again.
Okay, so thank you, Judy. And thanks to all of you out there in podcast land.
Turn it to the next episode of the Power Hungry podcast. It might be as good as this one,
we will find out. But if you have a chance, also give us a good rating on those podcast
outlets, wherever you can give us four, five, six, 12 stars, whatever it is. And until next time, see you.
