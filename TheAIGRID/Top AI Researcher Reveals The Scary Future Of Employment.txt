So this video is rather important because it discusses the future of employment and it's not
just a random person. This is from Avital Balwit and this is someone who actually works at the
Frontier Lab and Thropic and her insights into how the future of work and employment is going to
change are very important for individuals like yourself and of course me. So I'm going to do a
deep dive on this entire thing because I truly believe that this is really important that you
can stay ahead of the future. Now if you enjoy videos that are specifically focusing on how you
can use AI to better your life and of course preparing for AGI such as how to invest in AI and
benefit from the trillions of dollars that are flowing into the industry don't forget to check
out my post AGI preparedness group. This is where videos like this actually get uploaded a few days
earlier but without wasting any more time let's get straight back to the video because it's really
important. So essentially this is a post about my last five years of work. Now if you aren't
understanding the significance of this trust me at least watch the first 10 minutes because
it's truly truly incredible. So essentially what we have here ladies and gentlemen is a post by
Avital Baluwit and this is Anthropics Chief of Staff okay and this is kind of like a personal
reflection slash diary on how the next few years of you know the economy are going to go for the
average person in regards to work and where they fit into the economy and how things are going to
be working. Now the reason I'm covering this is because I think this is probably one of the
most remarkable insights that we are lucky to have to get because a lot of these you know
people at Frontier Labs they truly don't talk about how the future of work is going to be
so it is something that I think is very very important for us to discuss because this is
something that is truly truly pivotal especially for this monumental period of time. So there are
four main things I'm going to timestamp them in the below but just take a look at this so
she says I am 25 okay and these next three years might be the last few years that I work okay remember
this is Anthropics Chief of Staff and she says that the next three years might be the last few
years that I actually work which is number one an incredible statement but number two it should
show you the gravity of what we are truly dealing with here. It says I am not ill nor am I becoming
a stay at home mum nor have I been so financially fortunate to be on the brink of voluntary retirement
I stand at the age of a technological development that seems likely should it arrive to end
employment as I know it. So this is not some kind of clickbait title where I'm trying to draw you in
this is the exact word from this person who is working actively at Anthropic. Now Anthropic is
one of the leading AI labs that made Claude III which is of course Claude Opus which is one of
the frontier models that is performing very effectively. Now what we can see here is something
absolutely incredible we can see them stating clearly that if it does arrive okay you know whether
we're standing at the edge of this which seems likely that it's going to end employment so
you know a lot of the time okay individuals in certain communities they may discuss labor and
work as something that of course is you know going to be there for many individuals like you and
myself but the prevailing trend from many of the industry leaders that I continue to see is the fact
that there won't be any true work after a certain period of time due to the fact that we have a
situation on our hands where the technological developments that are coming are most likely
to end this paradigm hence the reason post-age app preparedness so that you can navigate this.
Now basically she then states I work at a frontier AI company with every iteration of our model I am
confronted with something more capable and more general than before that's just absolutely crazy
with every iteration of our model I'm confronted with something more capable and more general
before at this stage it can completely generate content on a wide range of topics it can summarize
and analyze texts possibly well and as someone who once made money at one point in time as a
freelance writer and prided myself on my ability to write large amounts of content quickly a skill
which like cutting blocks of ice from a frozen pond is arguably obsolete I find it hard to not
notice these advances okay remember that one I find it hard to not notice these advances
freelance writing was always an over subscribed skill set and the introduction of language models
has further intensified the competition now remember the whole point of these videos is to
ensure that you are paying attention because a lot of people just say ah you know we'll find
new jobs we'll be fine and I think that's very very ignorant because it's quite hard to ignore
the kind of developments that are going and eventually they will be you know impacting
nearly every industry on the planet so it says the general reaction okay and this is where you
know this is exactly what I say the general reaction to language models among knowledge
workers is one of denial okay one of denial okay and this is why I'm making these videos because
I want you all to understand that whilst yes in previous technological revolutions
like when we had the industrial revolution of the farming industry and many people were thinking oh no
all of these computers are going to take our jobs and all of us that work in the farm industry
you come the problem is is that we're of course going to be having a situation where no longer
are we going to be needed in the farming industry so we might lose our place in society but of course
in that stage we did have a lot more things to do but the reason that this time is different okay
and you shouldn't be in denial okay especially among knowledge workers is that AI is the
automation of automation so it's a feedback loop because AI is something that can automate itself
which is different than previous generations remember that this time is different so it says
they grasp at the ever diminishing number of places where such models still struggle rather
than noticing the ever-growing range of tasks where they still have reached or past human level
this is something that I truly truly think people need to understand it's about how you view the AI
problem okay many people literally just focus on the fact that LLMs you know hallucinate once or
twice or in generative AI images sometimes they make mistakes but you kind of look at things
you're like wait overall okay like if we take the entire pie of AI into account overall there's like
a small subsection that with every iteration is growing and growing and growing and growing
whereas like most people like oh no it can't do this small bit oh it can still not do this small
bit oh it can still not do this small bit and eventually what's going to happen is that it's
all going to be able to be done by AI which means that like if you're at this stage right now where
you can see that okay AI is slowly starting to surpass human cognitive capabilities it's best
at this point to be like okay I'm gonna you know pay attention here and at least position myself
rather than being as she states in a place of denial so you know she says many will point out
that AI systems are not yet writing award-winning books let alone patenting inventions but and this
is the most important thing most of us also don't do these things okay and this is what I'm stating
but a lot of times people like oh AI can't write you know an entire novel from scratch and AI can't
you know paint this and it can't make this poster you know coherently with the text in five seconds
like I could but you couldn't do that most people couldn't do that AI is able to do a lot more than
the average person which is the point okay most people don't do these things and this is something
that most people are failing to acknowledge okay the economically and politically relevant comparison
on most tasks is not whether the language model is better than the best human it's whether they
are better than the human that would otherwise do the task and this is the most important distinction
I'm going to say it again the economically and politically relevant comparison on most tasks
is not whether the language model is better than the best human it's whether they are better than
the human that would otherwise do the tasks basically this question is the best question okay
because it shows you at what point things get automated and this is what I've spoken about
before imagine this for example right you have someone who works in a store okay let's say that
person previously they did you know check out at a grocery store okay right now we have AI
self-checkouts or whatever we've got all these kind of crazy things going on of course the
self-checkout is just a piece of technology but the point is guys is that is it sufficient to have
an AI system be better than the average person that would do the task in any scenario where that is
true you are going to get automation of that labor it doesn't need to be better than the best person
it just needs to be better than the average tasks that it would take and that is the important
distinction because a lot of people think oh this thing can't create Hollywood blockbuster movies
it's not gonna you know affect the movie industry but it will affect other industries like the film
industry the photography industry all of these other ones especially when you know we look at
future models how much smarter they're going to be just because they're not going to be as smart as
Einstein it doesn't mean they're going to be smarter not smarter than the average researcher which is
of course very fascinating and then it says this makes the objection that AI systems are not yet
coding long sequences are doing more than fairly basic math on their own a more relevant one but
these systems will continue to improve at all cognitive tasks okay and that's an important
distinction because a lot of the cognitive labor you know it's kind of going away from the trends
that we can see okay the shared goal of the field of artificial intelligence is to create a system
that can do anything and she says here that I expect us to soon reach it and if I'm right
how should we think about the coming adolescence of work so now here's where we talk about the
future of society so she says that it's not worth noting that upfront that even today work is far
from the only way to participate in society but nevertheless it has proven to be the best way
to transfer wealth and resources and provide personal goods like social connection status and
meaning and of course it offers social goods like political stability and here's where we get into
the crazy things given this should we meet the possibility of its loss with sadness fear and
joy or hope the overall economic effects of agi are difficult to forecast and here I will focus
on the question of how people will feel without work whether they will or can be happy and there
are obviously other vital questions like how will people be able to meet their material needs many
have examined this question and this is the important part here okay and this is why I launched a
community and why we're working on all these things many have examined this question okay
with no final answer yet as adopted by official policy for this contingency by any government so
there is not a single government that is currently looking at this problem and thinking okay this is
going to be an issue in a few years how are we going to tackle this and I think that that is
important because many people think that okay the government is going to be there to take care of me
but I would say that the government aren't really babysitters they just kind of look over you every
now and again to see if you're doing all right and if you're not about to die the government
doesn't really care about you that much of course depending on where you live this is something that
can be argued of course but I do think that this is for the majority of societies and the majority
of things it is very very true and of course you can see I will go ahead and assume that people can
meet their needs through universal basic income or other transfers and will solely concentrate on
the question or whether people can and will be happy or at least as happy as they are now
without work so here's where we talk about the obsolescence of knowledge work so you can see
I expect AI to get much better than it is today and research on AI systems has shown that they
predictably improve given better algorithms more and better quality data and of course more
computational power labs are in the process of further scaling up their clusters the groupings
of computers that the algorithms run on and machine learning is a young field with an enormous
amount of low hanging fruit in terms of discoveries I mean say fruit there and this means that you
know researchers can continuously find improvements on the algorithms of these AI systems so the point
here and I think this is one that you know it kind of goes back to what Leopold Aschenbrenner said
is that when we take a look okay at the fact that there is a lot of low hanging fruit this
kind of shifts our opinion it's not a field that is you know mature to the point where you know we
are you know at the edge of everything that we know or at least what we think we know and it's
very unlikely we're going to get a breakthrough for another 20 to 50 years like in some fields
this is a field that you know when we look at you know the fact that if we know that we scale
up another 10 times we're about to get a whole lot lot more we know that if we improve the data
quality and the amount of data we're about to get a whole lot more improvements we also know
that there's a lot of inefficient algorithms that we do use and we know that there are literally
a million different ways to improve these models in terms of the algorithmic efficiencies in terms
of how they respond so the point here is that there is a lot of low hanging fruit in this industry
and we're only at the frontier of what these models are going to be capable of since we haven't
like exhausted all those things if we had like exhausted the compute capabilities all the algorithmic
discoveries and we were like at the wits end and these are the kind of systems that we had
then maybe potentially it could be argued that we were near the end in terms of the growth
especially in terms of the curve maybe the growth would you know start to slow off like that so
that is why i think this is really important because there was a lot of low hanging fruit
that could truly give us a lot more exponential gains and you can see while there is an enormous
amount of data that has already been fed through them there is still more to be found and it could
also be generated by the systems themselves so given the scaling laws we can reasonably foresee
that these systems will keep getting better at least until these inputs run out so at what
rate will they get better language models are not for the most part continuously improving
they get better in discontinuous jumps a rough analogy to the current lm process is that making
a new model is like baking a cake you figure out your data and algorithms like mixing the batter
then you pre-train the model that is to run it on a large number of computers for several months
like put it in the oven then you do some post training like frosting and decorating the cake
and of course this can adjust the model in certain different ways to make it more harmless
honest or to make it good at certain specific skills or use cases but what matters to most
of us for the model's capabilities or at least right now of course is the underlying cake and
this can't be easily adjusted without starting over and baking something entirely new so when it
comes to the rate of progress when these models seem to plateau you should actually assume that
that just just means that the next model is in the oven but just hasn't come out yet and basically
what they're stating is that whilst yes you know some people do talk about how
there is this iterative deployment at open ai from what we can see growth in lm's is kind of
like this we hear a staircase we hear a staircase we hear a staircase because essentially what you
have is you have let's say for example you have gpt5 which brings us to this level then we got gpt4
then we get gpt5 okay and the reason it's kind of like that is because like they said you have
this middle bit here where the model is being you know trained whatever or you know mixed or whatever
you call it whatever and then of course at the end you've got the post training and of course here
you've got the pre training so this is essentially where you know you're training the model for this
entire period of time so what's interesting is that this period of time where you train the model
this entire period of time do apologize for the colors there but training the model and then of course
the model gets released after the post training and then that's when we get those new jumps which
is why it's very hard to say that right now you know things are plateauing because these models
do take several months in most cases to train especially because the clusters can't support
that much you know work going on at the moment so here we can see many expect ai to eventually be
able to do every economically useful task which is a truly insane statement so many expect ai to
do every economically useful task which is absolutely crazy and remember she agrees now this
is anthropics chief of staff here and it says given the current trajectory of technology
i expect ai to first excel at any kind of online work essentially anything that a remote worker
can do ai will do better copywriting tax preparation customer services and many other tasks are or
will soon be heavily automated i can see the beginnings in areas like software development
and contract law generally tasks that involved reading analyzing and synthesizing information
and then generating content based on it it seems ripe for replacement by language models
so basically right here this gives you a first insight into some of the careers that are under
not scrutiny but under the microscope in terms of where things are going to be truly automated
you might want to note this down i will have of course all the notes on in my school community
so that you guys can easily read this and digest the information and an easy to use matter but
guys this is some key key statements that people are not paying attention to because the main thing
here is that anything on a computer anything remote anything online those things you have to
think now about okay if i'm a remote worker if i'm someone that's enjoying my life traveling
around the world well that's what i want to do i need to think about these industries here and
how i can position myself okay to not be automated away or to not at least be less economically valuable
than an ai system sure you might be 10 better than an ai system but you have to remember that it's
much easier for a company to replace your high salary with an ai system that costs much less
and i do think in the future what we will see is ai systems that are truly truly effective
and of course that can run for 24 hours remember you're just a human you can't run for 24 hours
like these ai systems can and with all the ai agents being built on the back end trust me guys
things are truly ripe for disruption so you need to think okay how could i do this okay and how
could i manage myself better in order to at least not be in that place where i'm less economically
valuable than this thing and here's where we have some more stuff so here's where we get to the
obsolescence part and this is where we actually start to look at certain industries and how things
are going to be changing so essentially what she talks about here is that you know this is not
going to come for every industry at the same pace it's not like one day everyone's working and next
day everyone's not we're going to have a situation on our hands where this area is now affected this
area is now affected this area is now affected and it's going to definitely be proportional to
ai system releases for example when gpt5 does release i do expect a wider range of jobs to be
not completely automated but very nearly on that chopping block level to where you know there's going
to be another wave of potentially layoffs or potentially you know companies that used to
hire people not hiring people and the problem is is that these effects are downstream meaning that
if someone was going to create a company in the future and they choose not to create a company
you don't experience that level until like maybe 12 to 48 months after because the companies that
would have replaced the old ones that wouldn't hire you those ones no longer exist so overall
that entire market share has died down so essentially the pace of improvements in robotics
lags significantly behind cognitive automation it's improving as well but more slowly so
this is basically what they're saying is that if you do anything with your hands that is pretty
intricate um and a guided specific situation for example you know surgeons gardeners plumbers
jewelry makers hairstylists as well as those who repair ironwork or who make a stained class
might find their handiwork contributing to our society for many more years to come and this is
of course uh you know very very true i do think that you know people in these industries they have
a unique set of skills that you know for a robot to do as well as a plumber it's very very hard
considering you know the fact that it needs to navigate its way into a house deal with the customer
be able to identify what's going wrong stop the water flowing uh whatever issue it may be
then coordinate with all of these kind of things like if you try to get a team of you know engineers
to to get a robot to do that that would cost a lot and it would be so expensive to do that but
you know an AI system that's on a computer running that can take control of a computer
that is something that is vastly easier which is why a lot of the people who work at desks
are more at risk than someone who does a manual labour job and this is something that i think
this trend is important to pay attention to so of course regulated industries like medicine or the
civil service will have human involvement for longer but even there expecting increasingly
number of human workers who are you know supplemented with AI systems working alongside them so
basically with this one is that if you work in a regulated industry or you're thinking about
getting into one i think those ones are still pretty good for the future because regulatory
boards and stuff like that they do take a lot of time to allow people to get into their industries
you know for example like to become a doctor there's all these tests you have to take to
become a lawyer you got to pass the bar you got to do this it's this whole kind of thing
whether you want to call it status even if the even if the AI system is better there's just this
human kind of aspect where even if AI systems are better because of the regulatory bodies and how AI
might be viewed at that time AI is probably not going to be penetrating those industries
very very soon like it's not going to be okay AI's here boom let's use it they're still regulatory
bodies that people you know follow and it's going to be really hard to change those because small
changes and small issues with AI systems unless they're like a hundred percent and unless they
have no bias know this know that know that it's going to be really hard to change those legacy
industries because they are very very resistant to change and they were built upon those you
know strict foundations so you know careers that have like you know all those regulations around
them I think those are going to be secure for a very very long time now of course we talk about
industries that are going to be preferred for humans so for example you know those jobs that you
know where you want a human to do it even if an AI system might be better so for example jobs that
might fall into this category include counselors, doulas, caretakers for the elderly, babysitters,
preschool teachers, priests and religious leaders, even sex workers much has been made of AI
girlfriends but I still expect that a large percentage of buyers of in-person sexual services
will have a strong preference for humans and I think this is an interesting term here
nostalgic jobs and I think that term actually does make sense so you can see that these jobs
right here even if you have like an AI system that is you know just amazing you know sitting a
baby like let's say it's great as a babysitter I would not want an AI system babysitting my child
I would want it to have the human to human connection I would want it to understand what
other humans want this is just going to be something that maybe as I grow older and as I
you know get older into my older years I'm just like that old person who's scared of robotic
technology and I'm like no I want a human looking after my kid or whatever or maybe you know even
people growing up now they still find it weird but over time those values can shift as robots
become more and more useful and as they become more and more human like so it's going to be
interesting to see how things are going to be you know done in the aspect but these jobs right here
they're essentially valued because there is a human right there so if I was going through a problem
I wouldn't really want to talk to an AI system because the whole thing about like counseling
and stuff like that and being you know talking to a therapist is that there's a human who actually
empathizes with you and no matter how smart an AI system might be it hasn't had its own you know
subjective or objective whatever you want to say experience of the real world so it's not going to
be able to empathize with you on that way that an actual person that can be like oh you know I
understand that I went through that you know I've had this experience I had that happen to me when
I was 21 um and that actually like the things like that are just completely priceless so those
things there like those areas and categories are going to really are going to really do well
which is why it's important to like kind of look at this because you know a lot of people don't
understand truly the dynamic on how things are going to change given the nature of AI going now
for the rest of this article there are some you know in interesting things there is the psychology
of employment which is you know as automation rolls out across these industries how are people
going to feel and basically what they're stating here is that you know evidence shows unsurprisingly
okay in fact no this is actually quite surprising is that you know basically they're trying to look
at how unemployment actually affects people okay and it says that one study that tried to
tackle this looked at the effects of unemployment caused by the collapse of the Spanish construction
industry on mental and physical health and this particularly study was attempting to disentangle
the causality because people who lose their job during a nationwide collapse of an industry
will avoid this election effect these individuals are no more likely to have mental mental or physical
issues than other members of the population and it says by looking at large-scale survey responses
before and after the crisis they found that unemployment did appear to increase the likelihood
of reporting poorer health and it says here it does seem that overall unemployment makes people
sadder, sicker and more anxious but it isn't clear if this is an inherent facts of unemployment
or a contingent one okay because basically the problem is this right if you right now
you're unemployed okay why are you sadder think about that for a second okay why are you sadder
you're sadder because number one you might have less status because you don't have a job and number
two you know you don't have any money okay you don't have any money coming in so you might think
okay i'm not bringing any value into society and i'm not making a living for myself and of course
i might be homeless and yada yada yada and you can see right here you've got all these things that
they talk about okay you know the financial effects are probably the main one like if i gave you
right now 10 million dollars and i said you can never work a day in your life you know you're
never allowed to have a job even if you wanted one you just are not allowed to work most people
would laugh run off with a 10 million and be like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about and
that's the main point here is that it's hard to understand whether or not humans derive
meaning from employment or it's just the contingent effects okay and you can see right here is that
of course this might not occur in the context of universal basic income and of course it's
compounded with the shame aspect of being fired or laid off when you know you really feel like you
should be working as opposed to the context where essentially all workers have been displaced
intuitively it seems that there should be more negative psychological effects from losing a
job in a way that feels like a personal failing or that sets one apart from one's peers versus
losing a job in a blameless way or at the same time in the same manner as one's peers basically
what they're stating here is as well is that whilst you might think that a lot of people who lose
their jobs during this revolution might be sad if everyone loses it at the same time like people
did in the pandemic people actually don't increase their psychological distress because
everyone's in the same boat you can see here they found that individuals who were temporarily laid
off in april of 2020 reported lowest levels of distress compared to their peers remained employed
and you can see here the widespread nature of layoff normalised the experience reducing the
personal blame and fostering a sense of shared experience and of course financial strain was
mitigated by government support personal savings and reduced spendings which buffed against potential
distress so basically they're stating that there might not be as much angst and as anxiety in the
future if everyone is in the same boat but i do think that this is going to be nuanced because
there are going to be a lot of industries that are affected before other ones as we previously
discussed knowledge work cognitive labour jobs jobs on our computer those ones are going to be
automated heavily away first and it's not going to be all at once some companies are going to
choose to implement them some companies are going to say nope we're 100 human run we're never going
to use AI that's going to be their marketing gimmick those are the companies that you kind of
want to you know work for and be you know you know aligning your options with but it's going to be
kind of interesting as well like you know if you're looking to work for a company you know try and see
what their CEOs view are on AI of course every CEO's incentive is to make more money so they're
probably going to do that but you'd be surprised at how things work in the future and this is where
we get into two of the most interesting concepts here okay and this is where she talks about in
banks the culture books and this is where you know they're completely post-skeptical society
money is viewed as crude and irrelevant for allocating resources living space raw materials
and energy are produced in abundance for its citizens and the capacity of its means of production
are ubiquitously and comprehensively exceeded every reasonable demands it's not unimaginative
citizens could make yet culture at least has one need that this abundance cannot satisfy that feeling
was the urge to not feel useless basically to cut the nonsense this passage highlights the fundamental
and AI need to feel like they are contributing to something larger than themselves even in a
paradise where all material needs are met the psychological need still persists and she states
here that you know you can think about it right now do you do anything that you are notably worse
at than other people just for the sheer value of doing it she talks about how you know being a
ballerina even though she's in her mid-20s and you know being a ballerina is long behind her but
moving her body like that still brings her joy and this is where she talks about post-agi so she
says a renowned AI researcher once told me that he is practicing for post-agi by taking up activities
that he's not particularly good at jujitsu surfing and so on and savoring the doing even without
excellence this is how we can prepare for our future where we will have to do things from joy
rather than need where we will no longer be the best at them but we will still have to choose
how we fill our days we will also not need to choose how to fill our time alone in the context
where we are all out of work and where this is one of our main worries it means we built relatively
aligned artificial general intelligence for the same reasons i expect us to reach agi i expect it
to progress beyond this point to where we have superhuman systems for the same reason these
systems will be helpful with anything we should expect that these systems will be able to help
with the problems that they create and basically what they're stating here is that if we get superhuman
systems that replace us there's no reason to think that they cannot help us if we don't have meaning
in this future world and i think this article is very important like i said i'm going to have like
a you know a short private blog where i summarize everything into a nice area on my school and this
video you know is likely going to be released on the school community going to be released on the
school community a few days earlier because this is the community where we discuss how we can actually
navigate this stuff and i don't want you guys to feel like look there's nothing i can do there is
so much that you can do in order to be proactive especially in the last few years of work there
are investments that you can make there are ways that you can transition your career from one area
to another there are mindsets that you can use there are frameworks that you can apply to your
life to ensure you're not one of the people that get first automated because whilst automation is
something that is coming it might not get you first if you're able to move out of the way
and you're still able to be relatively valuable in the economy that's what the entire thing is
about so let me know what you think about this entire document it is definitely a long one maybe
i did go over my time limit here but i think this is probably one of the most important articles
because i think by at least 2027 we're truly going to see the trajectory of where things are going
because at that stage we will likely have had at least four to five years by 2030 of AI development
we will likely have the biggest clusters being built we will likely have maxed out the you know
physical hardware so we're likely going to see where those developments are going to be in the
sense that any more improvements are going to be hard to come by and therefore we know that the
jobs that currently exist for humans are probably going to be there for quite some time so this was
something that most people just did miss but i'm pretty sure that this article was something that
i think is definitely valuable to those of you who are concerned about the future of post-age
economics let me know some of your thoughts on how all of this is going to go down and what your
plans are and if you enjoy this video i'll see you in the next
