So I would like to present our speaker, Mitya Grimovsky,
Professor of the Mastering of History.
He will begin on the topic about smoothing
and pig-dragging stories.
Please, Mitya Grimovsky, the stage is yours.
Hey, great.
Good morning, or good afternoon, depending where you are.
I feel almost mandatory to give a talk on fluids.
I don't work with supplications of fluids.
I work with applied PDEs and stability of nonlinear waves.
But I was lucky that I had an undergraduate student last year,
Spencer Locke, and with him we reviewed lots of fluid material.
And I think my talk will be something interesting,
so it's on a classical subject.
I'd like to mention that Spencer just finished his undergraduate
degree, and he is moving to University of Michigan
for graduate study.
Don't hesitate to interrupt with any questions.
So I will start with some background information,
and it is just a classical problem of rotational motion
of incompressible fluids.
There's a problem with a free surface, so-called Stokes wave.
As I said, I'm very interested in the stability
of periodic or solitary waves.
And the fluid mechanics equations earlier
equations seems to be a little bit complicated,
because they combine the Hamiltonian dynamics
on a free surface with elliptic PDEs for the velocity
potential coupled together.
And therefore, the main question is
how to get nonlinear evolution equations close to describe
this Hamiltonian dynamics.
And from very long ago, some applied PDEs
were derived in this context, in particular,
for long, small amplitude waves.
So the wavelength is much larger than the depth of the fluid,
and the amplitude is much smaller
than the depth of the fluid.
And of course, the list of PDEs would
start with a classical Cartovac-Duris equation,
which is an evolutionary equation,
first order derivative in time, dispersive here,
and convective nonlinearity.
And it was derived long, long, long ago,
and it was used for existence and stability of solitary waves
and periodic waves.
Different equation was derived not so long ago,
only 50 years ago, much shorter compared to KDV equation,
and it was a regularized KDV, or PBM equation.
The only difference here appears to be in the dispersive term.
20 years later, another PDE was derived by Camas and Hall.
And if you look at the left-hand side,
it is just the BBM equation.
But it's modified with some quadratic nonlinearity
and cubic derivatives here.
And in fact, this equation was rigorously justified,
as well as all other equations were rigorously justified
in the context of fluids.
So now I will start my talk with the comparison
of the state of the art and the existence and stability
theory for periodic and solitary wave solutions
for these three equations.
For KDV and BBM, they share common features, solutions
of initial-value problem exist in the sobular space H1.
And in this sobular space, the energy and momentum
function are well defined.
That makes it energy space, which is very good,
conserved in time.
And the traveling wave solutions can be found effectively
from an ODE.
And the study of this ODE shows that all traveling wave
solutions have smooth profiles in the admissible range
of the wave speeds.
And moreover, these traveling waves
becomes constrained minimizers of the energy
subject of momentum.
Then by working with the Lyapunov theory of stability,
we can prove that because this is constrained minimizers
of energies, the traveling waves are
arbitrarily stable in the energy space H1
for which solutions of the initial-value problem
are well defined.
And so in this theory, the original theory,
there are only smooth waves.
While in fluids, we know in earlier equations,
there are also some picked waves or even waves
with singularity.
And if we look now at what Kamasa-Holm equation can offer,
in fact, it can offer not only smooth waves,
but also the waves with singularity.
For Kamasa-Holm equation, we have
to be a little bit careful with solutions
of the initial-value problem.
And it turns out that one need to control the slopes,
the first derivative of the solutions
in order to get local well postness in the space H1
with bounded slopes.
If you look at the traveling waves,
then we will find intervals for parameters for which waves
are smooth and intervals for parameters for which the waves
are picked or cast.
These are two types of singularity.
For pick, it's a finite jump of the first derivative.
The first derivative is still bounded.
For cast, it's an infinite jump of the first derivative.
So the first derivative is unbounded.
Both coexist, smooth and picked.
And both smooth and picked waves are still constrained
minimizers of energy.
The energy is still defined in the space of H1.
However, we are now lacking local well postness in H1.
We need to control the slopes in the time evolution.
Because of that, we have to be very careful with stability
analysis.
For the waves with smooth profile,
it was proven that the waves are still stable
because there is a momentum density which
can be used to control the slopes for the waves
with the smooth profiles.
But for the waves with picked profiles,
they are unstable in the time evolution.
The perturbations do not grow in H1
because of this constrained minimization properties.
But the perturbations do grow in W1 infinity.
And that makes the profile unstable.
So as a summary of what this Camasso-Holm equation can offer,
it's a cartoon here with admissible range
of the velocities for which smooth waves exist,
something like waves with such nice profiles,
intervals for which cast wave exists,
the waves with infinite singularity for the slopes,
for the first derivative.
And then in between, there is a point
for which the wave is picked.
There is a singularity, but it's not strong.
The first derivative just jumps by finite number here.
And that's the state of the art for the Camasso-Holm equation.
Now, if you want to go away from these nonlinear PDEs
and think about the original problems,
the earlier equations, the stock's wave,
then obviously we know that there are smooth waves
and there are picked waves.
Stocks himself predicted existence of the pick wave
is 120 degrees at the crest here.
And the existence of such solutions was proven
by Toland and his collaborators.
The existence of this precise 2 pi over 3 picked singularity
was proven by Plotnikov.
But if you want to approximate
or to understand stability problems
related to such picked profiles,
then we would be running into the troubles
and even approximation of such solutions
would be a troublesome.
And so here I refer to some pictures
from the paper of Sergei Dijenko, Pavel Uzhnikov
and Korotkevich, Alexander Korotkevich,
where they studied approximations
of these traveling wave solutions
by using conformal coordinate,
by using the formulas,
which will be the main item in my talk.
And the smooth waves could be well
or very approximated by Fourier series,
but unfortunately it is very hard
to get close to the picked wave.
There is always some distance from reaching the pick wave.
If you look at how the velocity depends
on the steepness of the wave,
the picture is also quite confusing.
It starts very good monotonic function,
but then it reaches the maximum point
and then it's not clear whether it's oscillate
or just wind around here,
but definitely there is at least one fault point here.
And so this was the numerical results obtained
before reaching the picked status
and there are no results for the picked solutions.
Recently Anastasia and Sergei Dechenko
studied a lot in stability of such solid stocks waves
by using numerical methods and this is quite good.
And so from the beginning,
I would like to say that I will be looking
at the periodic waves
and I will be thinking about the stability problem
with respect to periodic perturbations of the same period.
It eliminates the problem of modulational stability
and I was very happy to see that recently
the subject was booming
with the proofs of modulational stability
by using different techniques.
And so these four groups,
including the group of Garnard here.
And the point here to make is that these four groups
used four different techniques
to study modulational stability for stocks waves
and only in the limit when the stocks waves
has small amplitude.
So it eliminates immediately as the picked waves.
What I wanted to mention is that we are going to work
with the formalism which is neither in the list,
not in the list.
We are going to work with the formalism
based still on conformal transformations
or something similar to the work of Walter Strauss
but with some modifications.
And so the objective of our work
is to inspect a closed system of nonlinear evolution equations
which we can obtain here to eliminate elliptic part
of the problem and reduce it to Hamiltonian dynamics.
And we will be particularly interested
to understand transition from the smooth
to single or traveling wave solutions,
periodic wave solutions,
and also to understand analytically stability
of the periodic waves.
So the system of equations we haven't been exploring
is a generalization of what is called Babenki equation.
And it was derived about 30 years ago,
40 years ago, in the context of earlier equations
and it is using conformal transformation method.
So the starting part is classical.
We have the free surface profile here,
the velocity potential which is defined in the fluid domain
with a periodic boundary condition in the next direction,
flat bottom at the bottom,
and then the free surface here at the top,
Neumann boundary conditions at the flat bottom,
and on the top we have this dynamical and kinematical
or kinematic and dynamic condition.
One important thing here is that in order to make sense
of the depths, we need to do some kind of normalization
and now normalization will be the zero mean constraint here.
Now, with conformal transformation,
we think about mapping the fluid domain to a rectangle,
and the transformation is supposed to be given expressed
in terms of holomorphic function,
so that for really imaginary parts of holomorphic function
would satisfy Kashi Riemann equation.
The domain here in the W plane becomes a rectangle
which we particularly like
because we can use separation of variables and PDE techniques
to solve this elliptic part of the problem explicitly.
We would do still periodic boundary conditions
here in the horizontal direction.
We would do Neumann boundary conditions
both for the potentials
and also for the X part of the mapping.
And we would have to define a little bit
the depth of the fluid here, H,
that's the depth of the fluid in W coordinate variable,
it may be different from H zero.
The difference is the mean value of the free surface.
But once we have separation of variables,
we know how to solve this kind of problems.
And so here we can see here the difference
between the two depths,
which would be the mean value of the free surface here.
We can do the same thing for the velocity potential
because Laplace equation is invariant
under conformal transformation,
so it's still the same kind of problem
for the velocity potential.
And with this formalism,
we will define two canonical variables.
One is for the velocity potential at the top surface
and the other one is the free surface
which is now mapped at the top surface in the W plane,
psi and eta variables.
And as it was derived 30 years ago,
these equations are closed
and they look like these two equations
for the free surface and for the velocity potential.
So in fact, the derivation can be found
in the papers of Alexander Giacienko,
Kuznetsov's spectra Zaharov
and many other papers around this time.
We particularly like the derivation and appendix
of the paper of Sergei Titch
and Kuznetsov and Karatkevich here.
And we have followed these derivations
to check that it's all consistent and correct.
And so if we think, if you look at these equations,
then they are local with respect to time,
which is a good thing.
It's a little bit quadratic here with respect to time,
which makes it slightly more complicated
that what we want to.
But they're still non-local
with respect to the spatial variable.
Here's a non-local operator,
is a multiplicative operator in a Fourier domain
and it just express the wave dispersion.
So for example here, the TENCH can be seen here
as a mapping from X to Y variable.
And that's expressed by the operator T.
Obviously, this operator is not invertible.
However, it gives a zero mean value
for the periodic function when it acts.
And so if we restrict our consideration
to periodic functions with zero mean,
then we can invert this operator,
but then there will be zero value
for the mean value of this inverse operator.
Both operators are skewed joint in L2 spaces
and with this inverse operator, with derivative,
it becomes self-adjoint operator,
which is one of the most important operators
of this water wave theory with a Fourier symbol and code 10.
So here, of course, the equations
are slightly more complicated,
but still they can be analyzed.
In particular, we can think about conserved quantities
and we can think about traveling wave solutions
to simplify these equations greatly.
So first for about conserved quantities,
since we had this zero mean constraint in physical variable
and there is now transformation variable involved,
this constraint maps to a quadratic constraint
on the mean value for the free surface
in the new variable U.
But both parts of this quadratic constraint
is our constants of motion
and the right additional constants of motions,
in particular, the last one is the Hamiltonian,
the full energy of a water wave problem,
it's encoded here.
Now, if we think about traveling wave solutions,
these equations becomes particularly nice.
For the traveling wave solutions,
the quadratic part of the first equation cancels out
and we have a local linear relation
between the potential, velocity potential
and the free surface.
And if you substitute this relation to the second equation,
it becomes what is known as a Babenke equation.
I like the form of Babenke equation in this way,
that the left-hand side is just a linear operator,
self-adjoint operator here,
and the right-hand side is just a quadratic
non-local operator expressed by the same k.
And the problem is Hamiltonian,
so it can be formulated from the least action principle
from the variational derivative of the energy function.
If we want to study existence,
then we need to solve this equation
and both smooth and picked traveling ways,
as opposed to give us profiles satisfying this equation.
If you want stability,
then we need to linearize this non-linear equation
and get a linearized operator,
which is a self-adjoint operator in a L2 space.
And this is like a Hessian of the energy functionals
defined at this profile of the traveling way solution.
If you want linearized evolution of these problems,
this is the second of the problems,
the linearized evolution will give us a quadratic pencil
related to this self-adjoint operator,
which is slightly more complicated than what we want.
And therefore, our first step was maybe to approach
to this subject to think about the ways to simplify,
to think about the toy problem.
And so the idea of the toy problem,
which I'm going to present during my talk today,
is to explore this traveling wave coordinate
and to explore this kind of linear relationship
between the two variables
with the deviation here, hidden in zeta variable.
The first equation is invariant
after this transformation in zeta variables and eta variables.
And the second equation, which was long, remains long.
However, in this long second equation,
we can see a remarkable structure,
which is placed here in a frame, in a box.
First, we see all the terms of the Babenka equation,
which will define profile of the traveling wave
without any truncation.
And we can see the first or the evolution,
which is closed on the same surface elevation variable
as the Babenka equation.
And so the toy problem, which I'm presenting now,
is that we can just cut out these discrepancies,
this deviation variable zeta,
completely neglect the first equation,
cut out this path from the second equation,
and consider the problem, which is framed here in the box.
And that's what is our toy model.
And I'm going to simplify this toy model even more
in order to be able to solve both existence
and stability problem in a full analysis glory
without any numerical approximation.
And so this is the path where I will work
with this toy model.
So again, just one equation instead of two,
which still keeps the same squared joint operator here
in front of the time evolution, time derivative.
And it keeps the Babenka equation
with a self-adjoint operator here, cage.
So now, as I promised,
I would like to think about the shallow water limit
when I can replace this non-local model
with something like a non-linear PD to be able to study it.
And one remarkable equation,
which comes immediately in the memory,
is a question which is called intermediate long-quave equation,
which is one of the models of integrable problems,
integrable systems.
And that problem has a very similar non-local operator K,
with only difference that the mean value was non-zero,
but was augmented in the same way,
that it's the same as the limit of n going to zero
for all other four emotes.
Such that this operator can be expanded
in a shallow water limit to be just identity,
plus second order derivative operator,
and the identity here is removed
by the Galilean transformation
in a reference frame moving with the limiting wave speed,
so that we have reductions
of the intermediate long-quave equation
to the KDV equation.
So here, in our operator KH,
we already have zero mean, we don't have to remove it,
but the idea of the toy problem
that we are going to remove the limiting values
for all other Fourier coefficients, subtract them out,
such that the leading order
will be just the second order derivative equation,
so that this non-local problem is replaced by the PD.
So I don't claim that there is a rigorous procedure
involved here, it is basically a toy model
where we can give a full mathematical analysis
of the PD involved, in particular thinking overshoot
beyond the smooth waves towards to the picked wave
and cast wave, but if it offers something significant
then maybe we can re-inspect the original problem
and think if the same phenomena is available
in the full water wave problem
without this interesting trick.
So if you think about this local PDE,
then it shares all the properties
of the original water wave equation.
It has the same constraint,
which is the zero mean constraint in the original variable.
Now it's expressed in terms of the local operator here.
Both parts of these constraints are constant of motion.
In addition, there is a Hamiltonian
which is also constant of motion,
and all these quantities are not very far
from the conserved quantities of the commasohol equation.
So what we achieved here by doing this kind of a toy model
that we are at the level when it is not a KDV theory,
but more like a level of commasohol theory
with the quantities defined like this.
So here in the main part of my talk,
I'm going to present two main results
on this local model, which we derived in this way.
Actually, three main results.
The first result is about initial value problem.
You think about initial value problem
and there is still no locality involved here.
The derivative in spatial variable applies to the left.
That's the big, yes?
On your previous slide.
So you have the constraint.
So both, as you said,
both parts of that are conserved quantities.
The second one's clearly positive.
Yes.
So in the toy model, you don't have
that the average of eta is zero anymore.
In fact, it's strictly negative
because this is a positive quantity.
So we have this mean constraint
which comes from a regional mean
in terms of the integral of eta with respect to x.
And now because of the chain rule transformation,
it becomes this additional quadratic constraint.
So from here, the mean value is constant in time,
but it's always equal negative
to this positive quantity here,
which could be considered to be momentum.
So mass, momentum and energy is the same
terminology as we used to do in KDV theory.
But in addition to this, there is a non locality involved
because there is still derivative here
which we need to invert.
And in order to comply, in order to resist inversion,
we have the zero mean constraint.
So it's not zero mean constraints.
We have this non-linear constraint, right?
Okay, thank you.
Okay, great.
And so I want to just to show
that the origin of this non locality
which is still remaining in this problem,
that's because of this operator TH.
KH is TH derivative.
So if KH is replaced by second derivative,
TH inverse is supposed to be replaced
by first order derivative.
And that's how it appears to be in the problem.
But the good stuff is that since this quantity has zero mean,
I can use projection operator to the subspace
of L2 functions with zero mean.
And on this subspace, I can invert the derivative,
obviously the Fourier series inversion.
And I can define uniquely the anti-derivative
to have also zero mean.
In which case we have conserved quantity for eta,
conserved quantity for derivative of eta squared
and the additional zero constraint here.
In this evolutionary form,
we can prove well-posed theory quite easily
because the right-hand side is the sum of two parts.
The first part is local
and it is inviscid burglarous equations,
solutions of which are well-defined by characteristics
in the space of H1 with the bounded slopes.
That's so the burglarous equation,
we always have to control the slopes.
And this is a non-local part, the second part,
it's a bounded operator on every bounded subset
in that space as well.
And so by using kind of method of characteristic
BLML principle, we can immediately end up
with a local well-posedness in H1 space
intersecting with the bounded slopes, bounded first derivatives.
And that's a space which makes sense for picked wave
and for smooth waves,
but maybe not so much for casped wave
if you want to consider evolution of the casped wave.
Now, if you think about traveling wave solution,
we don't have to use traveling wave coordinate anymore,
it was already done before.
And we have very explicitly the parameter
for the speed of the traveling wave here encoded.
What we have instead is the ODE,
ODE for time-independent solution of the story model.
And that is a nice ODE which can be fully solved,
fully studied, and the main principle result
which I wanted to show is precisely this existence theory.
The periodic waves with a normalized period of two pi,
we always do two pi here for the normalization of the period,
bifurcate from the unit value of the wave speed C.
In that limit, the L infinity norm of the solution goes to zero.
And then it always bifurcate to the right
of this limiting wave speed.
And there exists another remarkable value C star
here given explicitly for which the wave remains smooth.
Past the value C star,
in fact, there is a non-empty interval of wave speeds
for which the wave is continuous,
but the first derivative is singular.
It's a strongly singular with infinite jump
of the first derivative.
And more precisely, it has a very precise
asymptotic expansion to be exactly mod U2 short
as comes from the ODE shield.
And so if we want maybe to illustrate this with pictures,
here they are.
If we increment the speed parameter,
then the small amplitude wave becomes strongly non-linear
and approaches, in our theory,
it approaches without any problems to the picked wave.
We have no any problems, any discrepancies here.
And then the dotted line,
a dust line shows the picked wave
with the finite jump of the slope.
And then past this peak wave,
there is a family of cast wave
with infinite jump of the slopes.
And the waves exist still
in the non-empty interval of wave speeds.
So this precisely confirm or maybe generalize,
or maybe just give another example
of the phenomena I was talking about
when I was reviewing Kamasa-Holne equation.
The interval of wave speeds
for which smooth waves exist,
interval of wave speeds for which cast wave exist,
and then a very particular border point
for which the wave is picked.
In fact, it exists in a very explicit way
as a parabolic profile.
For that precise wave speed.
So it's just for one wave speed, it is parabolic profile.
What is interesting and may attract some attention
that if we think about the highest,
the maximal height of the wave,
then for all cast waves,
the maximal height happen exactly at one half C squared,
which is Bernoulli law.
It comes from Bernoulli law of higher dynamics.
Waves of the maximal height
should have one half C squared at the maximum value.
Another remarkable thing is this behavior
of u to the power two-third.
Since u is the variable in W plane,
and we use this analytical transformation,
conformal mapping,
but which is not fully conformal now
because there is a singularity involved.
Still the singularity is unfolded
precisely to give us a peak with 120 degrees.
And so here for the first time,
we can see that maybe such things
like a cast wave, like a stock-speaked wave
in the original earlier equations
exists not just for one particular limiting wave speed,
but for the whole range of the wave speeds.
And the border point, it's not clear what it is sent
to by conformal transformation.
What is the border point
which separates the family of smooth waves
from the family of singular waves?
Maybe it's the artifact of the toy model,
but maybe it exists in one just to study
more attentively earlier equations
in this Babenka formulation.
And so I will give a little bit of details,
not much about how this result can be proven.
In fact, it's just ODE theory.
We are lucky to have Hamiltonian ODE
from Hamiltonian PDE,
so it says there is a first-order invariant.
And with this first-order invariant,
we know that all orbits of ODE,
they are level curves of this function of two variables.
With smooth curves existing inside of separatrix loop,
they give us smooth periodic waves.
And cast waves exist outside, it's a singular waves.
And this parabolic wave, the peak wave
is just a separatrix curve.
One important ingredient of the theory for ODE
on a phase plane is the period function.
That's the duration of the period of this free surface.
And it is a function of the parameter C,
but also a function of this level,
constant level for the first-order invariant.
And most important thing that it is monotonic.
It is monotonically increasing with respect to C.
And it is monotonically decreasing
with respect to this level E,
at least vision the family of the smooth waves
and slightly beyond the family of the smooth waves.
So in fact, in order to illustrate this,
I will just give a picture here from E0,
that's from the center point,
the period function is monotonically decreasing,
passes this limiting peak wave,
still monotonically decreasing
until it reaches a global minimum and then it increases.
And so if you want to identify
how many two pi periodic solutions exist,
what we have to do is just to find a root
of this period function at the level two pi.
And the other dotted curve shows the same period function
for larger values of C to show that it's indeed
monotonically increasing with respect to C.
So with this, we have the existence diagram completely.
The family of smooth wave exists between the black points.
The family of cast wave exists between black point
and the red point.
And there is one more family here,
the cast, the singular family,
which we completely ignore
because it doesn't bifurcate from the linear limit.
So we don't need to worry about it.
And so with the same kind of analysis,
we can see the relevance of the picked wave.
The singularity is canceled here in the quadrature
and the secondary derivative is in fact constant.
So it's a parabolic profile wave.
And then if the value of the level E is above
the critical level, then the singularity is not canceled.
And from that singularity by very elementary analysis,
we can get back this law of U to the power two third.
So with this, I'm going to present
the last important result,
which I have for the toy model
is a full understanding of stability,
at least for the smooth and for the picked wave.
So for the stability analysis,
we would think about something like adding a perturbation
to the profile.
Remember that I cut out quadratic eigenvalue problem
and now it becomes a linear eigenvalue problem.
Or in other words, first order with respect to time evolution
is well defined here by linearized Bobenka operator,
which is here, self-adjoint operator.
Then we have this constraint of the theory,
which gives us a proper orthogonality
of the perturbation to this local path.
So that's anti-derivative is again well defined.
But because we have conservation quantity for this,
we can always complement with two constraints.
So requiring both the mean value to be just zero
and perturbation to be orthogonal
to the second derivative just zero.
And that's just to fixed mass and the fixed momentum,
the same concept which is very useful
in the orbital stability theory.
With this, we have the following theory.
For the entire family of the smooth periodic waves,
we are guaranteeing linear orbital stability,
meaning that for any initial data H1 with these two constraints,
there exists a unique solution staying in H1,
such that this unique solution
is not growing relative to the translation
of the original periodic wave.
So this is a derivative with respect to space.
It's a translational mode.
And the translational mode is controllable.
It can grow faster than the linear function,
but then the perturbation is defined relative
to this translational mode,
which is very typical for the orbital stability concept.
The idea of, okay, before that a few remarks are in order.
So first of all, we can do spectral stability
with the same level.
Linear stability, in fact,
implies spectral stability here.
For spectral stability,
we would have an eigenvalue problem
and the entire spectrum is a subset
of a purely imaginary line.
What is interesting about this problem
is that if we now differentiate this,
we can reformulate it in the form
which appears in the work of Stanislav and Stefanov in 2016.
I think they were looking at the different examples,
but now with this toy model,
we have a very natural example
for applications of this stability theory
for this strange interesting eigenvalue problem.
On the other hand,
linear stability doesn't apply non-linear stability
because we are using energy quantity
to control perturbations in H1,
like it was here in the theorem,
the norms of H1 given.
While the slopes are not controllable from the energy.
And I don't know any momentum quantity
which could be useful here to control the slopes.
If it exists, then we can upgrade it
for the non-linear stability analysis,
but so far I'm not no luck.
Then I think I can prove also instability
of the piqued wave by using the ideas
we were developing very recently
in the context of other fluid models,
but so far we have not written this part up.
But what is interesting is that
if you are really interested in stability
of the singular wave,
the cusp wave is the slope u to the power of two-third,
then there is no theory which can be applied to those
because the cusp wave doesn't exist
in the space of H1 with bounded slopes.
And therefore, well-possessed is lacking
in order to identify,
to even understand stability of cusp wave.
So here I will just mention a little bit
of how easy to prove the stability theory
if we have such nice toy model as we have here.
In fact, what we have to do is to operate
with the energy quadratic form
which is related to the self-adjoint operator
as some of the two terms here.
It's a constant with respect to the time evolution.
If it is positive definite,
we have immediately lelepon of stability theory.
Unfortunately, it's not positive definite,
but the spectrum of it can be fully understood.
First of all, it's a Sturm-Leuville type problem
in the periodic domain.
The spectrum is purely point consistent
of isolated eigenvalues,
zero in the spectrum because of translational mode.
But the second homogeneous solution of this operator
is given precisely by the derivative of the family
with respect to this level of energy,
the level of the first order invariant
used in existence here.
And so, since this is not too high periodic,
we know that zero is a simple eigenvalue,
but also from the monotonicity of this quantity,
we have immediately the theorem,
criterion to guarantee existence
of two negative eigenvalues in the spectrum.
So, if you go back to the quadratic form,
no, there are two negative eigenvalues,
so we cannot use it as a lelepon of function.
But there are two constraints
which are fixed mass and fixed momentum.
And with these two constraints,
by simple calculus for the constraint spaces,
we can prove that the operator has no negative eigenvalue
and has a simple zero eigenvalue.
The criteria for which is the monotonicity of the mass,
it should be monotonically decreasing.
But this is, in fact, we can prove again,
body theory can be used to prove it rigorously.
This numerics just illustrate monotonicity of the mass
with respect to mass is negative
and it's monotonically decreasing to the negative side.
And it's valid for the entire family of the smooth waves.
And so with this, then the rest is just a decomposition.
So initial data is supposed to be orthogonal
to two constraints.
And then we decompose it in a neutral mode
and the remainder term and require the generality
of the remainder term to the neutral mode.
Then now quadratic form is fully coercive
with respect to this perturbation.
And quadratic form is conserved in time
and quadratic form is bounded in the space of H1
from which we immediately have H1 stability bound
of the linear theorem.
And so with this, I think I finished my part
on the toy model and then the rest of my time,
I can explain some other exciting features
of this Babenki equation and maybe linearization,
a linearized Babenki equation outside of the toy model.
So I'm back to the Babenki equation
in a full, with a full dispersion here.
And we can inspect, we can inspect, of course,
this Babenki equation for any H,
but because it's an undergraduate project,
it had limited time.
So we inspected this Babenki equation
in the deep water limit.
It is a non-local equation in the deep water limit,
but non-locality is a sort of well-known,
it's the derivative and Hilbert transform,
which is very well-defined with respect to Fourier series.
So in this model, one, the model can be rewritten
in this case, in this way.
And one of the first result would be immediately
a small amplitude expansion.
It's always the first result I try
when I have periodic waves.
In this way, we can immediately illustrate
this bifurcation from the unit speed C,
bifurcation to the right with the amplitude
of the wave here, quadratically expanding.
And apparently this result was written back to 1880.
So it's the old result from the time of stocks.
What is more interesting is to think
about the limiting wave.
So to think about the cast wave for which eta
reaches the highest, the maximal height at 1 half c squared.
In this way, I found interesting to rewrite the problem
with respect to deviation from this maximal height.
The deviation will be zeta,
will be positive definite quantity.
And when we do this, we are canceling
the non-local linear part of the problem.
That's a remarkable phenomenon.
So as a result, the entire Babenka equation
can be written as a fixed point equation.
Zeta is equal to a certain operator
which is just defined in terms of a quadratic part
with plus some constant.
And so from analysis of this equation,
we can prove couple of results
which are sort of well-agreed with a well-known theory,
asymptotic theory.
But I think these results were never derived
by using Babenka equation.
The first result is the following.
If we think about the wave being single
in a fractional way, alpha is between zero and one,
then we shall try to inspect what kind of powers of alpha
this fixed point equation admits.
And we can prove that this fixed point equation
admits only one power of alpha
which is exactly two-third.
No other powers of alpha are admitted
by this fixed point equation around the peak,
around the singularity.
And that is apparently in agreement
with all the results I already mentioned.
But then we can go further.
We can think, okay, if the wave is a single
and we had a perturbation which should be smoother than this,
but still in a fractional power,
something between two-third and two,
then can we find a very precise value for beta
for which the perturbation is defined?
And then in this way,
we can derive the following transcendental equation
which coincide explicitly with the equation derived
by Grant by using Euler equation.
At that time, 73, Grant did not use Babenka equation.
So we have effectively recovered exactly the same equation
as in a Grant paper,
but simply by analyzing all admissible singular solutions
of this Babenka equation.
So unfortunately in that theory,
neither constant could be well-defined.
A, B, and even the C here in the equation,
C cannot be uniquely defined.
They are defined from an unlocal problem.
So the singularity analysis
which is sufficient to identify correct powers
are not capable to give us a very explicit formula
for A, B, or for C.
Other things we can think is about linearization
and stability theory.
The linearized Babenka equation
is still a self-adjoint operator.
And here, if we are in the small amplitude expansion case,
we immediately see that this operator
is close to a constant coefficient operator
with spectrum being given by Fourier modes.
Zero Fourier mode is located
at negative eigenvalue negative one.
First Fourier modes cosine and sine
give double eigenvalues zero,
higher Fourier modes give positive eigenvalues.
So if you now bifurcate from this limit
along the family of periodic wave solutions,
then the zero eigenvalue is split
and it remains as a simple zero eigenvalue
because of translational symmetry,
but it also generates small negative eigenvalue.
And this value isn't precisely in agreement
with numerical results published in the paper,
Sergei Dechenkin, and so on.
And so this is also quite good.
Figure eight for modulation stability.
I said that I'm not going to do it,
but in fact, it was the first thing which we recovered
by using the Banke equation
and this second-order time evolution equation
by using exactly the same ideas and expansions.
In fact, this figure eight is related to the Fourier modes
which sit here and split to the negative eigenvalue.
And so our slopes here in a full agreement
with the recent results,
and I think the recent results
are just justification of some old results.
So with this, I think I will finish my talk.
I think it's the right time with a short summary.
So I'm sailing today this toy model
which is the first-order evolution equation
closed for the surface elevation
as a truncation of the second-order evolution equation.
It has exactly the same solutions as the traveling waves
and it makes stability analysis extremely simple
because it reduces to the linear eigenvalue problem
instead of quadratic eigenvalue problem.
Again, justification of this toy model is questionable.
We have not thought about it,
but it's quite promising model in a full glory
with a full dispersion.
But in addition to this in this toy model
for the shallow water limit,
we have main results that continuous families exist
not only for smooth waves, but also for cast waves
separated by single picked wave in W plane, right?
In a pre-image plane compared to the physical domain.
The smooth waves are linearly stable
in the time evolution.
Picked wave is linearly unstable.
No results for cast wave could be
unless we can push up the well-possessed theory.
And the well-possessed theory is well-formulated
in the same space as weak theory for Kamasa Hall equation.
So thank you very much for your attention.
Okay, let me start with this demo.
