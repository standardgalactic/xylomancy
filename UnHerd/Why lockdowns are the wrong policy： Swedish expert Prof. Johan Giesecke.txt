Hello and welcome. Thanks for tuning in. You are watching Lockdown TV. This is the pop-up news
and discussion program from Unheard. Throughout the lockdown weeks, we have been bringing
conversations and interesting people together to work out what's going on and how we should
be thinking about this current crisis. I'm delighted that today we are joined down the line from
Sweden by Dr Johan Giseke. Dr Giseke, thank you so much for making the time today.
My pleasure. If I can give you, you helped me a little bit here, but you trained originally at
the London School of Tropical Medicine. Is that right? No, it started before that. I used to be
an infectious disease clinical doctor and worked a lot with AIDS patients during the 1980s.
And that's what put me into epidemiology. And then I spent one year or two years at the
London School of Tropical Medicine in the early 90s. And then I came back to Sweden and then I
became state epidemiologist for Sweden, which means having control over all infectious diseases.
Which is the job that Anders Tegnell currently has? So I actually hired him 20 years ago and
then I was his boss and now he's my boss, but he's working actually quite well.
And you then became chief scientist at the European Center for Disease Control?
Yep. And what roles do you have now? Who are you advising at the moment?
I'm advising Anders Tegnell at the Swedish Agency for Public Health on a consultant
basis. I'm retired really, so I'm doing this mostly because it's fun.
And the World Health Organization? You were also saying you were on a call with them
earlier today. Do you have an ongoing relationship with them?
Yes, I'm advising the Director General together with a group of old scientists,
but that's an unpaid, it's just an honorary post in a way.
So having how, as it were, established your credentials to talk with confidence on this topic.
There's been a lot of confused thinking and a lot of confusion about what the correct response
to a threat such as COVID-19 should be. And I just wanted to begin by getting your kind of
summary thoughts of how Sweden is differing from other countries and why you think that is.
The main reason is that we or the Swedish government decided early in January that the
measures we should take against the pandemic should be evidence-based. And when you start
looking around for the measures out of being taken now by different countries, you find that very few
of them have the shred of evidence base. But one we know that's known for 150 years or more,
and that is washing your hands is good for you and good for others when you're in the epidemic.
But the rest, like border closures, school closures, social distancing,
there's almost no science behind most of these.
So what is the current policy in Sweden? Social distancing is part of the policy,
isn't it? What is the regime that Sweden has gone with?
The main difference to other countries is that you're not locked up in your home.
If you go out to buy food or groceries or drugs, I mean medicines,
there's no police to stop you in the street and ask you what you're doing here.
People are asked to stay inside, but there's no reinforcement or enforcement of that.
And people do it anyway. So that's one.
We have the rule that a crowd cannot be bigger than 50 people.
So I can still have an event for 49 people? Yes, I want.
You could. And the schools, the upper schools are closed, secondary education,
manual overseas, closed schools up to age 15, 16 are open.
What more do we have? The nursing homes or houses for old people are closed to visitors.
So it sounds like it's a moderate social distancing regime then at the moment.
It is. Sorry, it's very similar to the one that the UK had before there was a famous paper
in by the Imperial College by the modellers who made models for infectious diseases that came out
on the day after you made a U-turn in England. Yeah, so tell us about that. So the original
strategy in the UK became known as a kind of herd immunity strategy, that's what it was called.
And before we come on to talk about the Imperial model, which I would like to talk about,
is it correct to call it herd immunity? And is that the Swedish strategy?
It's not a strategy, but it's a byproduct of the strategy. But the strategy is to protect the old
and the frail, try to minimize their risk of becoming infected and taking care of them if
they get infected. And if you do that the way we're doing it, you would probably get herd immunity
in the end, but that's a byproduct or it's not the main reason to do it. So you were saying then,
so the initial UK response seemed to be similar to what Sweden is doing now and you thought that
was better? Yeah, no, I think it was very good actually. And we were very pleased we were having
the same policy as the UK that gave some credibility to what we were doing. But then
Mr Johnson made his 180 degree turn. Yeah, so why there may have been other political factors
involved. He was definitely under a lot of pressure because lots of European countries were doing a
formal lockdown at that point. But the turning point did seem to be that in Imperial College
report which forecasts 510,000 deaths in the UK with a completely unmitigated approach,
250,000 deaths with a mitigated approach, which is roughly equivalent to what you're doing in
Sweden. And then it suggests that it might be as few as 20,000 if we did a full suppression or
lockdown. What was your impression of that paper? I think it's not very good. And the
thing that they miss a little is any models for infectious disease spread are very popular. Many
people do them. They're good for teaching. They seldom tell you the truth because I make a small
parenthesis which model could have assumed that the outbreak would start in northern Italy in
Europe. Difficult to model that one. And any such model, it looks complicated. There are strange
mathematical formula and integral signs and stuff. But it rests on the assumptions and the
assumptions in that article would be heavily criticized for. I won't go through that. It would
take you the rest of your day if I went through them all. The paper was never published scientifically.
It's not peer reviewed, which your scientific paper should be. It's just an internal departmental
report from Imperial. And it's fascinating. I don't think any other scientific endeavor has made
such an impression on the world as that rather debatable paper. Is your impression that it was
overly pessimistic? Yes, very much so. I guess it comes down to some degree of speculation, but
what's your impression of how serious the disease is? And what kind of fatalities we would be looking
at if we had a more moderate or more mitigated approach? What's the number of deaths in the UK
now? I don't know. 13,000. So you're getting close to 20 now. But probably not 510,000.
I think, oh, well, let me back one step. One thing that the model has missed is that it assumes that
the hospital capacity will remain the same. And that's not what's happening anywhere. I mean,
in Sweden, we've tripled our intensive care capacity. And I think that's happening in the UK as well.
But the paper completely overlooks that. It's set as a static thing.
But so just to sort of come back on this, the argument what people watching will be asking,
and I think what most people who support the lockdown would say, and that is the overwhelming
majority of people in politics and in the media, is that the reason the curve is now flattening
and that the numbers of deaths are gradually coming down on a daily basis is because of the
lockdown. And that shows that the policy has worked. And Professor Neil Ferguson,
who led the Imperial Paper, suggests that he stands by his prediction that 500,000 dog people
would have died had that not taken place. So if it wasn't the lockdown that has been flattening
our curve, what else could it have been? One thing is immunity. The other is that
the people who are frail and old will die first. And when that group of people is sort of thinned
out, you will get less deaths as well. The other thing is that when you start your exit strategy,
that's the favorite word now in all this public effort, the exit strategy. When you start that
one, you will have some other deaths that we had already. Yes. So I mean, does that mean then that
as the disease passes through the population, are we going to see
second and third spikes now after this? It will be part of the exit strategy because the only way
to check that if you're taking away one restriction, let's say we'll open the schools again, as an
example. How do you evaluate that? You have to see, ooh, numbers are going up again. More people
are dying. We have to stop that. We have pulled back that softening and try another. That's what
exit strategy will be in all countries. Countries will ease up a little on a restriction, see what
happens over the next two, three weeks. Ooh, it didn't work very well. We resume that. We try another
restriction. We list that one. Ooh, it worked. And so this is every country will have to do it that way.
And that means that the increasing number of deaths will be part of checking which strategy
should be kept and not. So what should we be doing instead? Oh, you can't.
I remember when I first heard, which is now six weeks ago, about the different
draconic measures that were taken. I asked myself, how are they going to climb down from
that one? When will they open the schools again? What should be the criterion to open the schools?
Did anyone or the most strong and very decisive politicians in Europe think about how do we get
out of this when they introduced it? And I think that would be a problem for the UK as well.
So let's take as a comparison the neighboring countries in Scandinavia, because a lot of
people are sending around these charts that show that Denmark and Norway and Finland have had much
fewer deaths on a per capita basis. And Sweden, the rate is still climbing. And they take that as
proof, essentially, that the Sweden should have gone into a more draconian lockdown. What do you
say to those people? Well, first, it's not true for Denmark. Secondly, one important thing is that
Norway, the nursing homes in Norway are usually quite small, whereas the nursing homes in Sweden
are quite big with hundreds of people, which means that if you get the virus into one nursing home
in Norway, it will affect far fewer people than a big one. So that's part of the reason. It's not
all the reason. And for Finland, the epidemic never really took off there. They started their
measures before it had even started. But I think we should have this discussion a year from now.
Let's decide that. We do this on the 17th of April, 2021. I think that the difference between
countries will be quite small in the end. So that you don't think that the severity of
these intervening measures are going to make that much difference? No, I don't think so.
I think, actually, should I tell you what I really think? I almost never do this. I think what we're
seeing is a tsunami over usually quite my disease, which is sweeping over Europe. And some countries
do this, and some countries do that, and some countries don't do that. And in the end, there
will be very little difference. So when you say it's usually quite mild disease, what do you mean
by that? That most people who get it will never even notice they were infected. So does that mean
that you think the actual fatality rate of this disease is much lower than the numbers that have
been talked about? Much, much lower. So have you made any speculations as to what sort of
zone the real fatality rate might be in? I think it would be like a severe influenza
season, the same as which would be an order of 0.1 percent, maybe. So that would suggest,
then, for a country like the UK that is already heading towards 20,000 deaths,
that would suggest that millions, many millions of people have already had it.
Yes. And do you think that is also true in Sweden, then, that a substantial percentage
of the population has had it? Yep. I'm rather certain of that, actually. And when we get,
we don't have the tests, really, yet. As you know, you have these two kinds. You know this,
don't you? Two kinds of tests. One that tells that you have it now, and another one that tells
you that you had it at some point before, an immunity or serology test. And they are just
being developed, and they're just being employed. I know from discussions with friends in the UK
that you started last week with 3,500 such tests, and you were gone with eight in one week,
and then it would be about 8,000 per week. And when you get tests that show people that
had the disease, you'll see that most of them never even dreamt they had it.
But we don't have yet any effective antibody tests, I don't think.
You're right. But it's coming. But you're confident that we will get those tests?
Oh, yes. That's a matter of time. And so what sort of percentage of the population do you think
we will discover has had it once we get mass antibody testing in place?
At least half. In the United Kingdom, or do you mean in Sweden as well?
Both countries. So the whole sort of rationale for introducing these lockdowns across Europe
that has created such an unbelievable side effects and pretty much stopped the whole
world in its tracks, you believe is a misguided policy? And do you think it's doing more harm than
good? Yes, I think so. On the whole, I mean, if you listen, what I'm saying is that people who
will die a few months later are dying now. And that's taking months from their lives. So that's
maybe not nice. But comparing that to the effects of the lockdown, which may be, I mean,
what am I most afraid of? It's the dictatorial trends in Eastern Europe that Orban is now
dictator for Hungary forever. There's no finishing date. I think the same is popping up in other
countries. It may pop up in more established democracies as well. I think the ramifications
can be huge from this. We don't even start seeing them.
So you think the correct policy from the start, just to get this clear, should have been to shield
old and vulnerable groups? There we failed. Sweden failed. We were not
on our toes enough to really shield the old people. We should have banned visitors earlier.
And many of the people working in nursing homes are from other countries. They're
refugees or asylum seekers in Sweden. Their Swedish may not be perfect. They may not always be
understanding information that has been spread to the population. There are many things we could
have done better a couple of weeks or a couple of months ago. So at the point we are now,
what you're advocating then is we protect those groups better. And as far as the rest of the
population is concerned, we just allow it to pass through the population, essentially.
Essentially, yes. Which is, I mean, I know that it's now.
That's what's commonly understood by what we call the herd immunity strategy, basically.
Because obviously it's not just the old and frail. I mean, there are the people that should be
protected. But I don't think you can stop it. It's spreading. You can stop it for some time,
but then, I mean, countries that have been successful. South Korea is giving up now.
They can't maintain their policy. Taiwan, I don't know about Taiwan. They were quite successful.
Singapore, similar problem. So those countries that are held up as the most successful,
in some cases ones that totally managed to suppress the outbreak, you think that it's
just a question of delay. And actually, they won't be able to hold that back.
So how should we judge success then? It seems like numbers of deaths does seem like a fair
measure. But if you're saying that they're essentially deaths that are just going to happen
later, it will sound to some people like a slightly sort of cold-hearted approach,
I suppose, that if you're saying they're going to die anyway, so we should allow
the disease to take its path. I think a lot of people might feel that a government can't
sit back and do that. If now, having had this lockdown, we're headed towards 20,000 deaths.
How many deaths might we have had if we had had no lockdown? Would it have been more?
Yeah, probably a bit more. But in the end, the result will be rather much the same. And I agree
it's a bit careless to say that to let people. We're not saying that. We're saying protect the old,
try to slow the spread of the epidemic a bit so that the healthcare system will manage when we
have many sick people, many severely ill people. But it's more where I don't think you can't,
really. At some point, the tsunami is not bad. It will roll over Europe, no matter what you do.
And will, as it rolls over Europe sooner or later, will, presumably, treatments will improve.
We'll get better at knowing how to treat it. It already feels like the initial focus on
ventilation has shifted to other ideas and people are thinking of new ways to treat it.
Is that in itself not an argument for suppressing it as much?
But how long in a democracy do you think people have a lockdown? How long will it take before
people say, no, I'm not taking it? You can do it in China. In China, you can do it. You can tell
people to stay at home and you can weld back that door so they can't get out. But in a democracy,
you can't. And after three, four weeks, people will say, well, I don't know anyone who had the
COVID and I haven't met and I want to go out. I want to go down to the top.
And so how long do you think you could lock people up like this? Stay in your home? You need
a permit to go to the shop? We don't actually need a permit. But yeah, I mean, I think
we've now just had it extended by three weeks. There is an enormous amount of public support
for it. And that's one of the interesting factors about this, that at the moment,
the public is very much onside with the lockdown in the United Kingdom. Some people seem to like it.
So it may be that it's hard to persuade people to go back in some way. But
do you feel, Dr. Isiga, that the policies that have been put in place by the UK and by other
European governments, how did they come about? You've been a leading epidemiologist for your
whole career. You dealt with influencers and SARS and you advised the World Health Organization.
What was it about this pandemic that was so different that has led to this global shutdown?
New disease. A lot of people dying. You don't know really what will happen.
And this fear of contagion, I think, is almost genetic in people.
And showing political strength, decisiveness, force, very important for politicians.
Do you think the fact that it came out of China and we had witnessed such an enormous
response, quarantining whole provinces and so on, set the tone in some way and that that felt like
the appropriate response? Could be. Let's do like the Chinese. But again,
you can't compare to China. It's a different world. And do you think you could keep the lockdown to
protect the old people until we have good drugs and good vaccines? Six months a year, 18 months?
I think people would get a bit tired of it, even if they support the policy in the UK.
So, a couple of specific things that have occurred to me during our conversation. One is,
how many deaths do you foresee in Sweden? Is it 1400 or something?
I think it will be like a severe influenza. And it's interesting with influenza. When the
flu comes, we all say, oh, the flu is coming. Like every winter, it's in the papers, the flu is here,
okay. And it usually kills in this country around 1000, 2000 people. But it's normal,
it's influenza. We have it every year. And they're old and they're going to die soon anyway. So,
no one is very upset about influenza. But I think if influenza came around as a new disease,
you never had it before. But suddenly this new disease called influenza popped up.
We would have exactly the same reaction as we have now. So, I think the number of deaths will
be about the same as in a severe influenza in winter. Sweden, how many are you? 50 million?
Yeah, 65.
65. So, multiply by six. So, it would be 12,000 cases in the UK.
Yeah, well, we've already had 13,000.
Maybe 18. And a lot of influenza deaths are not booked or they're not recorded in that way,
anyway, in a normal influenza season. So, I think this is similar, about the same. And it may be
double as much, but it won't be 10 times as much. The reports from hospitals that are very different,
aren't they, that the way the disease progresses seems different from influenza.
Oh, yeah, it's different. It's not the same disease as influenza.
And the shape of the epidemic is not that different. There are a few differences. For
example, the influenza is driven by children. An influenza outbreak is driven by children's
society. They are the ones who pose it on between the generations. And this does not hurt children
very much. They don't have any symptoms and they're not very infectious. So, there are
epidemiological differences.
When talking about old people like you did as opposed to children, a lot of people will say
that young people have been dying of COVID-19. There are examples of young people dying and
some of the data out of America suggests that a large number of hospitalizations are among
younger people. Is it responsible to describe it as just a disease for elderly people?
No, but influenza kills people too, even though not that many. And it makes more headlines right
now. And if you look at the data, I mean the people under 50 are a clear minority of all the cases.
So, if I'm 38, I'm on the sort of borders between young and old. If you're younger than me,
what is your advice to young people? I mean, should they be campaigning to have the lockdown
eased because it's inappropriate? What are other risks for young people? I mean,
we're told that it's about carrying the disease to other people and they act as spreaders even
though they're not vulnerable themselves. What should we be doing with younger people?
No, I think it's because the thing you do know, they won't hurt that much. I mean,
you can't say that it's completely without what's the English word.
It's not completely safe. I mean, there will be young people who die, but for the majority,
but what you said is correct that they should think about protecting other people. That's
important because they move around a lot and they shouldn't meet their grandmother and grandfather
too much until they've had it themselves. Yeah. So, I'm just trying to get a sense,
we're nearing time now. I just want to get a sense. What should the British government do
now in your opinion? Did we should say, okay, lockdown is canceled? No, you can't do that.
Then you have a wave of O-cases. Then you really have a peak one week, two weeks later, if you
took away all the lockdown. No, you'll have to climb down one ladder at one
round of the ladder at the time and probably start with the school closures maybe.
It's a good thing it makes society. I mean, in this country, in Sweden, we have one million
children between zero and 10. They need to be looked after. If they're not in school,
then someone has to stay at home with them. And one of my friends who's a nurse and head
of an emergency room here, emergency ward here in Stockholm, she prays every morning when she
wakes up that the government will not close junior school because then she loses all the stuff.
So, school closure is one thing, but I think one step has to be taken at the time.
And it's interesting how the countries in Europe are sort of after the lockdown approaching the
Swedish policy now. They're opening up schools in all the Nordic countries. In Austria, you can
shop in a shop that's more than 400 square meters. In Germany, they're going to do the same thing on
Monday. In Germany, they're also thinking about opening the schools again. So, countries are
approaching the Swedish, but they had to lock down first. So, you don't think, because there's two
things that people get very hopeful about. One is a vaccine, and then some way we can suppress the
disease completely until the vaccine comes. Is that a feasible strategy? No, we'll take too long.
It won't work in a democracy. And one other idea are the so-called immunity passports, or
for people who have proven to have had the disease, they could then carry a wristband or
something, and they would then be allowed back into jobs and in full society. Is that a feasible
strategy in your view? There are some technical problems with, like you indicated, the antibody
tests are not that perfect yet. So, it would be, but it's not a bad idea. Do you need a passport?
Do you tell your boss at work that I'm immune? Well, maybe he wants to see a paper.
No, but, I mean, that's the way it will work, that you find people are immune and they can go
back and you can work in the hospital without all this space you've done, things like that.
Will that be part of the Swedish strategy? Yeah. So, in terms of what happens next then in Sweden,
there's a huge amount of pressure. A lot of people are looking to prove that it was a mistake in some
way. Do you think the Swedish strategy will just stay as it has been? I don't think it will be
tougher. No, we're talking now about opening the final year of schooling so that people who spend
12 years in school can celebrate, which is a big thing in this country. It's not because of the
celebration that it's being done, but it's to see that those who finish school get grades and finish
all the tests they have to take and things like that. And so, you feel like the curve is improving
sufficiently in Sweden to start releasing further the suppression measures? Yes.
And how did that happen without a lockdown? Just by voluntary social distancing has already
achieved that, you believe? There are some, maybe we should finish this now, but one
is not a law. What do you call a minor law in it? It's an ordinance. That's something that
not as strong as a law, but anyway. Restaurants, the rule is you can only eat sitting down.
The food should be hot and served at the table. You can't stand up drinking. If you want your beer,
you have to sit down at the table, which is five feet away from the nearest table.
And that's being checked now. But it's not the government. It's the local medical officers of
health that go out and check restaurants. And when they close two or three restaurants, because
the tables are too closed or people are standing at the bar, the other follows you. You don't need
a law for that. They know that if the MOH, the medical officer of health comes in, they're closed
for business. When do we get past that? When can we just be back to normal then? And no social
distancing at all. What will be the metric for making that decision? That's a good question.
I'm not quite sure I can answer that. But it will take a couple of months to climb down from a
lockdown. Can you climb down from a lockdown? I don't know. Open up. Professor Gisige, thank you
so much for your time. That was fascinating. Thank you. And we've learned an entirely different
perspective there. And we will definitely be in touch in one year from now. But hopefully,
we will get a chance to talk to you before that. Okay. Thank you. Nice talking to you. Thank you.
So there you have it. You have been watching Lockdown TV from Unheard. That was Professor
Johan Gisige from Sweden, the former state epidemiologist, advisor to the World Health
Organization, who believes that the lockdowns imposed across Europe and in the United Kingdom
were the wrong policy. And that we're going to find it very difficult to reverse out of.
So that is a different perspective. Thanks for tuning in. We will be back next week.
