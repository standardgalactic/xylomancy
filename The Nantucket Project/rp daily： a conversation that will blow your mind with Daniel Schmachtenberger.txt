Daniel, thank you so much for coming, Tom. As always, great to see you. Daniel,
you and I have been friends for a while. I've learned a lot from you. Thanks for spending
some time with us here. At a time when many of us in the world were learning how to ride a bike,
you were studying complex systems, you were studying engineering, self-awareness, cognitive
science, philosophy. You are an extraordinary autodidact. When I was introduced to you, the
person introduced us said you were one of the brightest people in the world. I kind of wondered
in the time I've spent with you, I've realized that's probably certainly true, if not an
understatement. You've done meaningful work on catastrophic risks, scenarios, and avoidance.
That's really where we began to get to know each other when I was working on warnings.
You continue to focus on a world spun out of control and the systems solutions needed to heal it.
You call it long-term civilization design, I think. You advise big, bold name technical leaders
and technologists and scientists. You're a hero of people in the world trying to make sense of an
increasingly nonsensical and increasingly dangerous globe. You're launching an initiative
called the Consilience Project, which I'm honored to be a small part of. I hope we can talk about
that a bit today. You spoke at the Flashpoints Forum conference last year. You and I jammed a lot
of your wisdom into a very short lunch session. That's the worst time of the day to speak. I still
thank you for doing that. I noticed in that talk at the Flashpoints Forum conversation, when you
were speaking at lunch, in the front row was a prime minister with whom I've worked for years.
He's a very serious man. Some people think of him as a very difficult man. He's clearly a technical
genius. I've never seen him so entrenched. I've never seen him so fascinated. I've never seen
him so amazed. I've never seen his face slightly puzzled. I saw all those things on his face when
you were speaking at our conference last year. That's often how I feel when we get the chance to
talk. I hope to bring some of that wisdom to our listeners today, many of whom will meet you for the
first time through this show. I also hope that we can get into a conversation about your complex
thoughts on how to fix our big minds in our world. Then I'd love to be able to get you and Tom to
spend some time comparing and contrasting his deep thinking, his big successes, trying to heal our
hearts. I think it's going to be a powerful conversation between the two of you as well.
I'm going to be up all night because I know this conversation is going to fire me up.
I also, having to be prepared at 6 p.m., had a cup of coffee or I'm drinking a cup of coffee right
now at 6 or else I would be tremendously outgunned. I'd only be slightly outgunned with a cup of coffee,
I hope. Here's to this. Daniel, thanks so much for being with us and it's an honor.
I think we have to be here over, ridiculously over generous introduction, but
there's a lot of things I'm very curious about that I've been trying to sense make and I'm looking
forward to the conversation today. Let me ask you about The Elephant in the Room. It's more than
The Elephant in the Room. It's the thing on everyone's mind. It's the front of every newspaper
and every news feed, which is the coming election for President of the United States.
You spent a lot of time thinking about existential and catastrophic risks.
Something, what is it, 35% of the voters right now believe this election, maybe a quarter,
is existential. They're extraordinarily concerned about the outcome here. There's a lot of other
people who are very concerned. I mean, you know, there's almost no one who isn't quite concerned
about where this election is going. Just broadly, I wondered if you had any introductory thoughts
about does this election matter that much? What does this election mean and what kind
of things are you looking for as election unfolds and the new president sits in relation to your
concerns about sort of long-term civilization survival? Yeah, I'll say I have more questions
about it than very solid predictions, but a few things in terms of how I'm looking at it.
What are you looking for? What's interesting to you? What do you think the outcome is?
What are the stakes? I think this election is unique in modern history of having two things,
both be the case, that a huge amount of the population on both sides anticipates the election
being stolen or rigged or somehow unfairly judged. They have questions around the election integrity
so that no matter who ends up being considered to win, it will be considered an illegitimate win
by a huge percent of the population. That combined with a huge percent of the population on both sides
thinking it's existential. The Trump camp, having many people that think that Trump is the only
thing that stands between some kind of globalist set of agendas and the debasing of national integrity
of the U.S. completely, and the anti-Trump camp that holds that Trump getting in will be the end
of the republic because he'll create a dynasty and formally the end of the republic. What do we
do in a situation where the chance of the election being contested because of mail-in ballots and
all kinds of things is very high? The Supreme Court, the Electoral College, the Senate, whoever
might come in to try and adjudicate that is also not really understood or trusted by citizens
widely. All of the journalistic incentive is for inflammation and we end up giving a situation where
the government is considered illegitimate with an illegitimate president in an
existential consequential way to coming up on half of the citizenry no matter which way it goes.
I think this is a huge issue and I think RPSU and Ergo were looking at being able to predict
social violence as it arose with the riots coming out of the protests from COVID.
We didn't know what would spark it. We knew there were like a handful of things, but we knew that
when unemployment goes up that much, the social violence possibility goes up pretty heavily. Well,
we still have very high unemployment. We have high evictions. We have increasing embodied
polarization around racial issues, around left-right issues, around mask, no mask,
COVID reality issues, and so now we're looking at this on top of all of that and the actual kind of
like insurgency and militia on both far right and far left preparation.
So I think we're moving, I think the election is going to be really problematic and I would say for
it very easily can be. I would say if there's a period of time where it is contested and the U.S.
doesn't have a clear executive branch, what the rest of the world does probably not towards the
U.S. directly but as far as power grabs internationally for geopolitical influences
is also a very, very big question, not just what happens socially, domestically.
One of the pieces of history I would say is for people that don't have a good thinking of history,
democracies don't live very long historically. They typically die in less than 300 years. We're at
about 250 years on this one. No civilization or empire is enduring forever. They all end up falling
and there are certain characteristics that when we look at the fall of previous empires and
previous democracies that we can kind of find that generally play out and we see those types
of things playing out pretty well here. So for me, and we already don't have something that's
really like a republic, we don't have a government of foreign by the people that are comprehensively
educated or have a unbiased or the state where they know what's going on and they're actively
engaged in the functions of the state. We have a permanent political class with a rotating door
between the market that it's supposed to regulate and the regulators that end up getting captured
by it and basically narrative and info warfare having replaced news and public education having
been eroded. And so the question for me is, and then you also see that like
when you have term limits and we understand why we have term limits,
it's very hard to do long-term planning for anyone who has an incentive to have things that
will pay off within the time of their term limit. When you have massive left-right polarization
for the two-party system, you end up having so much of the energy go into the coordination cost of
just getting elected and trying to keep everything you did going that the ability to coordinate well
as a nation is very low. So then you see over the last 20 years, China's ability with something
more like an emperorship to build high-speed rail all around the world and infrastructure
all around the world and we still can't fix roads. And between that and Turkey and Venezuela and
Brazil and movements in India, we can see a more autocratic direction globally as one of the trends
and we can also see why is because the idea of a democratic or participatory governance where
lots of people who see the world differently all work together is actually a ridiculous proposition.
Like it's a really hard thing to make that work well. And I would say that there is a level of
civilization fabric, social fabric that underlies that even being possible,
which is, you know, George Washington saying the number one aim of government should be the
comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government. And I think it was
Franklin who said if I could have perfect government and broken news or perfect news and
broken government, I take the perfect news because when people really know what's going on,
they can remake government. If they don't know what's going on, they can't possibly make good
decisions. And if we think of or a public or a democracy as a participatory choice making process
for consequential choices that are kind of shared across us, we have to have participatory sense
making and high quality communication to be able to coordinate and enough like political
understanding to know that politics is how you sublimate warfare. Like how you make compromises
with people that think really differently than you and value different things where
a compromise is better than warfare. So you actually can't just ignore and villainize them.
You actually have to listen to and work with them. So these are a few thoughts related to the
position the US is in. And so what I see is that we are at a place where the US has decayed to a
level where either it just has decreasing relevance in the world moving forward or it needs a reboot.
And the reboot of a real kind of republic has to be bottom up. It has to actually be citizenry
that are getting comprehensively educated about how to make sense of the world rather than just
get captured by some tribalistic narrative warfare kind of narrative that have to get much more
media literate and that have to start to have a value around good faith understanding,
not just the juridic strawman of the people that hold the other view, to be able to say how can
we work together because those other people don't stop existing just because I stopped listening.
So the Prime Minister's face is now getting puzzled. So I want to break this into a small
building blocks for everybody today. First, I'm reminded of a quote, well not a quote,
HR McMaster, and I know you familiar with him and you've seen our interview with him,
makes the point in our interview in his book that the deterrence effect of an educated populace is
extraordinary and necessary and we don't have that. I just wanted to touch on that quick thing.
But previously back on the election, a lot of people think it's existential. A lot of people
think it's rigged. It's very likely going to be contested probably over, you know, over 30% likely,
which is a humongous number that it's going to be dramatically contested. You put that on top of
massive distrust in our government to start with 65% of people believe the economy is rigged and
they're probably right based on where they're sitting. And you talk a lot about narrative warfare
replacing news. So let's start with that for a second. We had Tristan Harris on here who's saying
his praises about you and all the work you did with the social dilemma, which I wasn't surprised
after having watched the movie that, you know, you had a lot of your fingerprints on it.
Let's talk about narrative warfare. What's it mean that narrative warfare is replacing news?
I'd say there's cycles of this throughout history. You can read Sun Tzu and hear about narrative
and info warfare thousands of years ago, right? How to control what people believe is true and
what they think both as a political and military strategies as old as civilization.
As far as in the current environment, a few things that I would say are particularly key and
you probably covered this with Tristan. Well, the movement from broadcast news to largely
decentralized social media based uptake of the media environment is one of the most significant
factors in the contemporary environment because our governmental institutions were built in the
era of and around broadcast capability from the printing press with the broadcast or the
telegraph or the radio or the TV was basically one to many type broadcasts with very few people
having access to the mechanisms of broadcast and everyone else receiving relatively unified messages.
So of course they could be distorted, right? Of course you could have some moguls having more
political or economic influence affecting the news. So we're not saying it was at all perfect,
but at least as far as social coherence goes, everyone was seeing something relatively similar
when there was three news stations. When you have a and to the degree that it's wrong, there's at
least some accountability and there's not as much just complete overwhelm and the overwhelm drives a
kind of epistemic nihilism where people don't really even think they can really make sense of
it and then they're more just oriented to pick sides and defect towards strongman leaders.
Let's not skip over that. That's a fascinating idea I haven't heard you mention before
because there's so much news coming out of so fast people get overwhelmed and feel like they
can't keep up though in fact they're just looking at you know huge different many different facets
of similar news or fake news and that becomes overwhelming to them and they feel sort of left
behind. Yeah I mean flooding problem you'll see interviews or polls where Russians are asked if
they think Putin lies to them in the news publicly and it's you know extremely high 70 90% say yes
but then they also he has that high of an approval rating and in a situation where they felt
their country was kind of drained after the wall by the way capitalism came in
NATO's attacks on them whatever it was like having a strong man leader including having
to lie just existentially safer and I think in situations like current environment
people's ability to really make sense of climate change how long do we have how serious is it going
to be is like are we all just is my 401k even matter we all about to be completely screwed
and it seems like there are scientists who disagree on this and is China really
close to some kind of world domination plan or not it seems like there's very kind of
different views on that and hydroxychloroquine masks COVID whatever right like disagreement
on base reality across so many things and the ability to say well let me look at all the science
of it really try to make sense of it people don't have the time with a skill and so there is
then just a place where they start to resonate with both leaders and subgroups that are more
like them and so epistemology gets replaced by tribalism so it's similar to when under stress
we revert to type you're saying when under an overwhelming amount of information we still
revert to type overwhelming amount of information and dissonance of information and this is where
flood becomes a strategy right so fear uncertainty and doubt on purpose because then since people
can't make sense of it then rhetoric works better and then have the strong rhetoric and
and people don't want to be out grouped and they do want to be part of an in group whose
rhetoric appeals to the aesthetics of that in group you'll notice that the way that the demo left
leaning pop a left-leaning politician will kind of stir up the crowd doesn't appeal to people on
the right like as an aesthetic they're like I don't care if you call me a racist right now
and I'm not like saw climate change doesn't move me and whatever and similarly the way that someone
on the right talking that about national security or protecting our borders whatever doesn't appeal
to the people on the left so there's and it's it's a belief system but it's all the way down to
almost like a cultural aesthetic that the rhetoric can move people who share a cultural aesthetic
beyond the actual epistemology beyond them saying well what are the actual national security risks
what is my basis for knowing and how clear am I on that or what are the actual you know
border issues or climate change issues so yes I would say epistemology being replaced by tribalism
is one of the really huge issues and so then now we we're talking about the movement to decentralize
media so let me let me stop you and I'm going to do this a little bit so we can we can keep people
from losing you so flooding becomes a strategy I think that's a fantastic insight there's no
longer a shared reality there's no longer a modern name Walter Cronkite social media
and others are limbically hijacking us they know precisely how to do it our monkey brains
throughout the entire process are being driven back to tribalism is there a threshold beyond
which it's impossible to reel the public back into a shared reality is there a point where people are
so disillusioned and warped by misinformation disinformation that they can no longer be
reached by even our best efforts and if so are we getting to a point where too many people in
this country are are thereby lost if we keep the things that are conditioning people and
increasingly polarized directions in place yes we get to a place where interventions
would be very hard but like no matter how riled up somebody is on on the left or the right about
whatever like ready to take to the street with guns about it all they have to do is just scroll
Instagram for a while folk where political stuff isn't occurring but just social pictures are and
engage in entertainment a little bit and they'll mostly forget about it because there's such a
blood of other kinds of stimuli the reason why they don't forget about is because that media
stimuli is continuing to come through the Instagram and the Facebook feed and the whatever it is
pretty often if we could change the media environment because I think basically it's
there's a it's not just that it was encultured and now it's the case especially given how little
time most people spend in embodied space with each other and how much social interaction has
become virtualized through a screen and how much of it is then the artifact of this of the social
media platforms so do I think that if we were able to change the kind of media environment that
people were in that we could actually and change where people were taking into their minds that
we could change it relatively reasonably yes I do now how to do that's quite a hard problem
I don't remember the word you used RP but when you think about sort of this the social media
limbic thing is because they got good at figuring out how to draw your attention right
but there's another part of that where it's almost like the marketplace of algorithms that's just
going to do what it's going to do right and I know they can control it to a certain point but
basically they're they're going to distract they're going to they're going to make that limbic stuff
get all limbic-y right because that's what they're learning how to do right in what it with whatever
method they may use and so okay so that's just one side of the equation all I'm trying to say
there is like it's almost like a benign evil that's going on over there to a certain extent
and you know there's all kinds of you know incentive-based reasons why they may not want to
fix any of those things but then I even wonder to what extent they even could but let's put that
aside for one second on the other side of the equation and I think we're all going to marvel
at this one day some of us already do this guy Trump is outrageous like this guy's the biggest
media star in the history of the planet bar none I mean that guy's name has showed up in more places
in more parts of this world more times than any human ever right it's just outrageous what a big
kind of media star this is so what what he has is a certain kind of charisma whatever you want to
call it you use a different word I don't really care I don't want anyone to think it's a compliment
or not all I'm trying to say is like this guy puts on a show like nobody we've ever seen and if you
think of the last two presidents we've had we went from a big time rock star superstar which was
Barack Obama and that's when we were kind of moving out of the old days and we came into whatever
you call this guy the biggest circus performer in the history of the world I don't know and you
just imagine like imagine if Trump was like a little more Reagan asked now I know those two
things may not go together all I'm trying to say is if he if he looked sought a more broad appeal
of a certain kind like God imagine what he might do now you may not have the capability of doing
that kind of a thing anyway I'm getting verbose here but the thing I wonder is in the end might
our best hope be charisma tied to reason like I just don't know what other things what other person
what other group other than maybe that because let's let one other thing I want to say before I
stop if you think about what Joe Biden is I mean you're talking about an old white guy like really
old like will be the oldest president of all time who is anyone really voting for Joe Biden I mean
really when it comes right down to it I understand lots and lots and lots of people are voting against
Donald Trump I get it they're voting for a certain democratic platform but in the end like wow are we
at an interesting time and at a minimum like just put yourself in let's say Biden wins and now it's
August of 2021 what's going on is he really the charismatic leader that's changing this world is
that really what's going to happen or is it just going to be noise city just all kinds of new kinds
and noises that are coming from all these other weird places based on this new reality that maybe
Biden for the first time will teach us just how wild it is because this sort of calm older guy
sitting at the middle of it and it's still not orderly that's what I fear anyway I just said a lot
yeah so what I kind of hear you saying is that the charisma of a person speaking is its own
limbic hijack in addition wherever it is that the algorithms do and then you have an interplay
between those right between you have the limbic hijack of what goes out on the media and then
you have the limbic hijack of which of that is specially selected on my news feed based on my
interaction with it and obviously the news feed can't limbically hijack me if it doesn't have
content to put in there that has that effect right so the you end up getting this reinforcement
dynamic and you mentioned a benign evil so I'm going to just address the social media thing for
a minute and then come back to the the the president charisma thing yes the social media algorithms
whether we're talking about youtube's recommended video algorithm or facebook's news feed algorithm
when they drive political polarization or ideologic entrenchment it's not their intention
like there there is nobody there saying we want to make you know in tipa whatever
but in so far as they have to pick metrics to optimize and the thing is just as powerful
as it is and time on site is a good metric to optimize for and because of lots of reasons
the advertising model is going to be relevant to how much time on site and how many people are coming
but even beyond just the pay and the advertising model it's their way of sensing how much are
people liking this thing right uh people's life is not that good spending that much time on facebook
or youtube their life would be better to get off and to the degree that they're clear right that
they're in their kind of executive function prefrontal cortex they would check in quickly say
I want to spend 15 minutes and then go about doing other things but if once they've been
scrolling for two hours that happened because they weren't in their executive function right it
happened because either their fear of missing out or their desire for social cues because there's
lonely and there's lots of faces on there and largely photoshop faces or because of their political
outrage whatever it is but it's it's appealing to the things it would actually have someone spend
a lot of time that is not really well used time for them and so that drives addiction
because that's a limbic hijack right but it also drives things that scare me things that anger me
and um because if I see things that really scare me I'm not going to leave I'm going to feel like
I need to know this but then if there's a billion pieces of news on a topic and there's no way I
could ever take them all in what the youtube algorithm recommends for me or what the facebook
feed curates for me is the ones that based on my previous interactions the ones that I shared and
clicked on whatever are most likely to have me share and click on them so that means that it appeals
to bias and it appeals to emotionality so when you have a population where everyone's bias and
emotionality is getting doubled down on then you get increasing in-group tribalism and increasing
out-group antipathy right and it's very strong and people don't know it's happening because
let's say that I'm going down the youtube recommended videos or I'm going down the news feed I can
scroll down the news feed forever and keep getting more of the same type of stuff so it seems like
that's the whole world and of course because what's going to appeal to me there regarding talking about
the other side is going to be versions of the other side to get me fired up I'm going to keep
getting pejorative strawman versions of the other side and reinforcing versions of my side
which means that good faith endeavor to seek to understand is being broken right now because
that's what's being selected for on the facebook algorithm and that's where people are spending
time on site then the news agencies themselves have more incentive to make more salacious headlines
and shorter things that appeal to shorter attention spans and which means that they
can't possibly have complex or nuanced views because a complex nuanced view someone doesn't
have an attention span for yeah you can't run good sense making which also means you can't
run democracy with short attention spans you just can't right it it requires a larger bit size
to be able to understand something well enough to know what a good choice is and so the addiction of
new stimuli new stimuli I've been reading for five full seconds and I haven't got a new stimuli
that leads to the shortened attention span is itself fundamentally breaking down of the
possibility of participatory governance and so you get this feedback cycle right between what the
algorithms that are the digital environment which were consuming information about the world
and the producers of the content what their incentive is that will actually get paid attention to
and then the conditioning of the population and so we could intervene on any of those three
areas oh and then also the incentive of the politicians right so if a politician does more
salacious stuff that is automatically easier for the news to pick up that's also going to be useful
and so what we see is a set of reinforcement dynamics so then you're asking could we make
a politician who is charismatic enough but where the charisma is bound to good thinking
we could ask could we make news that tries to bind affected limbic hijacks to good thinking
you can ask could we change the social media algorithms in such a way that are still sticky
but walking people in the right direction and then at the end of it you could say
could we educate the populace to be more aware of how much the world is seeking to hijack their
attention and that there is feel good about any of those I feel good about a strategy that's working
on all of them simultaneously and I feel particularly good about the last one that I'm mentioning right
would it would it would it not be perhaps easier if it was a malignant thing
like might we be able to solve the problem more directly if it were more malignant that's the thing
that scares me is that the technium actually is take playing a role here that that's just
frightening to a certain extent I mean I want to believe don't don't get me wrong like I I
I have a predisposition towards optimism but I don't know like even the first one that like
we're talking because we're because we're talking about a certain kind of charisma
which I'll give you an example so today I watched Chris Hayes and and what's her name
Rachel Maddow just laughing so hard about the Jeffrey Tubin thing and like doing this kind of
bow thing together with each other on the news and I looked at it and I'm immature so I'm not
judging them as humans but I am judging our news like they were having more fun with Jeffrey
Tubin and masturbation than just about anything they could have had in a long time and I looked at
them like this is like the world we live in right now like there's no way Cronkite was doing that
and there's something to that that by the way from a business perspective apparently doesn't work
very well because if it did there'd be people doing it but from a cultural perspective it scares
the hell out of me when you say would it be easier if it was more malignant
the thing the deepest underlying things that are driving the problems in the world are not a
clear bad guy it's not Nazis people want to focus on a clear bad guy and so they actually
over norm things to that but why political left right polarization moved in the direction it has
or why a facebook why tiktok became more sticky than facebook did because of an incentive war
that even if you change one platform there's other platforms emerging the the underlying
dynamics are the are are kind of like an invisible hand themselves and they're a bunch of hyperobjects
hyperobjects is an important concept which is
we evolved to perceive things with our senses and to be able to look at hear touch taste and ground
to understand something to know how to respond to it because in our evolutionary environment we
were mostly responding to things like that were either direct threats or direct opportunities
that our senses could work with it's impossible to directly sense climate change
it's not something that you can sense i i can see snow melting somewhere but i could always see
snow melting i have to try to take statistics on snow melt year over year and ice caps and
things about co2 that i can't see that are invisible in the atmosphere so i can conceptualize it but
i can't sense it to have it feel viscerally real to me i can't sense the social media algorithms
i can't sense the the principles of narrative warfare or class dynamics or
any of those types of things i can't sense arms races i can see there's a drone but i can't see
all of the drones and the arms races towards ai weapon that conceptualize it but it's very hard
for us to conceptualize a hyperobject emotionally as well as it is a real object particularly an
agent because the bad guy historically mostly looked like an agent that wanted to come attack us
right and so oh it's nazis it's terrorists it's republicans it's democrats it's you know whoever
it is the bad guy is great we're pretty good at that when we have problems that are hyperobjects
that are the result of collective behavioral dispositions right climate change is not the
result of nazis or communists or or republicans or democrats right it's the result of collective
behavioral dispositions it's very hard to make that the bad guy in a clear enough way that will
motivate different tribes that are against each other unifying against them and so the kind of
enemy hypothesis where people will orient to be more tribal and they'll only unify if they have a
shared enemy it's very hard to make the hyperobjects that really are the shared enemy of everyone the
felt shared enemy because evolutionary we're not that wired that way so it's much easier to keep
making each other enemies but when you keep making each other enemies where you have increasing
narrative weapons right the ability to put fake or at least spawn or conspiratorial or whatever
it is info out and spread it to billions of people and make it highly viral and split test what makes
it most viral when you have when you have also then decentralized real weapons that are more
catastrophic cyber weapons drone weapons whatever what happens when you keep running conflict
energy from of humans towards other humans with increasingly decentralized increasingly
catastrophic capability it goes it goes bad right so we do have to figure out how to deal with that
thing let's get to that one second let me daniel let me try to i was thinking this morning about
can we channel the nationalist zeal that america has against china it is something that's
actually great for the growth of america like could we look at how china does long-range
planning and look at how they put their best and brightest into some of those long-range plans
obviously they have all sorts of other advantages we don't have so far as former government and use
that as a way to redesign aspects of america i asked that because i'm i'm i'm asked that in
reflection to what you guys are just describing about hyperobjects if can we use things like that
can we use things that stir us up as a people to motivate us to incentivize us towards positive
directions overall can we find things so punchline being how do we incentivize
people to pay attention to things that can't be sensed directly yeah so you have a couple
different answers the the only enduring and effective answer that i know is much deeper and
wider education so that's more people understand the hyperobjects well enough and can actually
make choices from executive function that they're not just needing an enemy hypothesis that they
viscerally appeal outside of that any solution i can give where i'm saying okay here's how i'm
manipulate the populist that don't understand stuff there will always be a that's a that that drives
armed races whenever i'm doing war you always get armed races you never get to create a weapon and
not have a counter weapon from some group that wants something else where they learn what was
effective about your weapon iterate on it so it's kind of like and i think this is something that
i've seen the political left recently in the us be particularly not cognizant of so if you use
shame as a social tool called people racist and islamic phobics and transphobics and whatever to
kind of like shame them into a particular kind of political view or political correctness that
shame as a weapon as a narrative weapon creates a counter weapon and the counter weapon is not
giving a shit about those titles at all that's one of the counter weapons right so at a certain
point it's like oh that just stops working call me a racist fuck off and another one of the counter
weapons is if okay let's let's have to the degree that academia and left establishment started to
have some alignment more than we can say was fully unbiasedly warranted and so there was a
people on the political right feeling like there were academic arguments that they couldn't argue
that didn't feel true to them or that didn't feel like it took their concerns to mind well so this
would be things like social sciences critical race theory whatever it is or some of the environmental
sciences that didn't that addressed and even whether they're wrong or whether they're just
partial but all didn't also partially address the things other people had lived experience of
anti-intellectualism becomes a counter weapon to weaponize academia where they're like I trust
my gut and I'm I'm sticking with the Bible or I trust my gut and I'm sticking with Trump or whatever
it is so it's always important to think about if we're not talking about really educating people
where they can think well about what's true and we're talking about well okay they're they're too
dumb to do that so how do we effectively use some kind of narrative control mechanisms on them other
groups will also be doing that to the degree that that's effective and then you have to deal with
the escalation the arms race of narrative warfare with exponentiating narrative warfare technology
now start to see what happens when they're putting on the VR headsets and being in these environments
and on and on some of so we've done a pretty good job probably describing some of the challenge set
in which we find ourselves in this civilization in this brain inside this media environment
and when I jumped in before that last question you were beginning to talk about some of the
modern day risks or consequences so I'm I'm trying to show a chapter separation here for our listeners
of you know what I think we were to learn about before is part of how hard it is to come to solutions
being who we are and where we are but I'd love to hear a little more from you about why it matters
that we deal with solutions well now and one quote that I heard you say I thought was was quite
illuminating was we're running through a forest increasingly fast and increasingly blind right
so what are these trees we may run into what are the risks what are the higher consequence
challenges that are in front of us right now that we may not be aware of I don't I don't
know that it's terribly useful for most people to study existential and catastrophic risk well if
they don't feel like they have some agency connected to being able to make things better because it
just can stress them out and sometimes even make them nihilistic where they don't engage the agency
they could have and I'm going to interrupt you and I did I tell you the story about and there is
just walked in about my 11 year old then nine year old when I was writing warnings and the
chapter on on the control function artificial intelligence and one of the parents of one of
his friends called me up and was like what are you teaching your kids at home because you've
terrified one of my children so I agree we evolution selected for all animals including us
for sensory mechanisms information processing to process that sense information and then
actuator output to act on it in a closed loop right if I could sense something but I couldn't
make sense of it there'd be no evolutionary adaptive value to that and it wouldn't have been
selected for if I could make sense of it but I couldn't act on it or if I could act in a way
that wasn't informed by sensing the environment none of those would be adaptive so what's selected
for is the closed loop between those technologies kind of broken that loop open for humans where
I can sense things that I'm not directly sensing through the internet news I can hear what's
happening in DC or Portland or Bangladesh or whatever but I can't actually make sense of
is that true is it the whole truth what's going on because I'm getting very partial sensing and on
things too complex so my I can sense stuff but not make sense of it to the degree I feel like I can
make sense of something large-scale things like climate change or whatever I don't feel like I
can act on because I don't have the agency like what do I do about that and to the degree that
I am acting on things I'm acting through largely decentralized distributed process I'm buying
something that had supply chains that took six continents and all kinds of activity to make
the thing happen so I'm having a fact right my action is actually through supply chains having
a globalized effect but I can't sense it so I can't really make appropriate choices and as a result
the the binding of sense making an agency is very broken and I want to rebind those because
if someone is hearing about problems that they feel like they can't do anything about oftentimes
there's just overwhelm and shutdown let's go to entertainment or whatever it is or sometimes
even worse is something like nihilism sets out and so I can talk about what are some of the
catastrophic risks but the context I'm trying to set first is I think for most people
them being more aware of their local news what's really going on and how they can help out
with the animal shelter the PTA the integrity of local governments the things where they feel like
they actually have some agency to do it they should invest more of their sense making in places
where they can do something about it because they'll actually then do positive things and they will
increase their sense of agency which will then allow them to start sensing larger things and
being able to take steps with it well I I sign up to that um but at the same time you and others
and I to maybe some extent have to make sure we are really looking at these existential risks as
well and I think that's probably a pretty wise direction for this conversation where you're going
we're we find ourselves with this challenge of incentivizing
accurate information disincentivizing false information I'm using your words
to make a request I would like you guys just quickly just name five
I mean I'm sitting here like I wonder what the fuck these guys think is existential
because I got my list so I'm guessing your list is better than mine and there and others
so just give us five something to think about I don't want to take too much right Daniel you
start with number one so some people categorize it by like uh exponential technologies whose
you're doing two you have to do one I don't have a taxonomy that I would wait that way
and so I was going to do a meta comment on maybe you want to share your top five and then I will
make some comments on that I don't know my top five I would say I mean we kind of covered it pretty
well but I would probably start with the control function on superintelligence um I would then
probably talk about and of course discuss to your concept about about self recursive technologies
I would then get to um uh CRISPR-Cas9 and gene editing and then I would probably get to
and obviously the use for that in biological weapons um I think there's
I mean I think there's a societal disruption probably coming from sudden global uh sudden
global sea level rise I don't think I put it as high up at my list and I feel like I'm kind of
missing something that we were talking about earlier which is about just the dissolution of
society it's not existential but so the dissolution of society the end of pox americana the end of
the ability for america to offer any sort of goodness to global world order the taking over
that mantle by a country that has shown great disregard for human rights which is china I don't
find that's obviously not existential but I think that's a category risk so I don't know there's my
quick shot so so what's not on your list is war not for existential so yeah that's cool but by the
way tom I think that's a good one too by the way it's a good one too I think that I think the the
risk of um global nuclear winner from even a much smaller nuclear exchange than the one that we
thought about in the cold war like a north kray us exchange or an india pakistan exchange as described
by dr allen robach is a very serious risk as well and that's a gigadeth risk not an existential
risk meaning millions and billions of people would die but perhaps not the end of civilization
cheery so yeah if we define existential as the uh end of all savians and there's even worse forms
of the end of all mammals or all hydrocarbon life on earth or something like that um there are not
that many scenarios that take us there uh and but if we talk about catastrophic risk of losing the
improvements of quality of life that have been happening and losing a huge amount of the collective
knowledge and wisdom and industrial capacity and like that as well as a tremendous amount of life
there's quite a lot more scenarios where that happens um and I know rp you've had uh nick
bostrom uh come speak in group before everybody should study boston's work if they want to have a
good insight into existential risk um reading uval harari's uh second book yep global catastrophic
risks uh is a good slightly easier intro to the topic um so i'll talk about catastrophic non existential
risk that i'm particularly more concerned by is something that involves cascades between a bunch
of different categories where none of them on their own if you're just modeling if i'm just
modeling nuclear risk or just modeling climate change or just poverty by itself i don't get this
but if i start to look at climate change not as something that makes a venusified uninhabitable
planet but something that makes increasing droughts that destroy crops and um going along
with decreasing groundwater start to create massive unlivable areas in india and bangladesh and various
places like that that lead to human migration and very large scale human migration that then leads to
resource pressures and resource wars that then lead to war escalation on existing political
fault lines that can then lead to increasing participation on multiple sides of that and
more scaled war that can lead to breakdowns of critical infrastructure and supply chains
and nationalist government structures
so you know i think that uh you know like with with covid and covid was just a big enough
catastrophe to start setting off a bunch of the systemic fragilities um i'll just i'll share one
way of thinking about this the idea of human induced real catastrophic risk wasn't even a
reasonable idea until world war two in the ball because we didn't have technology big enough to
mess everything up we just weren't that powerful and then and so the major empire's always warred
throughout all of history like we don't have any real knowledge of how to be at peace with each other
historically for very long periods of time only for relatively short periods and so now all of
a sudden with the nuclear bomb and the consequence of it the major empires aren't allowed to war with
each other anymore and so we got this breton woods global globalization world that said okay let's be
so economically interdependent on each other that it is and focus on massive gdp growth for the whole
world that everyone gets to be part of a positive sum game and we don't need to kill each other over
who gets the scarce resource because it's not zero sum people growing total gdp through globalization
extraction so fast and we're so dependent on each other bombing each other's a bad idea
and that gave us a relatively long period of at least the major empires not actually doing
kinetic war they did cold war and they did proxy war and there was an insurgency wars and i would
say that that world that breton wood set of agreements is largely broken down and is in
final stages of breaking down and what replaces it is a really big question here but since then we
went from you know call it two superpowers with nukes to a lot more countries with nukes but also
a lot more total types of catastrophe weapons as we're talking about cyber weapons can be
catastrophe weapons now by taking out infrastructure and drone weapons are easy and unlike nukes that
take nation state level capacity because uranium enrichment is hard drone weapons don't take nation
state level so non-state actors can have them which means you can't do mutually assured destruction
so mutually assured destruction only worked when you had two superpowers one catastrophe weapon
now you've got dozens of catastrophe weapons and many dozens of actors that happen
and you can't keep up the same gdp globalization growth because we're hitting limits of growth
in terms of fundamental resources and um you know biosphere issues okay so now what do we do here
so the globalization that that breton woods world caused also caused a lot of fragility
because what it meant was the world was so interconnected that if things broke down in
one area you could start getting cascading breakdowns because of supply chains and so the
world got to see oh wow we're very dependent on china for production of lots of things so what
happens if a breakdown occurs in china right so one of the things that i saw covet did and covet
is nowhere near as bad as the pandemics that could happen following in terms of virality or
lethality so it was kind of like just bad enough to show us how much we're not prepared for catastrophic
pandemics or anything um which hopefully we take the lesson of right now we have not yet
we have not started to increase effective global coordination towards this which is why sense
making this is critical but um okay so covet's an issue so we're going to shut down travel to
stop the movement of the virus well in doing that we also shut down critical supply chains
that included things like fertilizers and pesticides that were necessary for the way
that agriculture works in many areas of the world to increase food insecurity and increase
poverty type dynamics and this is what i mean by the way we solve problems causes additional or
worse problems we think too myopically if we're trying to solve this but not what will be unintended
consequence of this in a very very connected and increasingly fragile world be so the food
insecurity in nigeria of 26 million people who were food insecure who are now way more food insecure
which means vocal haram rises and things like that got way worse and in india we've got a few
hundred million people in relatively serious food insecurity on top of climate change already making
hotter drier summers and an erosion of groundwater so now in the next few summers where you can have
massive die-off of crop as a result of the heat so then you know when it's 52 celsius in the heat
waves and there's no food and water people don't die peacefully does that work over resource cleave
along muslim hindu lines if it does does it become an india pakistan war like this is where you start
getting to see the ability for just the normal stuff that is happening to start to really cascade
and it doesn't take a big thing to turn into a big thing it can take a little thing and the
set of cascades in a very fragile environment to turn into a very big thing yeah the um the um
two quick thoughts so one is um not to disagree with anything you said because i agree with
that entirely and this might seem flippant but i do have this thought that if cv-19 was a little
more lethal or killed younger people we would have taken it more seriously and it would have
ultimately killed less people um but your point about how it's kind of laid bare the fragility
of our infrastructure the just in time world we live in is absolutely real and to put a very harsh
point on that the world food program says it was actually a few months ago they said it i think
things are getting worse that 265 million people may starve in the next uh 24 months or less because
of the disruption caused by this you know relatively mild disease you know put differently
what's fascinating about this disease is that it's individually not that lethal but in a community
in a national level it's quite destructive um so i just wanted to have this for a minute
that's a quarter of a billion people right that was half of the entire population of the world
at the beginning of the industrial revolution like just to just have a sense of scale there
and then typically people don't just die peacefully if they see that other people have resources
and so then the question is can insurgencies that don't have comparable weapons cause
problems and i think we're all very clear now yes they definitely can and and and they can
without really good drones and crisper bioweapons but they especially can with those emerging as
technologies and so this is also where we get into a place of there are no really good security
solutions for anyone that aren't good security solutions for everyone in a world where you have
so much systemic interconnectedness and so much fragility and decentralized catastrophe
capability so anyone's investment in their own security requires more investment in
security writ large and boom that's when you get the idea of you have to redesign civilization
right if you don't then you have a whole series of of processes where you're making the castle walls
higher and then the trade buchet gets bigger and higher and bigger and higher and bigger and off you
go into a you know a contentious framework and a competitive framework that drives us into the
spiral which we find ourselves the by the way i value that those risk outlines those for me
because that actually got me to where you are right now in a way that's helpful so thank you
but what's what's important about that is back to this idea about hyper hyper objects is a part
of the way people different audiences reflect on different things and respond to different things
and daniel was making the point about democratic audiences moved by things different than jp audience
national security audience my audience is moved towards the concept of climate change when you
begin to talk about radicalization migration hyper nationalization and all these things that
happen and you can tell the story of the migration from levant into europe and how you this literally
happened the last two years you know so we see the very poor stories of the children drowning on the
on the banks of the med and then you see the governments of these countries taking in large
numbers of migrants and the structure and face of these countries changing becoming nor nationalist
in some instances because of that process and so we've actually gone through this loop already this
isn't a future looking crazy dystopian science fiction novel it's germany you know two years
ago it's sweden last summer it's like literally happened uh hunger you mean so as examples where
you have more of the hyper nationalist election um so it seems very theoretical and there's a lot of
crazy words flying around that a lot of people are going to have to watch this twice to get um
but we're living it i think that the destruction of the amazon is a very real us national security
threat and this is not in most people's awareness and so it ends up being this kind of leftist
environmental issue or whatever uh but when you understand the hydrological pump of the amazon
amazon is very big the water that is transpiring up through the trees that is then raining down
on the trees keeping it a rainforest it's keeping it so lush and growing so fast that's the hydrological
pump that water pump but it's pumping up excess water that then becomes north american rainfall
a very significant percentage of total north american rainfall and so just like climate change
has a point at which there's a positive feedback loop meaning with albedo effect in particular
right if the snow being white is reflecting sunlight less no cover reflects less sunlight
eats faster and you get this kind of runaway effect the similar thing with the amazon is that
it's postulated at a certain point you get enough loss of tree cover that you get decreased rainfall
on the rainforest creating increased susceptibility to fires and whatever and you you actually get
a break of the hydrological pump and groups like noa and nasa and other ones are modeling when
that happens and there are forecasts anywhere from like a year from now to 20 years from now but
like none are very long based on current rates of destruction of the amazon obviously you could
just mess up the headwaters of the amazon and ecuador and mess the whole thing up so it doesn't
it's not just again based on total acreage of farming or mining or whatever it's also based
on criticality but what would happen if that runaway break to the hydrological pump occurred
that dropped north american rainfall by 30 to 50 percent what that does to agriculture into our
aquifers it basically means that we have lost food security and domestic kinds of independent
capacity so i think that should be thought of as a national security threat and the state
department should pay attention to it so but here's a perfect example of again i like your
induction this idea to us of the hyper object here's an example of something that is actually
quite linear and gets the american farmer in the voter boom and a unfortunately to some extent it's
dependent on a belief in climate change and that whole science which a whole group of american
voters aren't going to buy although president a president biden certainly does and interesting
as you're saying this you might remember he mentioned the amazon rainforest in his debate
with trump which i thought was very odd um maybe this is why he did i didn't think it was a really
powerful thing for him to go for based on the voters he's trying to mobilize right now probably
wrong um but here's an example of something where like i get it i buy it you you motivated me um i
just kind of know with this system of government it ain't gonna happen like that message is not
going to get to the right people we're not going to take behaviors to do that and you and i and
some of our friends have talked about actually relatively creative and not that expensive ways
to get them to stop bringing another rainforest right um so we live in a system daniel where that
very clear negative causal loop uh is going to continue because we don't know how to absorb it
we live we have a complexity mismatch problem obviously without our decision makers we have
an acceleration of history with our technology you know etc and then we live in this media
environment where we don't share facts so so great work stating the problem set and it probably was
worth getting into the actual structural threat and my 11 year old left the room at that time so
i'm not going to get a call from some of his his friends parents although i'm sure i will for something
else um so let's begin to talk about if we can let's some solutions uh and it and i have a whole
series of questions i want to get to but let's just let's open it up what do we do about it yeah
any tiny part of the problem statement on climate change just because it's going to be directly
relevant to a solution yeah of course i would say our sense making around climate change
is actually very problematic uh not just sense making the climate but sense making the related
issues in the political climate and the the memetic climate of how people are going to relate to it
so let's say that all of the scientists agreed on the climate change model which they don't right
you actually have like call it the standard model which is IPCC but you have some very serious
scientists like Lovelock who think it's much more severe than the IPCC's model and Jim Hansen i mean
he lays it out brilliantly and you've got very serious scientists who are earnest who are not
paid by oil companies like Freeman Dyson who think that it's less severe because of how he calculates
non-linear dynamics and so there's there is like some authentic scientific inquiry around it but
let's say that there was just total consensus of the thing that we had to do there but the solution
is bound up with the acceptance of the problem statement and the way it's presented in the
public sphere so the solution is going to be carbon taxes um that have to get agreed upon
in some international order and then there's this idea that that's going to slow GDP growth and
so the US and whatever European countries agree to it if there are other countries like say China
or Iran that don't agree to it then they have marginal increase in GDP growth relative to us
that they can continue to reinvest in Silk Road military whatever it is that increases their
geopolitical position with regard to the rest of the world and so you'll see people rejecting
climate change without ever really trying to make sense of climate change because they think the
consequence of the solution affects something that they feel or care about more and this is where
you can't try to think about climate change without also thinking about the economy and
geopolitics right so just to be explicit on what you're talking about this is probably
a rational response from climate change denier actually that's not wrong that's wrong a rational
response from someone on the right to we have to instill these solutions on climate change is
very much on the lines of what you're saying it's just too expensive and I now I'm going to find
all sorts of excuses to deny the science because what you're suggesting is expensive and by the way
a lot of what you're describing goes counter to my view of how government ought to work
it's starting to sound pretty socialist I don't really like where you're going
and so this is where the adequate sense making has to be not just of a problem but the way the
problem space interconnects because otherwise we'll come up with a solution that solves that problem
externalizes harm somewhere else the people who are connected to where the harm is externalized
will vehemently oppose it and the coordination cost is too high to do anything so this is where
there is a level of good faith discourse and the level of really good problem understanding before
presenting solutions because if we present a solution prematurely it ends up being wrong
because maybe even if it's right in that narrow domain it's wrong in other domains and so this
also requires the ability to process more complexity first because being able to say well let's make
sense of climate change with before we present a solution well now it becomes easier if my
acceptance of science around climate change doesn't automatically mean that I'm also accepting a
solution that I think harms something I care about I can just get online with the sense making but
then I'm like I also want you to get online with what we're thinking about geopolitics with regard
to China and economic growth and the problems of slowing economic growth if we can make sense of
those things together then we can start to say is there a better solution set that addresses those
things together okay so now we're okay good so we're getting towards a scenario solution set
I gotta tell you at this point fully aware of some of these systems dynamics fully aware of the
challenge we have fully aware of who our decisions makers are and who they're likely to be I'm
pessimistic so why don't we um let's start talking about how to fix it
is the conciliants project a good place to start or yeah I mean the conciliants project is a project
that we're working on right now and you know you and I have talked about in this uh discussed ways
that airboat can uh be in relationship and we're honored we're honored to be a part of it I think
it's a big bold ambitious idea and I and I want you and I want Tom and Ida um you know we before
we started this call we read a bunch a little bit of the stuff and we have some you know we have a
bit of a view of what it is I want to hear more about it from you and then I want us to engage you
on on I want to see if you can turn my pessimism to optimism and I doubt you can so I mean first
I'll just say on that I I don't want people to have an optimism bias when they're doing sense
making I want their sense making to be as full and clear as possible because otherwise they'll
come up with wrong solutions I want their optimism to only be kind of in the space of what it is
that engender someone to work on solutions that aren't obvious in the presence of very
hard problems right it's not optimistic about a false solution set it's optimistic about the
innovation possibly that would have them work towards it so I think we're going to agree about
the significance and difficulty and entrenchment of the problem set and then what we want to look at
is what would a sufficient solution be and before we have a sufficient solution in the same way that
problems can cascade and we start to get solution cascades where something that is not sufficient
can give rise to more things that start to converge towards it sufficient I like the idea
the conciliance project is itself not sufficient at all but I do believe that it increases the
likelihood of many other positive things that start to converge towards sufficiency and I'll
just say like so the conciliance project has to do with how to really support a new kind of cultural
enlightenment at scale we'll get into that but there are other approaches that other friends
and colleagues have that I think are also very valuable like you know I have some colleagues
and their focus is hey two to five thousand families own all the world's wealth and they're
increasingly more powerful than nation states in a lot of ways they don't have land they have to
protect they don't have constitutions that they're bound to when nobody will use weapons of mass
destruction their access to private military contractors as functionally as big as nation
state military capacities are and algorithmic trading of money on money dynamics means we're
not going to escape that so why focus on the population who are too dumb and too controlled
just focus on getting those families to rule better in the new emergent feudalism that's
inescapable that's a compelling argument that the new emergent feudalism that's inescapable
that's a particular model I'm not saying did I agree with it but I think there's a lot of
thought and and validity to saying where there's a power law distribution of power
give a disproportional amount of attention to the top of the power stack if you can influence it
concerns projects the exact opposite of that right now it's actually a more kind of I want to
add one little thought to that for people who are paying attention to this the top one percent of
the united states controls 60 percent of the wealth or something like that but more critically
the bottom 20 percent of America has a negative amount of wealth because they're in debt the
bottom 50 only controls like six percent of the wealth like the distribution is extraordinary
and it's getting worse and worse and worse just to add some emphasis the point you made before
my first statistic was wrong I can look it up but conceptually I'm not sure people quite realize
what the wealth distribution looks like in this country and how different it was from the 80s and
and sorry go ahead and you know just to understand that if I have more capital and capital equals
optionality towards all other kinds of resources maximum liquidity and optionality I can control
private militaries I can control media I can influence politicians through campaign budgets
and lobbying and revolving door type dynamics and so to the degree that I need to influence
social dynamics I have the capacity and then even though you know when you talk about that
distribution one percent is kind of misleading we're mostly talking about point zero zero one
percent that have real top level financial capacity that I would say disproportionately
controls something like 90 plus percent of the way that the financial sector itself moves and I
got this that here it's the bottom 50 percent of the United States controls Tom what what percentage
of the U.S. wealth do you think the bottom 50 percent of America owns and by the way Daniel's
point is the control function is even higher but actually owns Tom what do you think the bottom
50 percent of America what percentage of the U.S. wealth do you think they own I'm gonna go with one
yeah it's 2.5 percent 2.5 and that basically is homes and 401ks this is not influencing
right it's got it's got no scalar opportunity exactly um and poor people are not good at
hiding their wealth wealthier people are better at hiding their wealth because it's quite useful
oftentimes to do so so the numbers okay but just footnote I'm sorry to drive you off I think part
of the problem we have today by the way is that rich people and and certain celebrities or others
not hiding their wealth and that they're they're invoking massive mimetic response
and if you go back to the 80s it was the lifestyles rich and famous that woke a lot of people up to
rich people right like there's all these great stories of folks who grew up you know poor didn't
quite realize they were poor until Thanksgiving when the next door neighbor's cousin showed up
from Chicago and he drove in a Cadillac that was wealthy now the wealth of the you know the wealth
of the wealthy is is thrown in our fate it's called keeping up with the Kardashians for a reason
right because you can't keep up with them and you're going to see their face day after day of
their wealth and their extravagance day after day sorry Daniel go ahead
yes okay so where were we supposed to go before we got into well we were getting
towards solutions and and you were and you were talking about there's a variety of different
solutions and you were talking about one about about you know sort of reinforcing a feudal state
okay so
and how the resilience project is exact opposite I believe that the long-term solutions
look pretty meaningfully different than the social solutions humans have tried so far
like I don't think the very long-term solutions are nation-state based um I don't think they look
like a single type of fungible currency and primarily private property ownership or whatever
rule of law enforced by monopoly of violence in the same way I'm talking about many generations from
now I'm not going to get into that because that's that's hard what I will say is
nation-states and global markets and and you know rule of law at the level of states is going to
be what continues to primarily be how civilization operates for the next couple generations at least
and so we have to make that system meaningfully better how do we vector in the right direction
and so I'm going to be assuming our existing types of institutions and looking at how to
correct some of the institutional decay that has occurred I think institutional decay is an
important concept because some people naively still run this idea of a continuous dialectic of
progress where things just get better and better and better as a result of say technology
and accumulated learning and I think it's very clear to see with the loss the burning of
Alexandria and the Dark Ages and the loss of the you know classical Greek enlightenment and
whatever that there's actually periods of emergence of things getting better and then
getting worse in meaningful ways and cyclicality and and major empires and civilizations do fall
well the important thing to understand is when the Roman Empire fell or when the Byzantine or
Maya or Aztec or Egyptian Empire fell they were not fully globalized civilizations they were
still local civilizations because of globalization if the kind of civilization staff meaning how it
does its modes of production falls now like every other one always has its scope of consequence
is unprecedented but failure is not unprecedented in fact there's no other precedent okay so coming
back to the idea of a liberal democracy for a moment I'm going to make this kind of US
centric and immediate is roughly you've got these kind of three sectors you've got this
market thing you've got this state thing and you've got this civil society thing that is not
market or state but is religions and community groups and other places where basically the
cultural values act so the rough idea and I'm not saying that this is adequate or true but the rough
kind of idea is okay the we're going to let the market do most of the modes of production
and most of the incentive and most of the innovation because it's good at it and we
don't want a central government that is too strong trying to do too much of that because
we founded this country getting away from excessive powers of government and we want
something that is more individual self-determining but we're not doing a pure laissez faire market
either we still make a state because we like the idea of rule of law because a market will have
a market for nasty things like slaves and organs and whatever and so things that we like to call
crime and be able to have a force to stop them and specifically it's recognized that
even if at t equals zero I gave everyone an exact equal amount of money in enough period of time
we would get a power law distribution no matter what because some people are better at making
money with it and then having more money gives them more ability to make more money and so
the the power ends up being auto poetic and falling on power law distribution so then how
do the few people up here who have the incentive and capacity to maintain their asymmetric power
not be excessively kind of inhumane to the rest of everybody else well everybody else
pulls their power into this thing called a government of foreign by the people a state
that has monopoly of violence it's going to have even more power than the most powerful
economic actors have and it can bind them with rule of law and rule of law is where our cultural
values because the basis of jurisprudence is ethics right the basis of ethics is some kind of
value system or metaphysics so we have some kind of value system that is the basis of jurisprudence
it's the basis of rule of law and we bequeath a monopoly of violence to enforce rule of law
to a state that had to be able to check largely the predatory aspects of markets and primary
kind of role of the state to enforce rule of law is largely to keep people from doing things
that they would otherwise have an incentive to do people or corporations and where we agree that
that's not a good thing to do so the idea is that the purpose of the state is largely checking
predatory aspects of markets while keeping functional aspects of markets but that's only
possible as long as the people are checking the state because otherwise the representatives in
the state will end up the market will seek to capture those representatives the watchdog
issue the classic libertarian critique and saying hey instead of regulating against my interest
regulate in my interest and you'll have better houses in the hamptons and Swiss bank accounts and
and a reelection budget and whatever else and given that lobbyists are paid for by somebody
and election budgets have to come from somewhere and whatever and then you start to get involved
in door dynamics so the founding fathers knew this so they said you know comprehensive education
of every citizen in the science of government adequate for the state of government of foreign
by the people people actively involved and it'll probably break down and it'll break down for these
reasons is the people won't stay actively involved because it's too expensive um and mode it's very
easy to complain about government while not actively investing hardly any of our life and
trying to be involved in governance yeah and then we're basically de facto consenting to be ruled
and then just complain so the idea is that if you want to prevent the kind of decay of a republic
into crony capitalism and eventually a kleptocracy and an autocracy the basis of it has to be a
comprehensively educated public who knows how to make sense of the types of things that occur
like market incentives like narrative and info warfare like problems with political science etc
and who are both comprehensively educated in knowing how to make sense of stuff
who know how to communicate dialectically with people who see stuff differently because they
know that's how you sublimate war and who have some access to current information right you're
good for the state so that they but where they still have the capacity to parse it and sense
making themselves if you don't have that as a basis you do not have the possibility for
participatory governance there is no republic there's just an illusion of it well it's actually
some kind of oligarchy or something so the goal of consent project is the acknowledgement that the
two of the pillars of or like not even pillars prerequisites for democracy or a republic or
subsidiarity or participatory governance of any kind are an adequate public education that is
teaching people how to make sense of the world well enough that they can participate in governance
and a fourth estate that's giving people information about the current world that actually gives them
it is an information complex right that gives them the access to the information that they need to be
without distortion to be able to meaningfully do sense making on it so they can do choice making
and that what I would say is that both public education and news and a bunch of other things
have gone through institutional decay where they are no longer serving that function and
the prerequisites or the antecedents of democracy don't exist and we have to basically reboot them
and I'm not trying to reboot them through a top-down process of how do we get government to fix
public education and get adequate civics and then whatever or legislate news but a bottom-up process
of how do we actually just start to educate people about the fact that right now the right is pretty
sure that the left news is fake news and lying the left thing's the right news is fake news and
lying what they don't get is that all the news is fake news and lying to various degrees but
that if we can show across the whole news landscape either fake facts or if not pickpacks at least
cherry pickpacks yes this fact is true but these 10 other facts are omitted that give you a very
different sense and then it was contextualized and spun like this so even if it's not full on
lying it's still misleading in the nature of ensuring contextual nonsense right and so there's
a kind of media literacy that people would need and you know why drain the swamp is so effective
is people feel corruption as a real thing and people don't want to be manipulated but to the
degree that someone saying they're manipulating you so trust me that's an effective manipulation
and so what we actually need is for people to start trusting their own capacity for better
sense making and have that trust be warranted because they're actually getting better at sense
making and not just individually but collectively meaning I'm also getting better at not just
trying to sense make based reality but try to understand what do other people think and why
do they think that so that because I know that if I just try to ignore or cancel a big part of
the population they don't stop existing and acting they do stuff and if I do effective stuff they'll
do effective counter stuff and strategy means factoring counter response so if I want to do that
effectively I'm going to be better if I can actually understand them and see if there is some way to
be able to work towards better shared solutions so the consensus project is looking at can we
actually reboot the republic here can we reboot participatory governance in some way and even
deeper than that globally we're not really succeeding with the sdgs very well we are not we
didn't do nuclear disarmament sustainable development goals yeah any of the large global issues we're
not doing uh preventing the ai arms race or whatever we we we're mostly not doing a good job at global
problem solving and that's a coordination issue either we don't understand how to solve it or
what some people think a solution is other people actively are opposing or you get multi-polar
traps where there's things like arms race race to the bottom type scenarios to solve the coordination
choose requires some kind of shared choice making and the basis of that a shared sense making
communication and that and the basis that is not in state or market but in culture right a value
system around better sense making and better good faith dialogue right now those are not even highly
valued things they're not trained but they're not even very highly valued okay so within so
just to redefine here to help people kind of follow along so you've got government markets and culture
inside the concept of culture uh to prevent the decay of the system of government in which we live
into a comptocracy we need to have people who are capable of overseeing and participating in
government and right now we effectively don't that's only going to become more of a problem as
the world accelerates around us and more technology matters more complexity matters and we have a
complexity mismatch problem but actual participation and governance is critical and only can happen
with people who are aware or educated enough and to be able to have that role and you get back to
the thomas jefferson fdr hr mcmaster quotes about an educated populace being not only critical for
democracy but also a great deterrent to war um and when i so when i think about actual launching
points um one thing we've talked about is and before corona one thing that gave me a sense of
optimism was there was an increasing amount of training or education for children in self-awareness
meditation you kind of get into like anti-bias training understanding the flaws of the wet
computer between our ears right so when people begin to understand that you know everything
that is us is us drives us and and we are is a hundred twenty thousand year old wet computer
that's driven by biases and heuristics and pushes this bag of meat around you can begin to get people
to you know sort of get that user manual for how we work who we are and then they can enter you know
an education environment is there an amount of self-awareness and bias training and you were
saying sort of media awareness that's a necessary prerequisite of education for an educated populace
there by relevant to to help lead this country in an upward trajectory yeah so if we're if we're
going to discuss kind of like the anatomy of the problem space of what broke sense making
and kind of civic fabric down which then gives the categories of work that need to happen
there's absolutely a bunch in the way of um decay in public education yeah and we can kind of look
at why there's a bunch of reasons but let me let me just sort of lean you over towards
and what what what does conciliance project what are other ideas what are some solutions to
I know you're you're being very responsible about illustrating the problem set but looking at the
clock and hoping to keep it at two hours what are some solutions um so the conciliance project
I mean basically we're trying to support what we see as an emergent but not yet recognized
cultural movement towards better sense making and better dialogue as the fabric of society
in which problem-solving of any kinds of problems that we care about can happen and let's just talk
about that for a second so this is a movement that you know if you think about what is that um
I like Pina Coladas that that's that silly song about the guy who meets the girl in the dunes
help me out here and there's there's a joke in there about you know if you don't like yoga right
so like in the 70s it was cool to not like yoga to make fun of people meditate and we're we are
certainly moving more towards you know a person who meditates or thinks about self-awareness is
no longer a standout freak but maybe there is a cultural movement towards oh maybe self-awareness
is a worthwhile thing maybe expanding our circles of empathy is a good thing is that is that part
of what you're talking about do you believe that's right do you believe there's more of a possibility
in this country to talk talk about these soft things that are historically non-masculine and
non-tessosterone driven and thereby lots of people ran away from them I mean I really appreciated your
conversation with General McMaster where he was talking about empathy because it didn't seem soft
and feminine it actually seemed directly relevant both to preventing more and being successful at
war and I think it was it's a it's an important frame that empathy is not the thing that people who
are unaware of conflict theory do and that makes you kind of bad at conflict theory or or winning
Sun Xu saying do you understand the opponent and if you're going into battle you don't understand
the opponent that's empathy right there's a there's a way that to even be effective at war I have to
understand my opponent but also to be able to prevent war to be able to sublimate it through
some kind of political compromise I have to actually really get what the other people think and feel
and what need to say what are the right solutions here so I think empathy I mean and this is
this is actually partly why sociopaths oftentimes have higher cognitive empathy than the average
person but lower embodied empathy is that they're good at modeling someone else's theory of minds
a game theoretically beat them but without actually caring um and so you can weaponize empathy and
that's something we have to be very careful about um that's you know cult leaders are good at that
cluster beat disorders are good at kind of a weaponized empathy uh but uh okay do you want me to
stay on the empathy mindfulness or come back to the what do I see as the critical parts of
solutions I think with that it's not purely cognitive right the development that we need in
people is not purely cognitive training to be able to understand existential risks and climate
change and and even social science and politics it's also if they move into outrage too quickly
if they move into overwhelm too quickly they're going to be useless
or problematic or make things worse so there's also an emotional intelligence and you know you go
back to looking at like the Greeks exploring this the stoic school and the Aristotelian school
and the Socratic school kind of were all parts of something that was more complete together
that weren't complete on their own right the Aristotelian school is can we actually understand
the formal logic and the kind of scientific thinking and natural philosophy to make sense
of base reality together the Socratic schools can we understand each other can we take all
of the various perspectives in the debate the stoic schools can we understand ourselves enough
that we don't get hijacked by our own emotions if we can understand base reality we can understand
each other and we can understand ourselves we can start to get somewhere and so in terms of what
is the necessary cultural enlightenment of this time it definitely requires at least all three
of those facets fair enough and talk a little bit more about how you're going to achieve some or
all of that with or I know you said it's not an entirely it's not an entire solution set but talk
about how Consilience Project is going to be valuable in that end to that end yeah so if you
don't mind two major kind of parts of it there's a kind of movement coalescing part and a kind of
education and content part the education and content part is us working on developing something
like better news and which is the assessment of base reality so what are the most consequential
things happening in the world and what do we know what is an overview of the topic that is we can't
say unbiased but we can say bias corrected I'll explain that in a minute what do we have high
certainty on about this topic what do we have low certainty on why do we think it's consequential
and what are the questions we're asking and the indicators we're watching to see how this thing
unfolds and even framing it that way helps educate people how to be better sense makers for them to
even notice in themselves where do I have high confidence where do I have low confidence and
what is my basis of confidence that I just come to high confidence emotionally or because a leader
that I like said it I didn't look at the data myself right so even just starting to calibrate
those things and then to emphasize questions more than propositions and think about why something is
consequential that factors second and third order effects this is all giving people information but
also training them how to process information by the way that we're processing it built into the
presentation but then if someone's like well why did you come to that certainty why would I trust
you we like don't trust us actually trust your own ability to make sense of things if you so here's
this weekly intelligence report of critical things going on but and we're trying to present it as
simply as possible but if you want to click under the hood you can see how we derived it what things
did we read what data sets did we look at how did we make sense of it how what epistemic models
did we apply and how did we calibrate confidence now it's kind of a better than but parallel to
a peer reviewed scientific study on what's actually going on there's some parallel to that there is
some parallel to that and so now somebody can look at it and one if they think we missed the
data set or mis-weighted something they can let us know and we will be continuously updating our
models and correcting our positions transparently right which is really important including doing
retrospectives of where we got things wrong or missed stuff which is another important thing
there's a kind of epistemic humility for people to not be focused on being right but focused on
earnest inquiry which involves being very clear where you're wrong and but also they get to see
like wow if this if I didn't have this order to make sense of it for me if I went and looked at
all of these different types of news sources from different countries and different political
perspectives and I applied these models and I parsed it this way I could make better sense of
stuff too so right it's teaching people sense making and then also hopefully well okay that's
one part so basically that's the news the meta news is where we're not making sense of base reality
but we're making sense of the media landscape and helping people have a better kind of
media literacy and understanding of the narrative and info warfare so that they kind of get
inoculated against it was it I think one of the newspapers in Washington Post or something and as
soon as I mentioned any newspaper everyone's going to have their built-in biases about the biases
of the paper but one of them used to publish documents like the government released this
statement and then would have sort of journalists commenting on the document the way down it was
a pretty neat tool to help us under oh when they say this they're trying to you know fool you with
ink you know blah blah blah you know yeah so that kind of commentary right so what we're
seeking to do here is that this project is a nonprofit it commits to have no profit stream
it won't put anything behind the paywall won't sell anybody's data won't have ads and so
there's no vested interest in that way the articles that are written are all written
by the house like the economists no journalists names are on them to both make it safer for them
to say what's true even if it's controversial and for people to have to deal with the content as
the content rather than have a kind of ad hominem or identity politics approach to it
and the organization will shut down after five years the nonprofit has a five year time to live
so that it's not a progressive jobs program or career opportunity for anybody and it's not
positioned to have a part of the power landscape it's trying to catalyze something trying to
catalyze something culturally that will happen outside of it so any group that's trying to do
good sense make and couldn't see us as being in competition we only succeed long term we get a
lot of other groups to succeed and so I'll mention that in a moment the movement building part
yeah that's a big question I have the meta news part is where we take some topic that is trending
and highly polarized like masks or hydroxychloroquine or um lab origins of covid or whatever it is
and um or police violence as a function of institutional racism in the US and we start
by saying what is the landscape of primary narrative sometimes there's just two narratives
there's kind of a left and a right narrative whatever sometimes there's like five narratives
there's also like a strong libertarian critique of both there's a conspiracy narrative whatever
and of course there's a thousand sub variants but they kind of cluster to some primary narrative
structures or tropes so we do this thing in the meta news saying here's the narrative landscape of
the things that are trending that a lot of people believe and then we steal man each narrative which
is the opposite of straw man which means we try to make the strongest case for it possible because
most people who aren't in a narrative either don't know that the narrative exists or can only
think that the people who believe it are just kind of dumb and bad they don't have a compelling
understanding of why anyone could believe that thing because the version that that their social
media algorithm is curating is the one that will appeal to outrage for them or whatever so we want
to actually be able to help people understand actually what is come what the narratives are
and what's compelling about them this part of the Socratic process of do we understand each other
then we want to convert those narratives to a bunch of propositions and say what evidence is
given to support these and then on that what evidence can we find to either formally falsify
or verify and if we can't falsify or verify can we at least find things that make it more or less
likely and how do we calibrate that so we're teaching people first to assess a narrative
landscape then to empathize with other people in the form of can I try to really steal man their
arguments which is also good faith dialogue right then analytic propositional logic can I actually
go through and because what a lot of times happens like this is true this is true therefore these
eight propositions you already got me on these two these have no data but the people just kind of
believe it right and that that type of thing we want to go through and be able to say because
then what we'll also be able to show is in everyone's narrative there's some true stuff there is some
signal which is actually also very important to realize then we can also see that across most
of them there's some falsifiable like clearly nonsense but also a lot of just cherry pot and
spun stuff and then a lot of stuff that's pure conjecture that we can either falsify nor verify
that is basically just spin or whatever we should have low confidence then we step back and say what
can we say with high confidence about this topic after having looked at all this so we're not saying
unbiased we're saying we are taking each bias on purpose so we can bias correct right so now one
of the things that will happen is we'll also be able to show exemplars of each of the narrative
like the top news sources and show okay here's where they put spin on this thing here's where the
nature of the title is misleading but it's what you walk away with from what the actual science
said or whatever and here's where they cherry picked so people start looking for cherry picking
they start looking for spin all over the place so they're getting inoculated against the tools of
mimetic and narrative warfare and as a result tribalism and strong leader dynamics and whatever
and starting to actually think so there so news meta-news then there's some other deeper education
stuff long-form pieces about things going on in the world if you really want to understand well
what's going on in the china india border or 5g or whatever it is deeper things in there but again
what we're doing is trying to teach people how to make sense of the world in the process of making
sense of something they care about now that is largely to start being a strange attractor of
people who are seeking better information and showing people what the fourth estate could be to
increase demand for higher quality things to try to create a race to the top in the media environment
rather than the race to the bottom of more salacious shorter etc that has been there
so then in the movement coalescing side we're working on putting together innovation challenge
okay so then just to locate people so what you just described is an extraordinarily gorgeous
orchestra of information that I would love to see I'm excited to be part of you know as as you've
just painted it that would be an unbelievably immense and beautiful gorgeous thing to read to
look at to to see to learn from now you would you say movement building and and I know we're
going to run out of time quickly you're can you describe I guess faster than then yeah how do you
get it sounds like an elite focus thing how do you get the rest of the country to pay attention
to this we started building this and started reaching out to advisors and people working in
the space we started finding hundreds of really brilliant projects to increase sense making a
public dialogue that just either didn't recognize themselves as part of the movement or needed help
getting a certain kind of traction so there were some groups who had built a tech that could
be made as a web browser plugin and fact check any site that you're on news sites highlight things
that look like facts and then identify data sources where you could go check those facts
and that should be a web browser plugin everybody has and it should be continuously
getting assessed and being made better there was another group based on layoffs work that
made a kind of semantic processor that could identify across news sources narrative framing
and show the frames that were being used show news organizations using the same frames and
where you could look at the same topic across different framings of it that should be a web
browser plugin that fucking everybody has so they can understand the principles of statistical
cherry picking data manipulation and narrative manipulation but then they can web browser
plug it and see it in real time and the stuff that they're scrolling on Facebook when it pops
up they can see those things and so then that starts to create an incentive to find the ones
that are less manipulated which starts to create a race to the top of an orientation of the media
to offer different supply because the demand is changing through education but those types of
projects were like man we really want to help those projects succeed because some of them
just were like a few computer scientists working on their own they got to it but then they don't
have the resources to take it further or an academic institute a media lab got it somewhere but then
it's not part of their mandates to take it further so we're like we want to host innovation
prizes we also saw people who are doing really good jobs of like making cartoons to teach American
history and civics to high school kids but it hasn't scaled it was like being done in one town
but that same thing should scale all over the place what's that like the oatmeal
I don't know the oatmeal but oh you don't my god okay there we go you check it out when we're done
you're gonna love it there are people who are working on how to make peer review better or
remove bias in journalism or bias in academic science or get better at identifying state sponsored
narrative warfare in the US from other states and what we're saying is those are all parts of one
issue that people haven't recognized as one issue which is the breakdown of sense making
writ large and I think by even bringing them into one environment they start to get more
self-awareness that these are all parts of one thing and there is a cultural movement towards
valuing sense making and high quality dialogue is the basis of our capacity to solve problems
and then our ability to curate the resources that are actually good and direct people to the
resources that are good the ability to create forums for the right kinds of interaction where
the architectures and sense good sense making and good faith dialogue and prizes that help
both new projects emerge and that change the nature of demand for existing projects and where
the products we're making are really like prototyping and then open sourcing what it could be and
encouraging anyone to rip it off like you want to take this to your country and implement it or
locality or whatever awesome so the goal is movement catalyzing in a finite period of time
and education and kind of the attractor basin I love that I thought you were going to describe
how to build a movement to give people to look at the conciliants project you're talking about
using the conciliants project to create a movement on a couple of levels a movement towards driving
people to higher quality journalism and movement towards sort of an incubator of great tools
how that happened etc that's that's fascinating we're running out of time quickly so go ahead
the underlying gist is that there's a commons just like there's a commons of air or water that
can easily fall prey to tragedy of the commons dynamics there's an information in epistemic
commons of the data the data we need and the processing on that data we need to make sense
of the world to decide what good solutions for anything are and that information in epistemic
commons is not stewarded right it's crucially right and it's there's maximum incentive to
manipulate that comment I think that's a really important concept you'll understand the information
comments do tom I um I imagine you have a lot of thoughts but I I don't want to put you in the spot
but well I'll give you my um I mean I love sort of walking down the road the way we walk down the
road um you know I have to admit selfishly I got a very powerful description of why I do what I do
every day I mean literally I wouldn't have defined the problem the way you define the problem but
I'm talking about the same problem I wouldn't have defined the solution the way you define the solution
but that's what I do every day I mean literally I mean I guess an important difference for us is
like we're very focused on story and it's really about meaning shared you know we do these gatherings
all over the place and you know relatively unscientifically I can tell you that 90% of the
people when they have that opportunity to share meaning they love each other I'm and I use that
word specifically I believe in that word sounds corny and loose but it's real and and ultimately
you're talking about a very similar kind of thing if I have a fear if I were going to
define my fear and I say fear because I want you to win um you know one is the bummer and I
say it's a bummer because I think I used to not believe this was the case is that even with creative
projects the winner works the hardest like the winner just busts his or her ass and read does it
5,000 times until it's good and and and that element of this idea I think is huge which is to say
there's going to be a Steven Spielberg of even what you do even if it's the way the gizmo looks
even if it's the way the interface works with the way the stare the story sort of winds its way in
or when you start to think about a movement it's critically an emotional thing you know and that
storytelling thing being so critical if I'm if there's something I would be afraid of one of them
is I love the idea of the five-year thing I just don't know if that holds what I would hope it would
hold and then the second part is I'm not sure not for profit attracts the kind of killers you need
and I that may be a pessimistic cynical view but I think there are people who more and more
can hold both things I mean think about like a rock like great musicians think of the grateful dead
ironically they were capitalists now they weren't capitalists first but they didn't do it not for
profit there's a freedom to there there's a risk there that I think creates something that's just
different this is my own philosophy I'm not I know I'm not a hundred percent right on this
but I think there's this interesting prop for profit not for profit thing that's hitting a new
place and that part makes me anxious but anyway but okay so those were my I spent time talking
about my fears and criticisms but like I'm talking about like the little part at the end
as opposed to everything I heard before and I love it and I and listen I think it's
I think to be passionate again in this country about education because unfortunately it's been
about money you know we keep talking about money and we keep saying it's about debt and we keep
saying it's about higher ed my view is it's different ed higher I don't I don't even like
how are you gonna draw that line um and what's it really about like what what is is is learning
about a job is that really what it's about and I know that's an important piece of the puzzle I
don't want to diminish that but what you're talking about is nobler I mean it just is and so how do we
celebrate that as a culture again because we don't celebrate it that much like the notion of what a
liberal arts education is or what it should be I say should what I what I think it could be
man I'm not sure we even jump up and down about that anymore I don't know I don't hear it very often
I really like to use the word noble because it's um
there was a thing before democracy you know called the nobility as one governance system of some
people who uh for whatever reason were were developed or believed to intrinsically have
but that largely developed the capacity for good judgment and uh you know decision making
that that involved nobility not just you know cognitive capacities and nobility moving from
being a class of people to being a distributed characteristic right is one of the core essences
of the democratic republican ideal and the idea of democracy as we all have a say that's
participatory governments we all have a say in what happens so there was this idea that the internet
would democratize access to information everybody could have access to information but when there's
a billion search results on anything access to information is utterly useless information
processing is the key and there is not a democratization of information processing you have groups
that have access to massive big data analysis and private and public intelligence and most
everyone else who only has access to narrative warfare aimed at them and so if you want to have
anything like a democracy you actually have to have democratization of information processing
what we're trying to do is to be able to provide information that is the quality and nature of
information the top level institutional decision makers currently get to everyone because the
idea of a decision maker is an anti-democratic idea this is why it's a nonprofit is we will not put
it behind a paywall it's because it it will be fully available with no manipulation won't require
an email or anything for everybody now if people want to make a for-profit news institutions as
part of the movement awesome we want people to make for-profit private intelligence companies and
news organizations and whatever as well as nonprofit ones but the stewarding group that is
stewarding the information commons must have no other master here in this particular way of doing
it which is just our goal is to both steward the information commons and to get that to become a
recognized thing where it becomes decentralized stewarded by lots of different groups and kind
of as a cultural value and then to not have any other reason to exist okay i mean i that's fair
but there's some master to that money as well when people donate they can try and have strings
attached and this is where great founder hypothesis is important um apple post jobs isn't the same
and musk industries post musk it's probably not going to be the same and so institutional decay
oftentimes starts to occur when the founder that was the for the founding group that was
motivated by the thing that's gone and they didn't pass on that process that generator function of
the wisdom well enough so you get generational decay this project is not going to last long enough
for that to matter here the generational decay issue is a real issue but um as a founding team
focused here we've had times where people wanted to give money with strings attached we just told
them to fuck themselves and because we know what we're actually committed for yeah and the same is
true with people who would work in the organization if they can you know have this is why like also
no names associated is there isn't there is there's actually the nobility part i like there's actually
a noble imperative that is deeper than the capital imperative and it can be tapped into earnestly now
it's been manipulated so much you have a group of cynical a whole kind of cynical population
where all there was no experience of real virtue only virtue signaling but real virtue is actually
a thing and the ennoblement here is the idea that everyone could be possibly a meaningful
decision maker and contributor to society and they all we want them all to have access to the best
information anyone has access to there's an ennoblement of what we think about the value of the
mind and this is a key thing not only do i not want to manipulate what someone does who they vote for
what they believe on something i want to give them better ability to make sense of it i want to
inoculate them against anyone being able to manipulate them effectively moving forward right
we want to help them increase their sovereignty and increase their communication with other people
so that collective intelligence individual collective intelligence is actually a thing
that's the actual thing that we believe in as a basis for change across lots of different
vectors well i mean i love the spirit of it and and i you know i and i mean this sincerely i mean
this very sincerely i don't fully understand that but i want to and i i respect what you're
saying i really do i'm not i'm not trying to be cute at all and part of it is because of my own
experience in the four versus not-for-profit realm and then just sort of the battle of ideas
because it just you know in essence it just becomes you know i've seen the most some of
the most competitive people i've ever seen in my life are people running not-for-profits who make
you know decisions based on personal foibles and things in ways that are just so destructive
you know and then there's also this just this kind of um there can be this sort of elitist view
that permeates the place based on other things and we don't need to talk about that right now but
i'm saying this because i care and i and i think these are reasonable and good considerations
and we've went over hundreds of them you know internally like possible strategic considerations
the very good advisory group and we'll continue to and we'll pivot strategically to what serves
best as we really learn what serves best the clarity of what the actual mission and vision is
is clear is how do we actually support an increasing integrity in the information and
epistemic commons and how do we increase a shared cultural value towards not just group
virtue signaling and outrage and whatever but
high quality sense making and high good faiths dialogue as the prerequisites of our ability
to do any of the problem solving that we really care about and uh you know these the kind of
conversations about these things uh we'll be happy to have them on or offline at some point
yeah i think there's also probably some very powerful synergies here between
tom your extraordinary ability to tell stories and to
grab people's attention without limbically hijacking them and and and what you're trying
to build here daniel um i uh i certainly got a whole lot more than i expected out of this
conversation it's going to be fascinating to see how we edit this if at all but um and there's
there's a question tons of questions that even get to us maybe we can do it again deal i want i
want to talk about well there's a lot i want to talk about either on camera off and and i
let me say too that i would love to tell this story this story it was a great that was a great
treatment right there really it was a great treatment for film and you could tell this story in about
i'm making this up 19 minutes literally in a really useful form and i think it would just
i would love to hear your thoughts and get your help on telling the story
it's a great great story and i love i love you know the i mean in the in the world of information
overload prioritization just becomes so much more critical and if we can find that place which in the
end will include nobility will include it's going to it's going it it it well it's dead on a rival
if it doesn't have the energy to carry through and if you leave those pieces out of this puzzle
i'm sorry man it's just it's the way the world works these days it's like constantly tearing
things apart and if it doesn't have that integrity that holds it together you know other than you
know to be a new addiction because if you're making a new addiction you could probably ride that train
for quite a while but if you're trying to do something different it requires it has to carry
some elements that are really powerful i want to say one thing about addiction it's the last thing
i'll say so in the present you know we evolutionarily evolved to have high dopamine response to salt
sugar and fat because in our evolutionary environment there were many of those things
we developed the ability to make lots of those things combine them very effectively fast food
obesity we know that thing it's actually very hard if kids are being exposed to that to not
go down that path you know especially when they're young they don't have good discipline
develop whatever it is not true that in the presence of those a hundred percent of everyone is
obese there is a way to develop discipline and good habits even in the presence of those things
and to get positive feedback on health and vitality rather than the positive feedback in an addiction
direction and we see people who it's not addiction but have a strong positive feedback loop around
fitness and health and things like that it's not enough of the population but there is a thing there
where discipline is actually trained and required to move in a direction other than the near term
hit hypernormal stimuli direction the same is true cognitively emotionally socially and
we can train people to have discipline around not just taking the hypernormal stimuli hits and
being able to do better sense making and the importance of that and the people who do will
do better they will understand the world better navigate it better and the groups of them that
converse better will have more collective intelligence will problem solve better and
become a straining tractor and one of the things I'll mention is that hypernormal stimuli whether
it's dating apps or porn or social media or fast food what they were to the actual evolutionary
thing hypernormal stimuli is something we're way more susceptible to because we live in a
hyponormal environment meaning the kinds of stimuli that we evolved to have we're actually
missing we're not we're not in a tribe of you know 50 to 150 people that we're interacting
with socially very well gov or mate's work and other people in attachment theory have shown
that loneliness is the main predictor of addiction and we are not physical as much and so there
there are kinds of stimuli that are healthy evolutionary stimuli that our world has made
less of and that hyponormal environment makes us susceptible to hypernormal which is why so many
people who are checking their phone all the time go to a festival with a bunch of friends and notice
they aren't checking their phone at all because they're actually actively engaged in something
that is meaningful and rich and whatever so one of the dynamics here will be the development of
the awareness and the discipline then the effectiveness of that that catches on one of the
other dynamics will be social reinforcement dynamics of people actually having more meaningful
engagement with each other and the positive feedback Luke like exercise has of epiphany
a better understanding and then more capacity to navigate and sovereignty as what the race
to the top as opposed to race to the bottom is so Daniel Schmockdenberger is the greatest
outlier of the thesis of TMP of anyone I've ever met I'm not kidding I'm not kidding
like the what you were just talking about there's you know Judd Brewer enough to know Judd Brewer but
he does a really nice job of outlining those practices and and its relationship to mindfulness
for example you know our our thing is a lot about the battle against the isolation emergency
that's the term we use and and it and it carries with it so many other attributes that you talk
about I mean it's very interesting because it truly is and you were referring to it earlier RP
like it's a competitive advantage in modern times in ways that it just it's never been
it's never been like not like not on this level because if you live in a state of like that constant
you know micro anxiety those people who actually have some kind of clarity man are they get you
know what a gift that they have anyway this has been great I've enjoyed it I would be happy to
come on and do another talk at some another dialogue at some point
