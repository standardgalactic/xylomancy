How do you get moral and political progress if you don't get truth?
If you have a situation where individuals can't agree on first principles.
Hello and welcome to The Enlightenment and Its Alternatives.
The Enlightenment advocated reason, science, democracy and universal human rights as a
grounding for human morality and social organization. In the quarter millennium since,
to what extent have these ideals been realized? Has the Enlightenment in fact
been successful in bringing about moral progress? Or are there viable alternatives
to the Enlightenment vision? Joining us to discuss this fascinating topic tonight are two
speakers who barely need introduction. Nevertheless, I will give you one all the same.
First of all, we have Steven Pinker. Steven is the John Stone
family professor of psychology at Harvard University and one of the most prominent
public intellectuals of our time. Steven is the author of Rationality, What It Is,
Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters and also Enlightenment Now, The Case for Reason,
Science, Humanism and Progress. Also joining us is John Mearsheimer. John is the R. Wendell
Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago
and is considered to be one of the most influential international relations theorists
of his generation. He is the author of How States Think, The Rationality of Foreign Policy
and The Great Delusion, Liberal Dreams and International Realities. Each speaker is going
to have around about five or so minutes to lay out their pitch for us and the provocation that
I'll be asking both of them to respond to is, we associate values such as universal liberty and
justice with the Enlightenment. Do they harm or hinder the world or do they help the world?
Now, Steven, I'm going to turn to you first. Enlightenment values, what do you think?
Thank you. So what are Enlightenment values or Enlightenment ideals? In a nutshell, I would say
it's the idea that we should use reason to improve human flourishing. What do I mean by reason? Well,
open deliberation, science, history, evaluation of ideas. And the fruits of reason have been
implemented in certain institutions, in particular liberal democracy, regulated markets, and
international institutions. That would be the Enlightenment ideal in a nutshell.
What do I mean by flourishing? Well, I mean things that each of us wants for ourselves and by
extension can't deny to others. Life, health, sustenance, prosperity, peace, freedom, safety,
knowledge, leisure, happiness. Now, ideals of the Enlightenment are not to be confused with the idea
that we should venerate some great men of the 18th century. They were just guys. It's the ideas that
count. And certainly not that we should exalt the West, because the West has always been ambivalent
in its commitment to Enlightenment ideals. There are plenty of counter-enlightenment themes that
have had great influence in the West. What are the alternatives? Well, of course, there's religion,
that we should obey God's commandments and holy scriptures. There's romantic nationalism and
authoritarianism, that nations embodied in strong leaders should strive for historic greatness.
There's various forms of zero-sum struggle that subjugated victim groups must overcome
aggressive groups and their reactionary ideologies that we should reject modernity
and return to a golden age. Has the Enlightenment worked? Well, we've had a quarter of millennium
to find out. We can compare what has happened in the last 250 years for the various dimensions of
human flourishing. So let's go to the data. Life expectancy worldwide for millennia
hovered around 30 years of age. Today, it is more than 70 years worldwide and more than 80 in
developed countries. Child mortality historically anywhere from a third to a fifth of children
died before the age of five. Now it is three-tenths of one percent, about four percent worldwide.
Famine was one of the horsemen of the apocalypse and could strike anywhere when there was a crop
failure. Today, famines have been decimated and occur only in war zones and in some autocracies.
Extreme poverty 200 years ago, about 90 percent of the world lived in what we would today call
extreme poverty. Today, it's less than 9 percent. Great power war, the 800-pound gorillas of the day
several hundred years ago were pretty much always at war. Today, they are never at war. The last
great power war pitted the US against China in Korea 70 years ago. Democracy, there used to be
a handful of democracies. Now a slight majority of countries are democratic, even with the
democratic recession of the last decade or so. All the great states and empires used to
meet out justice by gruesome forms of torture, like crucifixion, breaking on the wheel,
disembowelment. But during the Enlightenment, there was a wave of abolition of judicial torture,
including the United States prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Slavery used to be
ubiquitous. All the great states and empires practiced it. Starting in the Enlightenment,
there was a trickle of abolition that grew into a flood. Today, slavery is not legal anywhere on
earth. Homicide in Europe used to be about 35 per 100,000 per year. In Europe now, it's about
1 per 100,000 per year. Other parts of the world are more dangerous, but they've also seen declines.
Used to be that about 10 percent of the world was literate a couple of hundred years ago. Now,
it's closer to 90 percent, especially if you look at people under the age of 25. And it used to be
that about less than a fifth of the world had a basic education. Today, it's almost four-fifths.
Also today, countries that are guided by Enlightenment ideals, and I would roughly
identify those with liberal democracies, are, according to our best data, the healthiest countries,
the safest in terms of safety from violent crime and war, the cleanest in terms of measures of
environmental quality, the happiest. And they are the most popular destination of people who vote
with their feet. People want to go to liberal democracies if they possibly have the opportunity.
I'll leave the case of the Enlightenment at that for now and look forward to hear what John has to say.
I want to make it clear that I'm not arguing that there has been no progress since 1680,
which is when the Enlightenment started. And I'm not arguing that the Enlightenment didn't
contribute to some of that progress, some of which Steve described in his presentation.
My argument has to do with the question of whether or not the Enlightenment has led to
moral and political progress. And when we talk about moral and political progress,
we're talking about first principles. We're talking about questions regarding the good life.
And the question is, has the Enlightenment created a situation where there is large-scale
consensus, almost overwhelming consensus, on questions about first principles, on questions
about the good life. That would be evidence, in my opinion, of moral progress. And I think that's
an argument that Steve makes in his work, that we have achieved both moral and political progress
as a result of the Enlightenment. And I, of course, disagree with that. And I want to make
three points. First of all, the core argument is that unfettered reason leads individuals to come
to agreement about questions regarding the good life. In other words, unfettered reason, or what
Steve calls the escalator of reason, leads us toward truth. It leads us towards agreement on
first principles. And therefore, we make moral and political progress. My argument is that unfettered
reason involving lots of individuals does not lead to agreement. In fact, it leads to significant
disagreement. People cannot agree about first principles. They cannot agree about questions
regarding the political goods. They cannot agree about questions regarding justice. And
therefore, you're not making moral and political progress. And in fact, this is why politics is
so important. If you look at Steve's work, politics is not very important, because he believes that
in the end, you're getting large-scale agreement on these central questions. My argument is you
don't get central agreement. You get disagreement. And sometimes, that disagreement is so fervent
that people end up killing each other. And this is why politics is so important in my story.
My second point is that people who focus on the Enlightenment focus on the individualism.
Radical individualism is associated with the Enlightenment. My view is that human beings
are social animals to begin with who carve out room for their individualism. But because they're
social animals to begin with, human beings belong to tribes. Today, we call them nations.
Human beings are very tribal. And when you're in a tribe or you're in a nation, your identity is
inextricably bound up with that nation. You have interest. You have ways of looking at the world.
You have views about what is just and what is not just that are bound up with being a member
of that nation. So in the end, what that means is that sense that individuals are parts of nations
and nations disagree on first principles makes it even harder to reach agreement on what are
moral and political answers to the big questions in life. Then finally, there's the matter of
international relations. I actually believe that people who focus on the Enlightenment argue,
a la Immanuel Kant, that by using reason, we can come up with what Kant called perpetual peace.
I don't believe that at all. I believe that because the international system is anarchic,
which is to say that there's no higher authority in that system. The state uses reason to think
about how to survive in that system. And of course, survival has to be its principal goal.
That state and other states are going to engage in security competition. And that security
competition is sometimes going to lead to war. So in an anarchic system like the international
system, basically, you have a situation where reason leads not to peace, but it leads to competition
and sometimes deadly conflict. So it's for those three reasons that I disagree with the argument
that the Enlightenment leads to consensus, to some sort of truth about political and moral factors.
Thank you. So, Steve, if I could return to you and just picking up on John's arguments here,
is politics slightly missing from the account you've given us so far? I mean, it looked
incredibly rosy and very optimistic even. But is there some political context that have been
missing? For example, are liberal democracies attractive? Because actually, historically
speaking, they were colonial powers and the countries that are not so attractive were put
into very difficult economic situations by successful and quite aggressive states,
which are now liberal democracies. Is there any scope for agreed frameworks for reasoning and
shared decision making that could lead to the kind of accumulated collective progress
that Enlightenment seems to feel is necessary? Oh, absolutely. It's called democracy. The Enlightenment
thinkers were obsessed with how you could have a political organization that is not vested in,
say, an absolute monarch with divinely granted powers. And the ideals, such as free speech
and democracy, were absolutely predicated on the fact that people do disagree. There is absolutely no
presumption that everyone has the same values or the same beliefs. That's why you need democracy.
That is, given that people aren't going to agree, how are we going to govern ourselves?
On the other hand, it's important not to exaggerate how much disagreement there is compared to, say,
250 or 500 years ago, compared to, say, the era of the wars of religion.
The world's nations did sign the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and it has informed
dozens of scores of constitutions. So the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is
pretty detailed, and you've got every country signing on to it, sometimes in the breach,
sometimes hypocritically. But a lot of the ideals actually command pretty wide assent,
but not a universal assent. There are still, of course, religious fanatics. There are still
authoritarian despots. There are still glory-mad expansionist leaders. But the ideals of the
Enlightenment are not a guarantee that everyone will come around, but they are arguments about
which way we ought to be heading. In terms of individualism, another point that John mentioned,
among the individual needs, benefits is belonging to a group, belonging to a family,
having friends, belonging to institutions, belonging to organizations. There's nothing
about recognizing the right of individuals that contradicts the idea that we like to
belong to groups, as long as they don't coerce us, as long as we can leave those groups.
And that includes nations. It is true that people belong to nations, but not everyone
in a nation agrees with everyone else in the nation. That's why we have arguments and political
parties and contested elections, and people who come and go and leave and disagree with their
leaders unless they're threatened with jail for doing so. It is exactly a precept of the Enlightenment
in its commitment to democracy that people within a nation actually disagree with each other,
and that the fact that the nation might have a religion, an ideology, doesn't mean that it is
right for every last individual to be coerced into conforming to it. And we know historically,
and from current events, people don't. There's lots of dissent in every country, as long as it's
allowed. In terms of whether the competition for security means that we will perpetually be at war,
I mean, that predicts that the rate of war should be at pretty much a constant level throughout
history. And it's not. It's gone way down, especially since the end of the Second World War.
And the rates go up and down, I think, depending in good part on nations' commitments to
Enlightenment ideals versus thirst for glory and grandeur and preeminence. That's a variable that
we see goes up and down and varies from country to country. Countries that used to be at each other's
throats for centuries or millennia have decided that they'd be better off cooperating. So that
can happen too. I don't think that the nature of the international system pins us to a constant
level of war at every period in history. Steve, I think if you read your book carefully and you
read Better Angels, your other important book, from my point of view, carefully, it's very clear
that you talk about truth and allowing truth to prevail. That's language from your book, right?
Approaching the truth, yes. We don't know what it is, but we try to get there.
I would just say that how do you get moral and political progress if you don't get truth?
If you have a situation where individuals can't agree on first principles and they battle it out,
I mean, look at the United States today, the red versus blue divide. And we could point to all sorts
of other examples like this. How do you make progress, right? It just seems to me that progress
is inextricably bound up with the concept of truth. Now, when you talk about it, you point to progress
as the coming of liberalism. And in fact, you say that there is this escalator of reason out there.
And you say explicitly that we're getting smarter. And you say explicitly that getting
smarter means you become liberal, right? So it looks like in your story to me that the truth
is becoming a liberal, establishing a liberal society. And I think that's a hard argument to make.
I like liberalism very much. I'm thrilled. I'm ecstatic about the fact that I was born into
liberal America, right? So I'm not against liberalism. But as you well know, there are a lot of people
on the planet who don't like liberalism at all. There are many opponents of liberalism. And if
you look at what's been happening on the planet with regard to liberalism, liberal democracies
have been decreasing since 2006. So it doesn't look like such a rosy picture. But my more important
point is, do you really want to identify progress with liberalism and argue that anybody who opposes
liberalism is therefore in the wrong? Yeah. So I would identify progress really with human
flourishing. Now, some of those ideals like freedom do overlap with liberalism. And I'd be
prepared to argue that they're better values. But some of them like living longer, kids not dying,
mothers not dying in childbirth, people not getting stabbed to death in muggings,
people not getting thrown in jail because they disagree with the king. I think those are,
I get some of those are liberal values, equality of women. There are a lot of people who don't
agree with the idea of equality of women, to put it mildly. But I would argue that those,
so there's some that I think are universally agreed upon, such as health, longevity,
the sustenance. There are some that are where there are holdouts, but there is still a pretty
significant trend, such as equality of women. The countries that deny women the vote have been
dwindling. So the only one left is the Vatican. The direction in terms of laws that discriminate
against women is that they are falling off the books. The countries that have laws that criminalize
homosexuality are liberalizing that. So actually, I think there is actually a trend towards
liberal values. And I think they are most defensible. That is, if you have an open discussion,
an open argument, if people from different backgrounds have to come together and decide
what they agree upon, which they're motivated to do in order to have a global community where
they're not at each other's throats, then they do tend to settle on certain universal values.
And the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most obvious example. If someone were to say
that the first universal principle is we accept Jesus Christ as our savior, well, a lot of people
are going to fall by the wayside. But if it's that people should have an education, that people
shouldn't be jailed because of their opinions, then it's much harder for someone to argue against
them. And historically, that's why I think liberal values in general have actually have
increased. You're right that democracy has stalled in the last 15 years or so. But still,
as the graph that I threw up before showed, it has stalled. It may even have gone down a bit,
but it's still way higher than it was 20 years ago to say nothing of 50 years ago, 100 years ago,
200 years ago. But there's not a consensus there. That's the point. But I just want to
go a step further on this. One of the points that's clear from reading your book
is that you believe that if you go to the academy, academia, the world that you and I operate in,
there are huge numbers of people who you think are at odds with your way of looking at the world.
These are people who are not using reason for good ends. If the academy where you would expect
people to privilege reason is filled with individuals who think in ways that you think are
contrary to producing progress, how can you argue that we're moving in a positive direction?
And it's not only that, the academy that you point to, you also point to a large number
of great thinkers, people who enjoy great esteem in the academy, people like Foucault,
people like Fanon, people like Nietzsche, as people who are hindering progress, people who are
getting in the way. You also argue that anybody who believes in these isms, these ideologies,
is asking for trouble. Ideologies are also a hindrance to progress on the moral and political
front. Given this panoply of forces that are acting in ways that are contrary to your argument,
how can you argue we're making progress? I'd be the first to say that there are a lot of
pathologies in a number of our institutions, not least the one that employs the two of us.
And in that regard, your institution is doing a whole lot better than mine. University of Chicago
comes close to the top in rankings for freedom of expression and Harvard comes close to the bottom.
I'm working to try to change that. The most general answer to your question is,
a belief that there has been progress is not a belief that everything gets better
everywhere for everyone all the time. That wouldn't be progress. That would be a miracle.
And I don't believe in miracles. Progress is incremental. It has setbacks. It has to,
because it's not a force of the universe. You're right that there was a conception of
progress as some mystical force that carries us ever upward. That's not what I'm advocating at
all. Quite the contrary. Most of the forces of the universe are trying to grind us down.
And we push back with deliberation, with reason, with argument, with evidence.
And there's no guarantee of success. Sometimes brute force wins. Sometimes people are under
the spell of delusions or blingent ideologies. So there's no, the idea that the normative argument
of what we ought to do and the descriptive argument of where we are are separate. It could be that
there are certain things we ought to do and not enough people are doing them and they should change
and we should try to persuade them to change. But yeah, things can go wrong. And in some places,
things have gone wrong. I think on average we're better off now than we were 100 years ago or
200 years ago to say nothing of 2,000 years ago. But yeah, stuff happens. Things go wrong.
Progress is not always the getting it right and accumulating that rightness. Maybe it's the
understanding more about how you might go about getting it right. John, is that a convincing
argument for you? No, but my point, Sophie, is that for an academic like you, an academic like
Steve, and an academic like me, we should realize that deliberation and reason in different individuals
leads to different conclusions about what is the political or moral good. At all of our universities,
what you find are huge numbers of people who are very smart, who have truly impressive
critical faculties, who can't agree on much of anything. Yeah, I mean, I think that that's a
bit of an exaggeration. There's certainly plenty of disagreement. There's no question. But how many,
and again, by the way, I don't want to distinguish academia, which is an institution,
which as we both agree, has some pathologies. But that's not the same as the larger, say,
Republic of Letters, the intellectual sphere, which also includes think tanks and publications and
newspapers and independent bloggers and so on. But even within academia, there's not a whole
lot of people who would give a defense of a return to traditional gender roles that women
should be kept out of the workplace, or that homosexuality should be criminalized, or that
war is heroic and manly and thrilling and spiritual, and that humanity will become decrepit if we
ever have peace. Arguments that people used to have that are pretty much obsolete, that we should
have racial segregation, that we should look to the Bible as a source of history as opposed to
science. There's plenty that we agree on, and there is certainly a pretty big froth of disagreement
on top. But there is intellectual progress in the sense that there are crazy superstitions that
were pretty and monstrous beliefs that people by and large have abandoned, at least in arenas where
you can make arguments about them. So, Johnny, are you confident that things aren't going to slip
backwards again, or do you see new myths forming to replace the old ones? Well, it's not so much
myths. Again, I think that reason can lead individuals to come up with smart views that
the world works in one way, and lead other individuals to come up with smart views that
the world works in other ways. In international relations, the world I operate in, I have a
particular theory of realism. I argue that realism best explains how the world works.
Steve is a very smart guy, and he uses his critical faculties to think about how the
world works, and he comes up with a fundamentally different view of international politics than
I do. It's what I would call a liberal view. And that is my basic point, that smart individuals
can use their critical faculties to come up with different views. And when you have different views,
how do you have progress? The fact that Steve and I disagree about international progress,
about international relations, makes me wonder whether it makes sense to talk about us achieving
progress in understanding how the world works. If we take, say, the history of science as our guide.
