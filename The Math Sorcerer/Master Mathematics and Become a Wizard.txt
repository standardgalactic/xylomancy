In this video, I'm going to show you how you can become a mathematical wizard.
You can basically break down all of mathematics into four levels.
Level one is the apprentice. At this level, you are focusing on learning basic mathematics.
By basic mathematics, I mean pre-algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, calculus,
trigonometry, pre-calculus, basic stuff that you learn. And most people are at the apprentice
level. One thing that characterizes this level from the other levels is that apprentices do not
know how to write proofs. This is all computational based mathematics. The emphasis is to gain as
much exposure and as much practice as you can so that when you go to the next levels,
you have a strong foundation. In this video, I'm going to give you books that you can use
to master the apprentice level. Level two is the magician. Magicians are focused on learning to write
mathematical proofs. This is a struggle. It is one of the hardest things that people who are
learning math have to do, but it is worth the struggle because once you learn to write mathematical
proofs, you can progress to level three and become a warlock and start learning all kinds of mathematics.
In this video, I'm going to show you some books that you can use to progress to the next level
of warlock. Level three is the warlock. This is the level where you are trying to learn
all of the undergraduate mathematics that you can and it is still a struggle. You still encounter
situations where you're not sure if your proofs are correct. You have doubts and you don't know
if what you're doing is correct, but at the same time, you have some ability. You have the ability
to write mathematical proofs and you've made it this far in the progression. You're actually
writing proofs. You're just not a master yet. Warlocks can learn all kinds of math on their own,
but it's still a struggle and that's what separates warlocks from wizards.
Wizards have an easier time learning higher level mathematics. At level four, you are a mathematical
wizard. You have the ability to pick up any book on mathematics and learn mathematics on your own.
This is the highest level of mathematics. This is research level mathematics. It doesn't mean you
have to do research. It just means that you have the ability to absorb and learn higher level
mathematics on your own. This is where you want to be and this is where you want to get because
you can always learn math from previous levels when you get to this level and the world becomes yours.
You become a mathematical wizard.
This is a good starting point for someone who has been away from mathematics for a very long time.
The subject is pre-algebra and almost all of these books are widely available. So these first two
are easy to find. You can find them online and I'll try to leave links in the description.
I will also try to look for this one in case you want to check it out. So this book here,
Essential Pre-Algebra, Skills Practice Workbook by Chris McMullen, PhD, is a great book because it
has answers to every single problem and so you can work through it and check your work. You can
also write in this book. It's an actual workbook. It is not really considered a textbook, but it's
quite affordable and it's worth it if you're trying to brush up your pre-algebra skills.
Another really good widely available modern book is this one here. Everything you need to ace
pre-algebra and algebra one in one big fat notebook. This book is really fun. It teaches you a lot of
mathematics and it's got really, really cool pictures. So perfect for someone who is just trying to get
back into mathematics. The last one I want to show you is Pre-Algebra by Harry H. Jonas. I wanted
to include this one because it's kind of a collectible. It's got a really cool cover and it's from
the early 70s. So if you want an old-school approach to mathematics, you can try to find this
book. And again, I'll look for every single book in this video and I'll do my best to leave links
in the description if I can find the books. Another subject that people who are studying
level one mathematics study is geometry. So here I have three books. The first one being Shams Outline
of Geometry. This book is widely available and is a great reference for geometry. So it's worth
having in your mathematical library. In fact, that's the only reason I have it. It's just a good
reference. It pretty much has everything you're going to need when you're studying other subjects.
If you need some geometry, it's probably in this book. If you want a book that is a great choice
for self-study, this is it. Everything you need to ace geometry in one big fat notebook. This book
will guide you through everything. It has great illustrations, examples, and it has answers to
every single problem. This is an awesome book for learning basic geometry. I had to include a
collectible book in this list. And so here we have Geometry by Fisher and Hayden. And this book
has some really interesting topics. I think this is way more advanced than the other books. It's
also harder to find, but I'll do my best to find it. Look at that. Geometry on the surface of the
sphere. You get all kinds of mathematics that you don't see in other books, in old geometry books,
like this one. Curved surfaces, area and volume, mapping, similarity, congruence, and symmetry.
Yeah, really old school book. Okay, let's go ahead and go through the rest of these books
really, really quickly so we can get to level two. This one is everything you need to ace math
in one big fat notebook. This is a highly accessible book. It's widely available, and it has answers
to all of the problems. This is a book that you can use to learn basic mathematics. Speaking of
basic mathematics, we have the legendary basic mathematics by Serge Lang. This book is really
unique because it has tons of topics. And while this is considered level one mathematics, just be
warned, it does have some proof based exercises. Elementary statistics is a subject that most
people study in college. So it's definitely a level one mathematics. This is a highly computational
stats book that is worth owning and worth reading if you are trying to learn statistics.
Mathematical ideas. This is a book that you've probably never seen. This covers random math topics,
but again, the level is pretty basic. So if you're in this level, if you feel like you can
understand some of this material, you can definitely pick up this book and learn all kinds of cool
mathematics. This is the Shams outline on probability and statistics. And this book is great for
learning probability and statistics. It has really good examples and it has answers to a lot of the
exercises. It's a great choice for self studying probability and stats. This book is used in
courses such as pre calculus and trigonometry at various colleges. It's called algebra and
trigonometry. And it's the second edition. It's by Stuart Redlin and Watson. I'm pretty sure there's
a newer edition, but this book contains a behemoth of information. There was just so much math in
this book. And a lot of people are at this level. This is what you study like before you take a
calculus class. Here's a book that is just on trig. So a lot of the books cover algebra and trig,
but this one is just trig. It's the one by McKee and Turner. This is one of the best intermediate
algebra books ever written. It's the one by Blitzer. Blitzer is a great author. His books are very
easy to understand compared to a lot of the other books. And that's why they are so widely used at
colleges today. So they're just solid books. This is a big, thick book on intermediate algebra. It's
going to give you answers to all of the odd numbered exercises. And this is a textbook, right? I want
to emphasize that this is a textbook. So if you compare this to other books that are not textbooks,
you're going to get a lot more information in a book like this. This book is a workbook. It is
not a textbook. It's called trigonometry essentials practice workbook with answers, master basic
trig skills. This was written by Chris McMullen, PhD. And this book is a workbook. So it has
exercises and it has answers to all of the exercises. And you can write in the book. So
it's a great supplement to an actual textbook on trigonometry. Here's another choice for
intermediate algebra. This is the one by Alan R. Angel, solid book for learning basic mathematics.
It's good stuff. Okay, let's quickly go through the rest of these. We've got algebra essentials
practice workbook with answers. This one is a workbook. So really good for people who are trying
to, you know, get better at basic math. It's got answers to all of the exercises. And you can
write in it. So this is a step up above his pre algebra book. I like this book. I think it's
worth it. And it's very, very affordable. If you want something more comprehensive, you can take
a look at something like this one. This one is college algebra essentials by blitzer essentials
means that it's missing some of the sections that the regular college algebra has. That's okay.
It's a lot more affordable. And it's an actual textbook. Okay, so it's got like some serious
math in it. It's got definitions. It's got tons of exercises. And you get answers to all of the
odd numbered problems. This is an excellent choice for someone who is trying to get better at algebra.
If you feel you're not here yet, you can take a step back and look at something like this
intermediate algebra. This is the one by Miller O'Neill and Hyde. This is actually the first book
I ever had on math because I use this for the first math class I ever took. And I remember
struggling, but it's a pretty good book. And it's the one I use to get started with mathematics.
And if you're looking for something more exotic, of course, I like to include collectible books in
my videos. We have intermediate algebra for college students by Lewis Lighthold. So Lewis Lighthold
was the inspiration for the real life Jaime Escalante from the 80s movie stand and deliver.
So if you've seen stand and deliver, the main character was inspired by Lewis Lighthold. This
guy was a legend and he wrote legendary books. And this book is pretty rare, but I'll try to find it.
Now we have entered the world of calculus. So here we have Serge Lang's a first course in calculus.
This is the third edition. There is a much newer edition available. And this book is pretty good.
It's got all kinds of interesting topics, but it's not going to have everything you need maybe
for your courses in college, but it does have a lot of mathematics in it. And it is going to make
you better. Another really interesting book we have here is differential equations with linear
algebra. So this is a book that teaches differential equations. And also it has some linear algebra.
In order to read this book, you want to know some calculus. So this is like the top level
of level one, like you're almost at level two, you know, once you get past differential equations,
that's really when you start approaching level two mathematics. This is a classic book on calculus.
It's part of a series called mathematics for self-study. And it's written by Thompson. It's
called calculus for the practical man. This is the book or one of the books that the noble prize
winning physicist Richard Feynman used to teach himself calculus. This is another workbook. It's
called essential calculus skills practice workbook. So this is one of those books that you can buy
and basically use this to get a better grade in your class, right? Because these problems are
carefully picked and they seem to be exercises that you would put on a test. You know, if I was
teaching a calculus class, I would, you know, these are the types of test questions people would
probably see or questions like this. So it's a great book if you're trying to get better at calculus.
Everyone needs a big, thick calculus book in my opinion. And this is a great book. It's called
calculus and it's by Anton a new horizon. This basically has everything you need for calculus
one, calculus two and calculus three. So you could take three semesters of calculus with this book.
It's a huge, thick math book. Here we have a differential equations book. This is one that
I have actually used to teach differential equations to college students in the past.
This is a pretty good book. I've read portions of it and I've done most of the exercises
from various sections in this book. I'd say it's a pretty good book on differential equations
and one worth trying if you're trying to learn the subject. We've got three big calculus books
left in level one. We've got calculus with analytic geometry by Swakowski. Super thick book again
contains all the calculus you need. Then we've got the calculus by Lewis Lighthold. This one is
more rare because it's by Lewis Lighthold. But I believe there is a newer edition and I'll try to
leave that info in the description. This is a legendary book. This book really changed the way
calculus books are written because it was the first book to really provide really clean examples
and become popular. There might have been some other books that came before this one
that were written in this format but none I'm aware of. This last one has a really cool psychedelic
cover. It's called Calculus and it was written by Ellis and Gullick. I love the cover of this book.
Level two mathematics, the magician. This is where you are trying to learn to write mathematical
proofs. So what does it take to get to level two? It actually takes very little. It's all about you.
If you decide that you feel like you know enough algebra and calculus and trig and differential
equations and you are ready to enter the world of proof-based mathematics, then by all means
jump into it and become a magician. Most people never see level two mathematics. It's really only
math majors that have to take courses where they learn to write proofs. But once you master level
two mathematics or at least get very good at it, you can jump to level three. Let's take a quick
look at some of the books in level two. This is one of the first proof writing books I ever
purchased. It's called Mathematical Proofs, a transition to advanced mathematics by Chartrand,
Palomini, and Zhang. This book will teach you to write mathematical proofs. I think it's a great
book. The biggest downside of this book might be the cost. It's a little expensive, but I think
it's worth every penny. It's an excellent book for learning to write mathematical proofs. Perhaps
a more affordable option is Proofs by Jay Cummings. And I reviewed this book in the past
and Jay actually left a comment in the video. I thought that was really, really cool.
This is a great book for learning to write proofs and it's super, super thick. I definitely
recommend this book. This one is free. That's right. You can actually get this book for free
on the internet. You can just search for a book of proof and you can download the book.
You might be wondering, if it's free, why do I have a copy? Because I decided to buy a physical
copy. I wanted to have a physical copy that I could touch and feel and so I went online and I
bought one. So great book for learning to write proofs. I have read a few of the sections and
I've probably done like 20 or 30 exercises from this book and I think it's great. It's an excellent
book for learning to write proofs. It is one of the better ones and it's free. I think this might
be my favorite. I really hate to say it and I hate to admit it because I hesitated hard. I did not
want to buy this book, but people kept mentioning it last year in the comments and I caved and I
bought it and it's great. This book has really good explanations and it's small so you can lay in
bed and read it. How to prove it, a structured approach by Velman. He gives really crystal
clear explanations of how to write mathematical proofs. Here is one that was recommended to me
by a former professor. It's called How to Read and Do Proofs by Daniel Solow. Several of the
people here on the channel have used this book and have praised it. It is a solid book on learning
to write proofs and this is the last one I want to show you on proof writing. It's called An Introduction
to Abstract Mathematics by Bond and Keane. I like this book a lot probably because I've spent so
much time reading it and working through it. I think it's a great book and another solid choice
for learning to write proofs. The bad news is in order to progress to level three you really want
to have a strong command of proof writing. You should at least know how to write basic proofs
and that is hard. It takes a lot of time and effort and that's why these books will help you.
If you're wondering which books should you get, I say get all of them if you can. If you are tight
on money, get the free one. You can just download it and if you have to pick one to buy, I'm going
to say get this one here. How to prove it, a structured approach. I really really think
this is the best choice for anyone who is trying to learn to write proofs and it's hard for me to
say that because all of these books are so good and they're all great books. None of them are
bad books. These are not bad books. They're all great but this one is just a little bit better
and I really like the size. You can kind of like lay in bed and read it. He just has really good
explanations. Daniel Bellman does a wonderful job in his book. All right let's go to level three
mathematics. This is where it gets really really interesting. This is level three mathematics,
the warlock. You can see how many books we have here because at this point you know how to write
mathematical proofs and once you know how to write proofs the world is yours. So this is mathematics
that typically math majors would study. So if you go to a college or a university anywhere in the
world these are some of the things you would study. So let's take a quick look at some of the books
I have here because there are so many books and so many topics. Real analysis by Jay Cummings.
If you recall Jay Cummings wrote the proof book we talked about earlier. This is an
excellent book on real analysis and it's very very affordable compared to some of the other books.
Look how thick that is. Super nice book on real analysis. You definitely want to know
how to write proofs before jumping into real analysis. Basically you're going to be doing
something similar to calculus that you've done before but you're going to be proving everything
which makes it much more challenging. I wanted to include discrete mathematics in level three
because I feel like there are some proofs in here where you would benefit from already having
some proof background in particular in this book here. So I have them here in increasing order of
difficulty. For beginners we have discrete mathematical structures by Coleman, Busby and Ross.
This is a really nice book and it's very good for beginners who are studying discrete math.
What is discrete math? Well it covers logic, sets, counting, probability, proofs, statistics,
graph theory, tons of topics combined into one subject which is called discrete mathematics.
This one is very affordable. It's a Dover book. Dover is a company that reprints old math books
and makes them more affordable. It's called Introductory Discrete Mathematics by Balakrishnan.
This book is significantly more challenging than this one. I've read various portions of this book
and it's a great book and it's affordable. This one is a Game Changer Concrete Mathematics,
a foundation for computer science written by legends, right? Graham Neuth Potashnik.
These people are legendary and this is a legendary book. This book is no joke. It is super hard
and it definitely warrants level three mathematics. This is warlock level and it's got answers to
all of the problems, right? Like not just answers but like solutions. It's awesome. Awesome book but
it is no joke. One of the things that characterizes level three mathematics being a warlock is again
your ability to write proofs. If you can write proofs in theory you can pick up any of these books
and you can start reading and you can start learning mathematics. That's why it is such a big deal
to master level two. For example, let's just start looking at some of these books. This is Advanced
Calculus by Creighton Buck. Solid book. This one teaches Advanced Calculus but it introduces it
from a multivariable and a single variable approach right from the beginning. So it makes it great
for learning Advanced Calculus. There are easier Advanced Calculus books but I do like this one
and it's probably one of my favorites if not my favorite. Here's another book we have and this
one's on partial differential equations. This is the one I actually used when I studied partial
differential equations. It's pretty good. It's got some typos in the solutions but it's pretty good.
Two more for PDEs. We've got Introduction to Partial Differential Equations. This is the one
by Greenspan and then we've got another one here by Zac Manoglo and Tho. This is a Dover book so
it's super super affordable. Introduction to Real Analysis by Bartle and Sherbert. This book is
interesting because I checked this out from the library several years ago and I forgot what book
it was. I thought I like this book. I don't remember what it's called and then one day I found it and
I bought it and it's a great book. It's really really good for beginners. This is definitely easier
than the book by Buck on Advanced Calculus. This gives you a much more introductory approach
plus it's got a really really cool cover right Bartle and Sherbert. Let's take a look at this
pile here. We've got Introduction to Probability by John E. Frund. This is a little bit more advanced
so it definitely warrants level three in my opinion. The subject of number theory. This is the book
by Long. This is a classic. I love this book. This is the first number theory book I purchased
and it will teach you number theory but again you want to know how to write proofs. Here we have a
more advanced book on probability and statistics for engineers. Here we have a wonderful book on
analysis. Again great for beginners. The one by Steven Abbott. Wonderful book. Numerical analysis.
That's right. Numerical analysis is something you can learn and study once you become a warlock
and this is a book that you can use to do it. Another numerical analysis book and this one's a
little bit more rare and I don't know if you can see it but it says usually there. Numerical methods
that usually work. It's by Foreman Acton. What a cool name. Over here we have some more advanced
books. Advanced Calculus by Fitzpatrick. This is the one I used as an undergraduate. Very tough
but it's probably one of the easiest books for beginners. Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kuhns.
This is proof based linear algebra. Old school book. I included the legendary Spivak in level three
because it really really helps if you know some proof writing before you jump into Michael Spivak's
legendary book. Over here we have another pile. Let's take a look at it. Complex Analysis. For this
you're going to want to know how to write proofs and you're going to want to know some calculus.
Beautiful subject. One of the nicest subjects you can study as an undergrad. This is the one by
Saffin Snyder. Pricy book but worth it. I think this is easier than the Brown book which I actually
don't have in this video and it's more popular than this one but this one I think is the easiest one
for complex analysis. An entire book on logic. That's right an entire book. That's something
you don't see often. It's the one by McCollough's. An abstract algebra book. I love this book.
And another proof based linear algebra book. This one's a little more modern so
you can think of this as a modern version of the book by Hoffman and Kuhns.
Let's take a quick look at some warlock level books. We've got Introduction to Probability and
its Applications by Schaefer. This is a great book and you can find a solutions manual for it as
well. Great for mathematical statistics. This one is good too but it doesn't have answers
and this is the India edition. It's the one by Rice. Then we have a legendary book on abstract
algebra by Israel Nathan Herstein. Lovely book. I had a friend who worshiped this book.
Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin. This is one that is again legendary. Very hard to read.
Very rigorous. Rudin doesn't really explain things in a very nice way but it's still a famous book.
It's got like a cult following. My favorite abstract algebra book for beginners by Dan Sericino.
Probably the most popular topology book in the world. Topology by Monqueries.
So you can learn topology once you get to level three. Once you become a warlock.
This is kind of like the high end of level three. Topology is tough. Once you get past
topology you're really getting close to level four. Then we've got a classic here on Advanced
Calculus by Hildebrand. Calculus of several variables by Goffman going quickly here. We
still got to get to level four. I have way too many books. Well there's no such thing.
Here's a hardcore book by Weatherburn. Mathematical Statistics.
Naive Set Theory by Paul Helmholtz. Applied Componentorix by Fred Roberts. A whole book
on Componentorix. And Advanced Engineering Mathematics by Zill. This is the same author
of the Differential Equations book which I was showing you earlier. The bad thing about this
book is that it's a little bit pricey. Notice I have this international edition. Yeah these
can get pricey but these books have so much content. Let's take a look at this last pile.
Introductory Real Analysis. This is by Kolmogorov and Fomin. This is a Dover book. Hardcore.
I included this one because it's kind of strange, right? Plain and spherical trigonometry. This is
not really taught in schools anymore but I feel that having more maturity before reading this book
will help you appreciate it more. That's why I put it in level three. We've got two abstract
algebra books both great for beginners. The one by Frele and the one by Pinter. And then we have
a classic book on functions of several variables. This is the one by Fleming. This book is beautiful.
This is a beautiful book. If you can find it, buy it. It's just wonderful. We've got some more
statistics. Mathematical statistics. Two books here. One by Rost and one by Frund. Another partial
differential equations book. This is the one by Miller. Great book. A book on combinatorics by
Tucker. A book on graph three by Gold. And an advanced calculus book by Fuchs. I have this
book by Fuchs in Spanish actually which is really interesting. I have the Spanish version of this
book. So how do you get to level four mathematics? How do you become a wizard? Well basically you
want to have a lot of exposure to most of these topics. You don't have to know everything here
but you have to have some exposure to advanced calculus, to linear algebra, to topology,
to complex variables. At least know the very basics of number theory. Just having exposure and
knowing how to write proofs in these subjects will help propel you to level four. Most people
need a mathematics degree in order to get to level four because this is what you learn with
a math degree. You cover a lot of this information and so to self-study this takes an eternity but
I think it's possible. I really think it is because people can do it. People have done it and you can
do it. You can become a mathematical wizard. Okay let's go to level four.
This is level four mathematics, the wizard. You know you're at level four when you feel like you
have had plenty of exposure to topics such as abstract algebra, advanced calculus, linear algebra
and you feel like you can pick up one of those books and you can read it and you can learn on
your own. When you're at the point where you feel like you can pick up an undergraduate level
math book and sit down and read it and learn, that's when it's time for level four and that's
graduate level because that's what you have to be able to do at the graduate level. You have to be
able to learn new mathematics on your own. Let's take a look at some of these books so you can see
what kind of mathematics wizards do. So measure theory by Halmos is a legendary book. Paul Halmos
was a very famous mathematician. He passed away several years ago and he wrote many amazing books.
Measure theory is something that first-year graduate students see when they go to graduate school.
It is extremely difficult and extremely hard and if you are thinking about learning measure theory,
my advice is get every single book that you can afford on measure theory and find every single
resource you can and do your best. Here's another book by Halmos. This is called a Hilbert Space
problem book and it's exactly what it says it is. It's a problem book on Hilbert spaces.
It's got tons of problems and it's got tons of solutions. It's an excellent book for someone
looking for hard mathematical problems on Hilbert spaces. Then we have an advanced book on functional
analysis by Narichi. Pretty hardcore stuff here. Definitely want to be a wizard before you learn
this. Another super hardcore book on functional analysis by Rudin. This one is really, really
tough and the easiest functional analysis book ever written in my opinion. The one by Kreizig.
So all great books on functional. This is the easiest one. Then you get weird stuff like piece-wise
linear topology. That is definitely wizard level. Not something you've probably even heard of.
Analytic topology. Again, something that you've probably never seen. This is the one by Wyburn.
Topics in ring theory by Barshay. Very, very advanced book on ring theory. Algebraic number
theory by Weiss. Again, very advanced stuff. Then we have another book here. Hilbert spaces
by Berberian. Classic book. Abelian Varieties by Serge Lang. Serge Lang is one of my favorite
authors. I collect his books and that's actually why I have this book. Abelian Varieties. So super
advanced stuff that only wizards study. Differential geometry is something that could considerably be
level three because a lot of people see it as an undergrad. But I threw it into level four because
most people don't see differential geometry as undergrads. It's not taught at most schools. It's
not something that's typically taught. So it's a little bit more niche. So I threw it into the
graduate level. Algebraic topology. That's definitely grad level. This is super hard stuff.
This is a graduate level book on abstract algebra. And I included it here because of that. But you
can use this as a beginner. Nevertheless, for the amount of content it has, it's definitely wizard
material. Topology of manifolds. Again, super advanced stuff here. Real and complex analysis.
This is by Walter Rudin. This is called Papa Rudin. The baby Rudin is the principles of
mathematical analysis book we saw earlier. This teaches you measure theory. And it's a very,
very hard book. And it's a very good book. Algebra by Hungerford. I like this book. I know some
people don't. I'm a big fan of this book. Methods of the functions of several complex variables.
So earlier we saw a complex analysis book by Sath and Snyder. That's for a single complex
variable. This one covers several complex variables. So the math is way more advanced. In fact,
many schools don't even teach this stuff. It's so advanced. And that's true for a lot of these
topics. Functional analysis or short course. That's a great book. A book on variational analysis.
This is super advanced. Algebraic extensions of fields. Look at that. Beautiful. Another measure
theory book. This is the one again by Halmos. It's a different edition. And over here we have
analytic function theory by Hill. So you can see these books here contain topics that are just
super advanced. So you definitely want to have a strong command of mathematics before you can
become a wizard. So that's level four, a mathematical wizard. Hopefully after watching this video,
you can become better at mathematics. And I'm really curious, what level are you at? Do you
feel like you're at level one, level two, level three, or level four? Let me know in the comments
below. Good luck and become a mathematical wizard.
