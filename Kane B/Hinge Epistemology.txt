Hello YouTube! In this video I'm going to outline hinge epistemology, an approach
to knowledge and justification that has its roots in Wittgenstein's book On
Certainty. Now I want to be clear from the outset that the goal of this video is
not to explain Wittgenstein's own views, which are very much open to
interpretation, rather we're going to look at how hinge epistemology has been
developed in contemporary epistemology. I'm going to focus in particular on the
work of Duncan Pritchard. Okay, so first of all we need to consider
skepticism. Hinge epistemology is often sort of initially developed at least as
a response to skepticism. The skeptic aims to call into question all of our
beliefs, or at least a very large class of our beliefs. So here's a classic
argument for skepticism. If I don't know that not S, I don't know that P, I don't
know that not S, so I don't know that P, where S is a skeptical hypothesis, like
the hypothesis that I'm a brain in a vat, or that I'm dreaming, or that I'm a
Boltzmann brain. You can see my previous video for a discussion of Boltzmann
brains. P is a claim about the external world, like I have hands, right? If I
don't know that I'm not a brain in a vat, I don't know that I have hands. I don't
know I'm not a brain in a vat, so I don't know I have hands. In general I don't
know whether there are any external objects at all. If this argument is
successful it throws doubt on basically all our common-sense beliefs about the
external world. Now it was noticed by philosophers like GE Moore that there is
something a bit odd about this kind of argument. Moore responded that surely a
proposition like I know I have hands is is more certain, more secure than almost
any other proposition. There's nothing that could be more obvious than that I
know I have hands. So Moore argued that no philosophical argument, which you know
I mean a philosophical argument will inevitably appeal to premises less
certain than the premise I know I have hands, no argument like that should lead
me to reject the claim that I have hands. Moore famously responded to this by
simply holding up his hands saying you know here's one hand here's another so
there are two external objects so the external world exists. You know you just
sort of flip the argument around. Right here's one hand here's another so
clearly I'm not a brain in a vat. Again I have a whole video discussing Moore's
argument that I'll link in the comments. So it was this sort of Mauryan kind of
response that prompted Wittgenstein's initial reflections on certainty.
Wittgenstein agreed with Moore that a proposition like I have hands is held
with a kind of certainty. Even so Wittgenstein felt that there was something
odd about asserting the proposition I know that I have hands and the key the
key problem here is that in ordinary circumstances claims that we have
knowledge or indeed that we fail to have knowledge makes sense only where
there might be genuine doubt about what we claim to know or where we can offer
some sort of justification for what we claim to know. Like if I say I know that
P it's perfectly legitimate to then ask me well how do you know that P what
reasons can you cite to justify P but in ordinary circumstances these sorts of
questions about you know doubts and reasons and justification they just
don't arise when it comes to a claim like I have hands. I mean you know what
what sort of possible justification could be given for the claim that I have
hands. Well I mean when Moore responded to the skeptic he simply held up his
hands and said here are two hands. So you know Moore must be assuming that he
can justify the claim that he has hands by perceiving his hands and I mean you
know you might think okay yeah well surely you know like if you if you ask
for a justification for the claim that I have hands then well I know that I have
hands via perception right I perceive that I have hands maybe that's the
justification but Wittgenstein says there this isn't gonna work because well as he
says I quote if a blind man were to ask me have you got two hands I should not
make sure by looking if I were to have any doubt of it then I don't know why I
should trust my eyes for why shouldn't I test my eyes by looking to find out
whether I had whether I see my two hands what is to be tested by what. So
basically if I were to have like genuine doubt about whether or not I have two
hands then I wouldn't be able to rely on my visual impressions to test this
because you know if I'm doubting if I'm calling into question the existence of
my hands if I'm calling into question something as obvious as that then I'm
also probably you know I should also be calling into question the testimony of
my eyes you know I'm gonna I'm gonna call into question the testimony of
anything else like the claim that I have hands is sort of I'm just as certain of
that as I am of the claim that my eyes are reliable so you know why why shouldn't
I instead doubt my eyes and then check that my eyes are working by looking to
see whether I have two hands I mean this is actually something that we will
sometimes do in circumstances where you know our vision is impaired like if I'm
in a fog or something I might actually like hold my hands out in front of me
and look and find if I can see them you know like I and then and then I'm like
oh my goodness you know this is a really thick fog because I don't see my hands
there so you know we the point is is that like the testimony of my if if we're
calling into question the test whether or not I have hands I'm gonna be calling
into question whether or not my eyes are trustworthy so I can't test whether or
not I have hands by by like looking to see whether or not my hands are there
that at least that's not a genuine justification yeah so there's no way to
test this proposition I have hands so questions of doubt can't really arise I
mean there are situations of course where genuine doubt can arise so if for
example I have been in a serious car accident I wake up in a hospital
afterwards I find that my arms are bandaged I can't see my hands in that
situation I might genuinely doubt whether I have hands and since you know I trust
my visual perception I can remove the bandages to confirm whether there are
hands there and this is of course a procedure that I can perform that
resolves my doubt in that situation but for the radical skeptic there is no
procedure that could resolve her doubt there is nothing I can do there's
nothing I can perceive that would resolve the doubt about whether or not I have
hands which for Wittgenstein means that that's not a genuine doubt at all
I mean what like what would it be you know what would it be to genuinely doubt
whether I have hands well maybe it would be that like I wouldn't flinch if I
were to see a knife coming towards my hands of course the this the external
world skeptic doesn't give up these ordinary behaviors if you if you start
to try to stab her hands she's gonna move her hands and if somebody really
didn't flinch when they saw a knife coming towards their hands no doubt their
behavior would quickly be corrected right the knife would hit their hands
they'd feel pain and they'd they'd start behaving accordingly okay so with that
in mind then let's say let's say that in ordinary circumstances I was to claim
I know I have hands well what possible justification could be given for this I
mean I mean nothing right I can't say well I can't justify that claim by
saying that I see my hands because if I'm doubting whether I have hands then
I'm not gonna trust my eyes so you know I can't appeal to the testimony of my eyes
in the same goes for any other perceptual capacity there's no there's no
justification available here so you know there's no there's no justification
there's no that it seems that there's no there's no real possibility of doubt like
for knowledge to be possible there must be the there must be the space for for
doubt and justification like when I when I say I know that P this is sort of
presupposing the possibility that there are like circumstances where I don't
know that P or like maybe I don't know the P right and and what I'm doing is
giving a justification for P knowledge is based on evidential grounds like when
I claim to know something I must be able to cite evidence for it and that
evidence you know might be undermined in which case my claim to knowledge would
be undermined so you know in ordinary circumstances the idea would be that
knowledge claims are appropriate when we have you know arrived at some claim
through investigation when we can when we can ask questions like how do you know
but but when it comes to a claim like I have hands this sort of doubt and
citing of evidence and investigation this just isn't part of it right I don't
investigate whether or not I have hands I just do things with my hands so the
idea is that I have hands has this sort of special status it's a proposition with
a very special status or claim with a very special status it's a a hinge
commitment or a hinge proposition at Wittgenstein calls these commitments
hinges because they are the presuppositions around which the rest of
our language and epistemic practices turn the the thought is that there are
certain commitments that just have to be assumed in order for various practices
to be possible just like the hinges of a door must stay in place in order for the
door to step to stay up and to open and close like in order for the door to turn
the hinges have to stay in place hinge commitments are required for practices
for various practices to be possible in particular hinge commitments are
required in order for the practice of rational evaluation to be possible so
like rational evaluation would be like doubt justification giving evidence in
order for that practice to occur there have to be certain commitments that are
in place that make it possible but this means that those commitments cannot
themselves be subject to this rational evaluation they cannot themselves be
called into doubt so so like rational evaluation involves doubt okay I asked
myself could this proposition be false right like I I believe that all you know
the all species share a common ancestor okay but you know why do I believe that
could that be false okay then I then I start to engage in a rational
evaluation I search for reasons to accept or reject the proposition hinges
must be exempt from this sort of doubt because the very act of raising doubts
and performing investigations is itself predicated upon these hinges so since
hinge commitments are outside of rational evaluation they do not themselves have
any rational support so we saw this in the case of I have hands in ordinary
circumstances it wouldn't make sense to try to offer a justification for this
claim so hinge commitments are neither justified nor unjustified they are
neither known nor unknown right so so they're not justified they're not known
so actually when I say something like I know I have hands that would be again
in ordinary circumstances at least that would be kind of you know sort of a
misuse a misuse of language right it would be the mistake is is that no this
just isn't it doesn't have a kind of this sort of epistemic status for the
very same reason they can't be doubted if I was to ask a question like what
reason is there to believe a hinge commitment that would be a mistake
because hinge commitments are what enable the giving of reasons yeah I mean
so if I were to doubt whether I have hands that would just call into question
the whole practice of making claims or doubting claims like even even to doubt
requires a background of assumptions such as I have hands and of course this
accounts for the special kind of certainty that is associated with hinge
commitments hinge commitments cannot be doubted but at the same time we can't
offer a compelling argument for them the certainty of hinge commitments is not
based on our being able to offer a proof for them it's based on the fact that
these are the presuppositions that make inquiry possible or indeed that make our
general form of life possible our general practice as possible okay so let's
sort of see this maybe with another example so consider these two claims so
we have a claim like there is milk in the fridge and then we have a claim like
there are external objects now in the case of there is milk in the fridge
there are very straightforward empirical procedures for establishing this
establishing claim M here I know what to do to test it one way or the other
okay I go to the fridge I open the door I search for a bottle of a particular
size and shape and if I find such a bottle I'm going to take it that M is
true I'll be like okay I've established that there is milk in the fridge now
obviously further questions could be raised here like how do I know that the
bottle really contains milk how do I know that you know my brother isn't pulling
some sort of prank and he's replaced the milk with something else but again
there are straightforward procedures for answering such questions if I am really
questioning whether or not my brother has pulled this prank I can you know pour
the milk pour the liquid out of the bottle and then I can taste it and so on
so again you know straightforward empirical procedures for testing this
claim M what about claim E that there are external objects well clearly this
cannot be approached in the same kind of way no observation could establish E
it won't help to take you know a microscope and look through it it's I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna have a microscope and be like okay I've looked
through the microscope and there it is an external object the difference of
course is that in accepting that there are external objects I'm I'm not
accepting a straightforward empirical claim I'm instead I'm accepting a sort of
way of inquiring I'm you know this is the sort of claim that allows me to
gather evidence for and against other propositions and so this is what the
this is a hinge commitment right it's hinge commitments are what allows to
gather evidence for and against other propositions so I might say something
like you know there are three chairs in this room or I might say that the
universe is 13.8 billion years old I can assess evidence for these claims
crucially however this evidence like this this evidence that presupposes that
there are external objects and it it can't the evidence can't provide support
to the hinge commitment because the hinge commitment is what is making
possible the gathering of evidence in the first place so any any justification
given of a hinge commitment would be less firm than the hinge commitment
itself so like I can cite evidence for the claim that the universe has existed
for 13.8 billion years now given that I am significantly younger than 13.8
billion years this is going to entail that there are external objects there
are objects outside my mind objects other than me so you entails E but you
cannot be evidence for E and and evidence for you cannot be evidence for E
because the evidence that bears on you presupposes E all the evidence in
favor of you from physics and chemistry and astronomy and geology would make no
sense without E like we can only bring claims about so if I take the you know
redshifting of starlight or something like that well that's only gonna bear on
the evaluation of you if we're assuming E if I'm assuming that you know there
isn't that there are these external objects and I'm not just you know
currently dreaming or whatever so that's the idea of hinge commitments so
which propositions which propositions count as the hinge commitments well
different hinge epistemologists are gonna have different answers to this but
you know there are some some some general answers we can give here so that
some types of some hinge commitments are going to include sort of specific
propositions about myself and my own experience propositions that express the
sort of basic pieces of evidence I have from my own experience like I have hands
my name is Kane I am speaking English I have never been to the moon then there
are gonna be more general claims bearing on my sort of general worldview and how
I've formed beliefs so there is an external world sense perception is
reliable reasoning is reliable the universe is older than I am and so on
right where well okay if you like my channel you can support me on patreon
where I upload bonus videos where I offer my own thoughts about the topics I
talk about on the on these on these videos or a one-off donation on PayPal I
also offer private tutoring so email if you're interested in that private
tutoring in philosophy and I have a discord link store this will be in the
description right then so we've seen the role that hinge commitments play in
inquiry but what exactly is the nature of these hinge commitments well a
standard interpretation is that hinge commitments are something like rules
they're not exactly you know they have the form of descriptive propositions but
really they're more like rules so as Wittgenstein says their role is like
that of rules of a game and the game can be learned purely practically without
learning any explicit rules see a hinge commitment is going to appear to be a
descriptive claim like if I say I have hands that has the appearance of merely
describing the arrangement of objects in the world it's like okay there is this
thing a hand which is attached to this person so descriptive claim but really
what's happening when we say something like I have hands is we are we sort of
stating conditions that must be in place in order for certain practices to occur
or we're stating the rules of certain practices and so under normal
circumstances I wouldn't explicitly say something like I have hands in
philosophical contexts we use this seemingly descriptive claim to express
certain rules that govern our practices and these rules are manifested in our
actions so when I was writing the script for this video I was typing on my
computer and to do this I had to have hands I use my hands to type on the
computer and maybe I find that a letter doesn't come up and then I wonder like
does this key still work I try it again I tap it with my hands right I'm using
my hands so my behavior with respect to the computer is governed by certain
rules and I need not be explicitly aware of these rules like I don't have to
consciously think to myself that I have hands in order to use my hands right
often I'll just use my hands I won't I won't sort of have some proposition in
my head that says I have hands I'll just use my hands indeed this rule is not
something that even has to be taught at least not in the way that I was taught
say the theory of evolution by natural selection like I'm not taught the
proposition that I have hands I'm taught how to use my hands to do various
things and in being taught these practices I adopt these rules these hinge
commitments Daniel Moyle-Sharick put it like this the hinge certainty verbalized
as I have a body is a disposition of a living creature which manifests itself
in her acting in the certainty of having a body so the certainty is of these
rules it's certainly these rules these commitments is manifested in her actions
the fact that I'm acting just shows that I accept these rules that I'm
conforming to these rules and this is why even when I recognize that there is no
rational basis for the truth of the proposition I have hands like even when
I recognize that I have no reasons for this as a belief my certainty in it is
unchanged it will continue to function as a rule that guides my behavior I can
notice that there's no rational basis for the belief that I have hands and then I
sit down and start typing things on my computer right so this approach gives
voice to the worry that skepticism as the philosopher conceives of it is in
some way inert or meaningless so as we noted earlier there are circumstances
where I will experience genuine doubt about whether or not I have hands as
when I wake up in a hospital bed after a car crash I can resolve such doubts by
applying certain standard empirical procedures that I've learned like you
know looking under the bandages and then I see I see the hands there and I'm
like oh I might say in relief oh I know I have two hands thank God you know this
isn't the kind of thing the skeptic is talking about of course the skeptic
tries to ask for a rational justification of our whole world view and tries to cast
doubt on whether I have hands even in ordinary contexts but the skeptics doubt
it's a doubt that makes no difference whatsoever the skeptic doesn't change
her actions she continues to use her hands just as the rest of us do and the
skeptic doesn't propose any procedure for resolving the doubt indeed by her
lights there can be no procedure for resolving the doubt because the the
skeptical hypotheses are designed to be consistent with all possible experience
so yeah so it's not it's not really a doubt at all I mean I can ponder these
skeptical arguments all I like but at the end of the day I still know how to use
a keyboard and it's this knowing how to use a keyboard that manifests the hinge
commitment that I have hands so that is the basic idea of hinge epistemology
now there are three immediate challenges to this kind of approach so the first
the first challenge is whether this sort of view actually provides a response to
skepticism we've talked about skepticism a lot and contrasted the hinge the hinge
epistemologist with the skeptic but we might worry whether whether the
difference is as great as it seems to be so notice that the hinge epistemologist
identifies certain commitments as being the hinge commitments and there are two
relevant features of hinge commitments as the hinge epistemologist sees it first
they are the presuppositions on which the rest of our inquiries are built they're
the you know the hinges on which the rest of our practice has turned second
they are not justified they are not known no reason can be given in support
of them no justification can be given for them but then you might think well hang
on a minute isn't this exactly what a skeptic would say like all of our
beliefs rest on these presuppositions that cannot be justified so all of our
beliefs are ultimately unsupported now of course a hinge epistemologist will
reject this final inference right all of our beliefs rest on propositions that
cannot be justified sure it does not follow that all of our beliefs are
unsupported we have to pay attention to what it means to give support to a
belief this is a matter of giving reasons of engaging in investigation of
assuaging doubts but this activity presupposes certain hinge commitments the
trouble is is that even a skeptic might be willing to accept what we could call
you know conditional justification or conditional support so the skeptic might
accept that look if you take certain propositions for granted say the
proposition that perception presents a generally reliable picture of the
external world if I take that for granted then I can give support to further
propositions on that basis like if we take P for granted we can get ourselves to
Q the issue for the skeptic is that there's no justification for P but then
I mean but then like where exactly is the line between the hinge epistemology
and the skeptic here is it just that they have like different attitudes to
these presuppositions so like both of them seem to agree that okay there are
certain presuppositions that you can make which like there are certain
presuppositions we make which you know which then allows us to engage in
further inquiry you know which then makes possible all of these other
practices or which you know like if we take these presuppositions for granted
then you know this practice of justification is possible so okay
looks like we both agree on that and moreover they both agree that these
presuppositions are themselves without justification is it just that the
hinge epistemologist is okay with this whereas the skeptic is not okay with it
like it's just a difference in attitude so this is one sort of worry that like
okay maybe the line is starting to look quite thin we'll come back to this
point later so second challenge is that hinge epistemology appears to be
committed to epistemic relativism basic problem here is well it looks like
people could have could adopt very different hinge commitments which would
lead to different systems of justification suppose that Verity selects as a
hinge commitment that the Bible is the infallible world of word of God Verity
is fervently religious she interprets all other practices in terms of her
literal Christian faith her literalist faith as a result she endorses young
earth creationism as an account of the history of life now since the Bible is a
hinge commitment for Verity it's not open to doubt or justification in which
case it looks like there's no room for debate with Verity Verity is not making
any kind of rational error you know all I can say is well we have different
hinge commitments and our hinge commitments are immovable so I mean
there's a worry that like hinge hinge epistemology seems to sort of close down
rational inquiry and there's also a worry that it sort of licenses a kind of
just dogmatism you know like we just end up accepting certain things and
and they're kind of quarantined from from criticism and justification and of
course this this only makes this this specter of skepticism more vivid
because you know we can recognize that Verity's hinge commitments have led her
to a radically mistaken view of the world so we're like okay these hinge
commitments have led somebody massively astray in which case we might wonder
well why shouldn't that be the same for our own hinge commitments then I mean
just insisting that hinge commitments can't be open to doubt is not a
particularly comforting response here you know that it's like there seems to be
something defective about the way that Verity the creationist justifies her
worldview if I recognize that the only difference between us is that we happen
to have different hinge commitments I mean maybe my worldview is defective
also you know this is the worry a third problem is that it seems that hinge
commitments can change over time and in response to new evidence so I have hands
is currently a hinge commitment but we've already seen that there are
circumstances where I might genuinely come to doubt this what is it that makes
me doubt this well it looks like it's the changing evidence so you know or think
about a statement like no human being has ever walked on the moon that was a
hinge commitment prior to the 1960s these days we think it's simply false now
the trouble here is that it looks like what's happening is that these hinge
commitments are changing as a result of rational evaluation so when I wake up in
the hospital bed with my arms bandaged and I can't feel my hands in this
situation it's perfectly rational for me to doubt whether I still have hands but
it's like okay so I've received evidence which has now cast doubt on whether I
have hands but but hinge commitments are supposed to be exempt from doubt exempt
from rational justification so how is it possible for hinge commitments to change
in this manner you know that like giving up the belief that I have hands in that
situation looks like an almost paradigmatic example of change due to
rational evaluation so how does the hinge epistemologist account for this sort of
case well Duncan Pritchard has proposed an approach to hinge epistemology that
he argues solves many of these problems Pritchard suggests that all hinge
commitments follow from a commitment to what he calls the uber hinge commitment
the uber hinge commitment is the proposition I am not radically and
fundamentally in error this is the single basic hinge commitment which all
people must share other hinge commitments are merely expressions of this more
general uber hinge commitment they are how the uber hinge commitment manifests
in particular contexts suppose for example that it would you know suppose
it would somehow true that I don't have hands right now as I'm typing the script
for this on the computer in that case I would have to be radically and
fundamentally in error something would have gone deeply wrong with my belief
forming processes but you know I take it for granted that I'm not radically and
fundamentally in error I have to take this for granted in order to sensibly
investigate anything there would be no point undertaking an investigation if I
could not trust my capacities to investigate but I can only trust my
capacities to investigate if I take it that I'm not radically and fundamentally
in error so this uber hinge commitment grounds the rest of my inquiries the
the uber hinge commitment is universal but of course different circumstances in
conjunction with the uber hinge commitment will lead us to form more
specific hinge commitments my present circumstances lead to the hinge
commitment I have hands but if I were to wake up in the hospital bed my
circumstances would be different so the uber hinge commitment would require
different things of me so this neatly deals with the problem that hinge
commitments seem to change over time right the the uber hinge commitment
remains in place so like right now I have hands that's not open to genuine
doubt because to deny that I have hands I'd have to take myself to be radically
and fundamentally in error contrary to the uber hinge but this need this need
not be the case in all possible circumstances right there are
circumstances where I have hands could be genuinely doubted but with the uber
hinge still in place what what cannot like what fundamentally cannot be
doubted is the the uber hinge Pritchard argues that this understanding of
epistemology hinge epistemology allows us to address the challenge of
relativism so the key point is that not just anything can count as a hinge
commitment you know in particular merely having the attitude of certainty to a
proposition does not make it a hinge commitment our hinge commitments are
only those claims that manifest the uber hinge commitment so I mean in a sense
this will still involve a kind of relativism because there's the universal
uber hinge commitment and then other hinge commitments will be relative to
different circumstances but crucially this does not entail that you know
disagreements are going to be rationally irresolvable so take a case where two
people are debating the same topic so I'm debating whether creationism ought
to be taught in schools as an alternative to the modern evolutionary
synthesis the creationist can say that she is certain of the Bible even so I
mean that's not going to be a hinge commitment so both myself and the
creationist clearly share various practices these are going to be everyday
behaviors like eating food driving cars and so on I mean we're both concerned
with the education system of the same country so we share a society we share
various practices within that society so we must have a great deal of common
ground and of course we both share the uber hinge commitment we both take it
I am not radically and fundamentally in error but in that case we should expect
substantial overlap in our beliefs in our beliefs about how the external world
works in our common sense beliefs about what we observe on a day-to-day basis so
yeah the creationist can claim to be certain that the Bible is the infallible
world of God word of God but mere certainty does not make something a
hinge commitment because like even so like suppose the Bible turned out not to
be the word of God would this mean that the creationist is radically and
fundamentally in error well no because the vast majority of her beliefs and
practices don't actually have anything to do with the Bible when the creationist
gets into a car and drives to the grocery store her picture of the world is
only tangentially related to the Bible if related at all so that the real sort
of challenge of relativism is the idea that there can be disagreements that
cannot be rationally resolved if if you accept relativism you have to grant that
people with fundamentally different world views might be equally rational and
that there's nothing that we can say to them that would compel them at least
rationally compel them to change their minds but on Pritchard's view everybody
shares the same fundamental hinge commitment and everybody shares a
variety of practices which gives us significant common ground so there's no
reason to expect that I would be unable to present evidence to the creationist
that would in fact connect with the creationist's worldview and that would
rationally compel the creationist to agree with me. Appealing to the Uber
hinge commitment can also so appealing to the over hinge commitment can resolve
the problem of changing hinges and the problem of relativism what about
skepticism this this big challenge well here we run into the problem that the
Uber hinge commitment is itself held without justification so the hinge
epistemologist is going to need some other way to you know distinguish her
view from the from the skeptic so as as Pritchard sees it skepticism assumes what
he calls the universality of rational evaluation basically the skeptic
assumes that there are universal rational evaluations where all of one's beliefs
are rationally evaluated all at once what the skeptic tries to do is step
outside of all inquiries suspend all presuppositions and give a general
rational evaluation of all of them bringing them all into doubt when the
skeptic says that a particular claim is not justified this is a kind of rational
evaluation. So the skeptical argument like it rests on the claim that you know
if I don't know that I'm not a brain in a vat I don't know that P where you know
the argument asks us to consider the basis of any beliefs about the world
whether they be everyday beliefs or scientific beliefs or religious beliefs
or anything else you know can can the basis of our beliefs exclude skeptical
scenarios like the brain in the vat scenario it thereby seeks a universal
rational evaluation of those beliefs by contrast the hinge epistemologist
proposes that hinge commitments are exempt from rational evaluation in
particular the the Uber hinge that Uber hinge commitment is non-optional it's
non-optional because again as we saw in order for me to perform a rational
evaluation I must trust my rational capacities so I must assume that I'm
not radically in error so it's perfectly legitimate to doubt particular
beliefs in particular context where the skeptic goes wrong is that she tries to
generalize this she tries to doubt beliefs across the board but why suppose
that this is legitimate I mean that's a substantive theoretical assumption that
the hinge epistemologist denies so as Pritchard puts it I quote the locality
of our everyday rational evaluations is not an incidental feature of these
practices as if we were merely lacking in time or imagination but rather
essential to what it is to undertake a rational evaluation okay so the skeptic
and the hinge epistemologist agree that our hinge commitments are groundless
where they disagree is that the skeptic takes it that we can genuinely doubt
such commitments and we can we can perform this rational evaluation of them
for the hinge epistemologist the groundlessness of such commitments is
precisely what shields them from rational evaluation I mean in a sense we
can so there are two ways that a belief can fail to have justification it might
have no justification because it is unjustified where you know that's a
negative rational evaluation it might have no justification because it just has
no status as either justified or unjustified and that's what the hinge
epistemologist will say of our hinge commitments so is that convincing well
here's just one worry although there are arguments for radical skepticism that
target beliefs across the board like a gripper's trilemma say not all
skeptical arguments are intended to be global this is the case for the skeptical
argument that we encountered earlier in this video which aims to establish
external world skepticism it's not actually obvious in what sense this
argument involves a universal rational evaluation because this argument is only
targeting a specific subset of our beliefs many beliefs such as beliefs
about logic about mathematics about my own mind beliefs about you know our
trust in methods of inductive inference and so on are not actually
threatened by scenarios like the brain in the bat scenario at least not
obviously so so we might object that really this is just another kind of
local evaluation like the the external world skeptic does not have to doubt the
uber hinge commitment so I can think that my rational capacities are perfectly
reliable that you know I have a good understanding of deductive and inductive
inference that I can reliably introspect my own mental states it's just well
turns out that the external world is not as it seems to be so it's not I don't
know it's not obvious that that would involve a doubt of the uber hinge
commitment right like maybe we might think that yeah I can have I can have
sort of better reasons so you know you know perception is is not perfectly
reliable obviously right everybody accepts that on the other hand there are
many many other capacities beyond perception that I use for falling
beliefs and maybe those other capacities can cast greater doubt on
perception right why not that seems to be what's going on in the the argument
for external world skepticism now obviously you know a Wittgensteinian
would object to this solipsistic sort of picture but there's the question is
whether there's anything in hinge epistemology in itself that rules this
out and certainly if the issue with skepticism is universal is that it
tries to perform a universal rational evaluation it's not clear that that's
going to work as an objection to to external world skepticism all right
then well that was hinge epistemology so I'm gonna leave the video there I hope
you found that interesting and I will see you next time right goodbye
