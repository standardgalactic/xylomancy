Hello YouTube! In this video I'm going to outline Quine's criticism of the analytic synthetic
distinction. This is one of the central distinctions in philosophy and the basic idea of this distinction
can be stated quite easily. So there are two kinds of propositions. Analytic propositions
are propositions that are true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone. So examples
include all bachelors are unmarried, if it's raining then it's raining, two plus two equals four,
triangles have five sides. Then synthetic propositions are propositions that are true or false
partly in virtue of meaning and also partly in virtue of the way the world is. So Frank
Zappel is a musician, smoking causes cancer, the sky is green, all philosophers are poor and so on.
So you know it's true that smoking causes cancer. Now this is true partly in virtue of the meanings
of the terms. If the word smoking had referred to running instead then smoking causes cancer would
have been false but its truth is also dependent on the facts in the world right. So nothing about
like the word smoking in itself entails that it causes cancer we might have discovered that smoking
prevented cancer. I mean indeed it was once thought that smoking had health benefits right.
So you know the world could have turned out that way but it didn't. The point is what makes this
sentence true is something about the way the world is. By contrast take a statement like
all bachelors are unmarried. Well what makes this true is just the meanings of the terms.
Part of what it is to be a bachelor is to be unmarried. So there's no scenario that could
render this false no matter what happens, no matter what way the world turns out to be,
this could not be false. If you think you can conceive of a bachelor who is married you just
fail to understand the words. So this is the basic distinction right. Some propositions are true
because of what the world is like. Some propositions are true just because of the meanings of the
terms involved and similarly for false propositions. Now this distinction is important because it has
been applied to many other sort of topics and problems within philosophy. So many philosophers
have thought that if we have some notion of analytic truths, if we have this notion of
analyticity then we can make sense of a priori knowledge, that is truths that are known
independently of experience. So we don't need to investigate the world to discover that all
bachelors are unmarried. We can know that all bachelors are unmarried just by understanding
the terms in the sentence. Provided we understand the words there can be no doubters to its truth.
So like analytic truths can be known independent of experience. For the same reason analytic
truths are necessary. They could not have been false. They are true in all possible worlds
to use the modern parlance. Now this permits a neat account of the truths of logic and mathematics.
Logic and mathematics appear to be a priori disciplines. They don't depend on empirical
investigation. When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem he didn't proceed by deriving
predictions from the theorem and then performing experiments. That's not generally how mathematics
works. Instead you work out the consequences of various axioms. The truths of logic and
mathematics are also necessary. There's no possible world in which Fermat's last theorem is false.
And there's something of a puzzle about how these non-empirical disciplines work. There's
something kind of strange about the idea that well there is something that calls for explanation
in that you know it seems like there are truths that we can know but where they're not in any way
you know we don't know them by performing experiments and they seem to be necessarily
true. There's a puzzle. What kind of truths are these? And if the truths of logic and mathematics
are analytic well okay we at least have the beginnings of a solution to this puzzle. It's
like okay we're working out what follows from what in virtue of meaning. The analytic synthetic
distinction also lays the ground for a substantive role for philosophy. For much of the 20th century
it was thought that the basic method of philosophy was conceptual analysis where this involves trying
to specify the necessary insufficient conditions for the application of a concept. So take the
concept bachelor for instance we might sort of break that down into the concept of like
not being married and the concept of man. So all unmarried men are bachelors and only unmarried
men are bachelors. A bachelor is an unmarried man and the point is is that being an unmarried man is
necessary insufficient for being a bachelor. Now bachelor of course is not a particularly
interesting concept in itself but think about a concept like knowledge. Much of the literature
on knowledge involves conceptual analysis of knowledge. Traditionally it was held that knowledge
is justified true belief. So we'd say that s knows that p just in case p is true, s believes that p
and s has believed that p is justified. But this is famously challenged by Gettier cases. Cases in
which a person has justified true belief but does not have knowledge. So think about a case
where somebody you know wakes up in the morning they go downstairs they look at the clock it says
eight o'clock and it is in fact eight o'clock. So it looks like they have a justified true belief
that it's eight o'clock but now imagine that the clock had stopped at eight o'clock the night before.
Well do they know that it's eight o'clock? Arguably not. So we have justified true belief
without knowledge. Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge. So knowledge is not
justified true belief. And then of course other epistemologists will try to propose other analyses
of knowledge that get around these sorts of cases. So essentially conceptual analysis of some
concept involves proposing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of
the concept and then testing that against our intuitions about various cases. You know we look
for cases where the proposed conditions are satisfied but where the concept would not be
applied or cases where we would apply the concept but where the conditions are not satisfied.
There's a lot of philosophy that works in this sort of mould. And of course you know one very
straightforward way to account what's going on here is to say well philosophers are investigating
the analytic truths right. They're trying to work out what's true in virtue of meaning.
Now I mean look what I've just said here is all it's very brief and there are many
objections we might have to this way of characterising things. Still I think that it's reasonably
intuitive that there's a gap between the conceptual parts of inquiry which proceed by investigating
meaning and working out what follows from what and the empirical parts of inquiry which requires
to perform experiments and make observations of the world. There seems to be to be a difference here
and the analytic synthetic distinction kind of can underlie this gap between the different
areas of inquiry right. So when we're sort of doing the conceptual stuff we're dealing with
analytic truths and when we're doing the empirical stuff we're investigating the synthetic truths.
So yeah philosophers have tried to use analyticity to explain notions like
a priori knowledge and necessary truths and maybe even you know try to create
a role for philosophy as a sort of autonomous discipline. So this is a very nice picture.
It's a nice picture very very influential but a critique of this was presented by
W. V. O. Quine in his paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism. Now Two Dogmas of Empiricism was written
primarily in response to logical positivism which is a bit outside the scope of this particular
video but the arguments that were given by Quine have obviously been influential
beyond this. So Quine argues that there is no analytic synthetic distinction. There are no
statements that are true purely in virtue of meaning and of course this is something to follow
well you know nothing can be known a priori. All statements must in one way or the other be
tested against experience as Quine sees it there's no way to isolate some set of substantive
truths that are not vulnerable to empirical disconfirmation. So in the rest of this video
we're going to we're going to outline Quine's arguments. All right then so our question is
what exactly is analyticity? So I gave a brief sort of intuitive characterization of the
analytic synthetic distinction when I began this video but you know we want to define it
precisely like what exactly is analyticity? What is it for a statement to be analytic?
Well the obvious place to begin is by looking at how past philosophers have understood analyticity.
Quine says he attributes to Kant the following view that analytic statements are those
are those which attribute to the subject no more than is already conceptually contained
in the subject concept. So if I say bachelors are unmarried the predicate concept unmarried
is already contained within the subject concept bachelor. So anything that's a bachelor must
be unmarried because when I apply this concept bachelor that just is to apply the concept unmarried
like one of the things I'm doing when I call something a bachelor is I'm calling it unmarried
because like being unmarried is just contained within the concept of bachelor.
Well okay this sounds nice there are a couple of drawbacks to this. First of all this is only
going to apply to subject predicate sentences. It's not obvious how to extend this characterization
of analyticity to other sentences like if it's raining then water is pouring from the sky.
More seriously the notion of conceptual containment is not really any better understood than the
notion of analyticity. This notion of one concept containing another that's just a metaphor.
I mean a concept isn't literally a box into which other concepts might be put. So Quine says well
you know this doesn't really get us as much further in terms of having a clear characterization
of analyticity. Okay so another attempt then is to say that a statement is analytic just in case
it's denial results in a contradiction. So if I can so if you take the sentence like
bachelors are unmarried the idea is going to be that if I deny this if I claim that some bachelors
are married then I have contradicted myself. Okay what's the problem with this? So Alex Miller
in his introduction to philosophy of language suggests that we can kind of distinguish between
two senses of contradiction. First of all there's a purely syntactic notion of contradiction.
In this case a statement is self-contradictory only if it has the syntactic form p and not p.
So if I say Frank is a bachelor and it is not the case that Frank is a bachelor that would be an
example of a syntactic contradiction. Now this notion is perfectly well understood we have no
problem formalizing statements and identifying logical contradictions in this sense. The trouble
is that in many cases denying an analytic truth is not going to take this form. So if I claim that
Frank is a married bachelor I realize that I'm looking at my slides here and I've messed up
because that should say second there is a broader sense of contradiction which includes statements
such as Frank is a married bachelor. So just flip that in your head. So Frank is a married bachelor
this is supposed to be an example of the second sort of contradiction. If I claim that Frank is a
married bachelor that statement does not have the syntactic form p and not p. So if this is a
contradiction we must be assuming some broader notion of contradiction this isn't just a purely
syntactic contradiction. So corresponding to these two notions of contradiction Quine distinguishes
two classes of analytic statement. So analytic statements of the first class are logical truths
and we identify these purely in virtue of their syntactic form. What makes these statements true
are the arrangement of their purely logical terms. So these are terms like all some not and if then
etc these are the sorts of you know the terms that we would use when describing the logical operators
basically. When we're dealing with logical truths we can give any interpretation we like of the
non-logical terms. So I say all unmarried men are unmarried and then we can sort of put this in
slightly more formal notation as you know for all x if ux then ux. It doesn't matter how
you interpret the terms unmarried and men here you can you can have any interpretation of those
that you like this is going to come out as being true. This is true just as a matter of logic.
Quine accepts this notion but then there are analytic statements of the second class
and these are more problematic. So when I say all bachelors are unmarried or all vixens are female
foxes well these are not true in virtue of syntactic form alone these are not true in
virtue of their just sort of like surface logical form. So what exactly is it that makes them true?
Now notice of course that it's going to be analytic statements of the second class that
are of interest to philosophers when we you know propose a conceptual analysis for instance
such as that knowledge is justified through belief that's an analytic statement of the
second class it's not just a trivial truth of logical form. So the question is how do we make
sense of analytic statements of the second class? Well initial idea that Quine considers is to appeal
to synonymy. So here's the idea we can say that that an analytic truth p is an analytic truth
just in case either one p is a logical truth or two p can be transformed into a logical truth
by substituting synonymous terms. So this is going to be if it's a logical truth it's an
analytic statement of the first class if it can be transformed into a logical truth by
substituting synonymous terms it's an analytic statement of the second class.
So basically via synonymy we can we can transform analytic statements of the second class into
analytic statements of the first class. Let's say I take all female foxes are vixens the idea is
that the word vixen is synonymous with female fox so we can replace female fox in that initial
sentence to get all vixens are vixens which is just a straightforward logical truth
and that's going to remain true no matter how you interpret the statement vixen right no matter
what vixens refers to that's going to be true so there we have it. Similarly if you take all
bachelors are unmarried by substituting synonyms for synonyms we get all unmarried men are unmarried
a logical truth we can we can make all bachelors are unmarried into a logical truth by substituting
synonyms for synonyms but now what exactly is it for two terms to be synonymous what is synonymy
I mean clearly you know when we have two synonymous terms they're not exactly the same right so
we're not dealing with a sort of complete identity of all of the things that we might call meaning
such as as quine says psychological associations or poetic quality in that sense vixen and female
fox are clearly not synonymous you know they they're not exactly identical in terms of like
poetic quality so okay what the hell is synonymy then well it seems simple enough
two terms are synonymous just in case those terms have the same definition so now we're
appealing to the idea that there is a correct definition of terms right if we say that two
terms have the same definition and we can say that they're synonymous and then we can use that to
ground this notion of analyticity now quine does grant that in one context this idea of
correct definition is perfectly acceptable and this is where we give stipulative definitions
so suppose that I introduce the abbreviation ff and I just stipulate that ff abbreviates
female fox well I mean this doesn't you know I'm not I'm not appealing to any prior notion of
analyticity or synonymy or sameness of meaning or anything like that I'm just stipulating an
abbreviation I I'm saying like okay I'm gonna adopt a convention that any use of the words
female fox can be substituted for ff I mean just imagine like you know you're sort of I don't know
writing down a speech or something like that and then as you're writing it down when the person
says female fox you just write it as ff just for just for convenience so you know I can say
all female foxes are ffs and then transform that into all female foxes are female foxes because
the term ff is just stipulated as an abbreviation for female fox the problem is that most analytic
truths are not supposed to be mere stipulative definitions I mean in fact most definitions
are not mere stipulative definitions so when I propose a definition of the word vixen I'm not
just stipulating that it abbreviates female fox no I have to think about how that word is used I
have to think about what the word means um then you know in this case the language already exists
I'm saying something about meanings that are pre-existent within a language right like we
have this so we have this language already which has the word vixen and it has the expression
female fox and I'm saying you know vixen means female fox um that's something I'm working out
I'm not stipulating it uh so quine says in this kind of case giving a definition of a term can't
explain synonymy because it presupposes synonymy right what it is to define some term a as b is
to suppose that a and b are synonymous so think about like I don't know the process of writing
a dictionary when you do that you might make an error right I mean you know you could get it wrong
uh if if all definitions were just stipulative definitions it would make no sense to speak of
an error here when you stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox you can't be wrong about that it's
not like you've you know you haven't made some mistake um but a dictionary well that can obviously
contain errors that can contain mistakes so you know when we when we're giving a definition we're
trying to stake the meanings that are implicit in some prior usage of the word uh and that means it's
not a stipulation um it's going to presuppose synonymy uh now there is there is a worry about uh
about this part of quine's argument because you might say well you know hang on a minute
quine is granting that there is such a thing as synonymy synonymy occurs in stipulative definitions
moreover quine seems to grant that if there is synonymy then we can define analyticity
in terms of it we can say that the analytic truths of the second class are those that can be
transformed into analytic truths of the first class by substituting synonymous terms so you know
we've we've got synonymy we've got the link between synonymy and analyticity what more do you want
it seems strange that quine grants all of this but then goes on to deny the analytic synthetic
distinction and i guess to push the point further we might say if there's this if there is this
property of synonymy and this property can be created by stipulative definition why can't it
be created in other ways so i think to be clear the problem as quine sees it is that stipulative
definitions are just these sort of devices of convenience we can dot them or drop them without
altering our theories without any kind of epistemic loss i mean again you know it's it's like it's
like i'm just sort of copying a speech and then i just introduce a new symbol and that like that's
all i'm doing um and maybe this does give us some kind of analyticity um but the it's not going to
be a kind that can do any important philosophical work um you know remember philosophers don't just
draw this distinction between analytic and synthetic truths like just for its own sake
they see this distinction as doing important work such as explaining a priori knowledge or
explaining necessary truths or providing some foundation for logical mathematical and philosophical
inquiry um a mere stipulative definition is not going to bear this weight uh and so i think i do
think you know quine is he's at times sort of a little bit unclear about the uh about how how
force about like maybe how general his thesis is supposed to be right because on the one hand
you know he denies the analytic synthetic distinction but then he does just kind of grant
for the sake of argument that there are analytic truths of the first class so there is a kind of
analyticity that he's granting um and similarly you know he grants that okay yeah you know you can
you can have stipulative definitions um but i think the important thing to see is that
analytic truths of the first class stipulative definitions this sort of thing this isn't going
to do the work that philosophers have put the analytic synthetic distinction to right you know
they they're using this distinction for certain purposes and we're not going to be able to get
that out of the the sort of trivial kinds of analyticity that quine is just granting um you
know when philosophers debate about the correct analysis of knowledge they're not just stipulating
some uh you know some abbreviation for the term knowledge right okay when i say you know vixen
is synonymous with female fox i'm not just stipulating a definition so quine uh quine concludes
well this appeal to definition is really not going to help right because you're either going
to end up talking about stipulative definitions which are just too trivial to to do the sorts of
work that we we're wanting or you're going to end up presupposing synonymy um so you haven't
explained synonymy you're just going to end up presupposing it okay then quick advert um if you

and a phd in philosophy so i'm more than qualified to do that send an email if you're interested and
i have a discord the link to all of this stuff will be in the description um okay then let's
move on so uh synonymy doesn't work quine says uh so he then turns to another idea another suggestion
which is we might say that two expressions are synonymous just in case they are interchangeable
salva veritate uh what the hell does this mean uh well the idea is is that one expression
can be replaced with the other expression without without altering the truth value of
the sentences in which those expressions occur so if i take vixen and female fox the idea is well
any sentence containing the term vixen in in any sentence which has that term this term can be
replaced with the phrase female fox without changing the truth value of the sentence and
you know vice versa so if i if i take verity is a vixen i can change that to verity is a female
fox and these are going to be true under the same conditions right so the same conditions under
which verity is a vixen is true will be the conditions under which verity is a female fox
is true no matter how we sort of alter the world these are going to have the same truth value um or
vixens have four legs to female foxes have four legs again true under the same conditions
there are vixens on mars to there are female foxes on mars true under the same conditions
hunting vixens ought to be banned hunting female foxes ought to be banned true under the same
conditions and so on and so on for any sentence so for any sentence of the language right we can
we can sort of switch these terms out and they're going to be true under the same conditions
And of course that's not the case for for just any pair of terms, obviously, right? You know if
you replace the term, so verity is a vixen, replace vixen with the term bachelor. Verity is a vixen,
verity is a bachelor. These are not true under the same conditions. One can be true and the other
can be false. But this is not the case with vixen and female fox. It can't be that, you know, one
of these sentences is true and the other one is false. Now there are immediate limitations
to this idea. So take for instance the statement vixen has five letters.
That's true. Female fox has five letters. Well that's false. Now coin does point out, well you can get
around this pretty straightforwardly by appealing to a use-mention distinction, right? When I say
that vixen has five letters, the word the word vixen is mentioned not used. I'm not actually
using the word vixen. So the idea is is that when we can treat vixen enclosed in quotation marks
as a new word which refers to the word vixen. So when I say vixen has five letters, I'm mentioning
the word vixen. I'm essentially using a new word that's constructed by enclosing vixen in quotation
marks to refer to the word vixen and then I'm talking about the properties of that word. I
mean I could just as well say that the word fred refers to the word vixen and then I could say
fred has five letters and that would be true if we've stipulated that fred is referring to vixen,
the word vixen, right? Fred is referring to the word vixen. So when I say fred has five letters,
that's like a name. That's a name for the word vixen. Similarly when I enclose vixen in quotation
marks and I say quote quote vixen end quote has five letters, right? When I say that I'm
using this vixen enclosed in quotation marks as a name for the word vixen. So of course
we can't then substitute it for female fox because it's a new word. So this is not a counter example
to interchangeability salva veritate. A more serious concern though raised by Quine is that
whether two expressions are interchangeable salva veritate depends on the expressive resources of
the language that we're dealing with. So take the phrases creature with heart and creature with kidneys.
These phrases have the same extension that is to say they pick out the same things in the actual
world. So as a matter of fact any creature that has a heart is also a creature with a kidney.
So consider the following statements, right? All creatures with hearts are creatures with
hearts. All creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys. Both of these statements are true.
Now if our language contains only the resources to refer to the actual world,
then creature with heart and creature with kidney will be interchangeable salva veritate.
So if you imagine a language where like you know it's a sort of simple language and you know all
the language can do is just refer to like concrete objects in the actual world. So you know I have
the ability to talk about like the table, the cup, the creature with a heart, the creature with a kidney
but like that's it. You know I can't talk about what might have been or what could have been.
I can't talk about what people believe to be the case or anything like that. Like all I can do is
just refer to objects and attribute properties to them and the objects in the actual world.
You know no fiction, no imagination, nothing like that. Just I'm just talking about the objects
that actually exist. In this language creature with heart and creature with kidneys will be
interchangeable because in fact all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys. So clearly
interchangeability in this language is not going to be sufficient to explain analyticity.
We don't want to say that it's an analytic truth that all creatures with hearts are creatures
with kidneys. So you know this is going to be a problem if we're just dealing with this,
if we're dealing with this you know somewhat impoverished language. Interchangeability in
this kind of language isn't efficient because the interchangeability of the terms in this language
rests on matters of fact not on meaning. So okay let's say we add some more predicates to our
language. Suppose we add modal operators so we're now able to say things like necessarily all creatures
with hearts are creatures with hearts. Necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with
kidneys. Well the first statement here is true, the second is false. It's true that necessarily
all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts, false that necessarily all creatures
with hearts are creatures with kidneys. So by substituting the term creature with heart
in this case we do not have interchangeability salveratate. Had evolution taken a different path
then perhaps there could have been creatures with hearts that are not creatures with kidneys.
So we've introduced modal terms in our language, terms like necessarily and possibly,
terms for describing how things must have been or how things could have been and in that case
the expressions creature with heart and creature with kidneys are no longer interchangeable
salveratate. By contrast it looks like we preserve the interchangeability of vixen and female fox.
So you know compare necessarily all vixens of vixens, necessarily all vixens are female foxes.
Well yeah that's still true right. So if we had a good grasp of this term necessarily
then perhaps we could say that two expressions are synonymous just in case they are necessarily
interchangeable salveratate. The trouble as quite as far as quite is concerned is that we have no
better understanding of necessity and these other modal notions than we do of analyticity. Indeed
remember as we noted at the beginning part of the work that philosophers are using the
analytic synthetic distinction for was to explain necessary truths. So like necessity
is explained in terms of analyticity in which case we can't presuppose necessity in order to
explain analyticity. Now I mean of course these days you know we might we might challenge
coin's argument here. The development of modal logic and possible world semantics has as far as
most philosophers are concerned given as a solid foundation for understanding these sorts of modal
claims. But you know this is like this is the problem right like as far as coin is concerned well
appealing to necessity right well one of the problems right one problem here is this appeal
to necessity isn't really going to help because necessity is no better understood than analyticity
is. Analyticity is supposed to explain necessity and it might actually be worth noting that even
if we did grant this prior understanding of necessity there are actually other contexts
that are going to raise trouble for the interchangeability criterion. So suppose I say
Sidney believes that there is a female fox in his garden versus Sidney believes that there's a vixen
in his garden. Now suppose that Sidney is unaware that vixens are female foxes Sidney thinks that
vixen is a term for female stoats then arguably it may be true that Sidney has the belief there is
a female fox in my garden but false that Sidney has the belief there is a vixen in my garden.
I mean if you were to ask Sidney like okay do you think there's a vixen in your garden he'd say no
do you think there's a female fox in your garden he'd say yes. And you know I mean appealing to
necessity doesn't really seem to help with this kind of case in fact you know if you have a you
could you could have a sort of more impoverished language which does not have modal operators
but as long as it's got the you know the belief operator as long as we can refer to people's
beliefs well now it looks like interchangeability fails here because we want to say that vixen
is synonymous with female fox but they're not interchangeable salveritate that might be a worry
like okay so yeah this is this is a concern the general point is this right if we consider a simple
language that's purely extensional but only describes the actual matters of fact interchangeability
cannot define analyticity because any co-referring terms will be interchangeable if the language
contains operators like necessarily well yeah in that case interchangeability might be sufficient
but we don't understand necessity so we're no further in an explanation of analyticity and of
course if the language contains you know belief operators then it seems again that interchangeability
no longer works so interchangeability like whether or not two terms are interchangeable
depends on the expressive resources of the language in question okay quine
then moves on to a final suggestion perhaps the problem here is ordinary language natural languages
are vague and messy and it can be unclear where to draw the lines between different concepts so
we have this intuitive grasp of the analytic synthetic distinction but maybe it's unsurprising
that a precise characterization of this distinction would be unavailable for ordinary languages
we can perhaps gain greater clarity by proposing an artificial language with explicit semantical
rules so think about you know propositional logic with its precise vocabulary and logical operators
whose behavior is precisely defined according to the truth tables so you know we we we construct
a new language an artificial language uh where we just lay down the rules of the language now
according to quine analyticity is going to remain unclear even if we just consider the artificial
languages okay so the most straightforward way to appeal to semantic rules here is to think about
a formal language that explicitly specifies all of its analytic statements so imagine a set of
rules where the rules just tell us directly which statements count as analytic and which count as
synthetic quine says well this isn't going to help us understand analyticity in a language with with
such rules we can understand what statements the rules attribute analyticity to but we won't by
this method understand what analyticity is indeed there won't really be anything that analyticity
is just from a set of rules that say these things are analytic i mean like if i i'd like to introduce
some new word you know flab right and you don't know what like and you don't have an understanding
of what flab is and then i say well look i've got this artificial language and the artificial language
has these rules which you know distinguish okay these are the flab statements these are the non-flab
statements that's useless right that doesn't help you understand flab at all um so i mean
in the case of analyticity right think about you know you could have an artificial language where
there's just some rule which says a statement s is analytic for l just in case s contains at
least 10 letters i mean nothing stops you from constructing an artificial language and then just
having that as one of the rules of the language uh and and you would have a very straightforward
way of identifying the analytic statements within that language but clearly this is
an unusual use of the term analytic it has nothing to do with the analytic synthetic
distinction as philosophers have used it uh it you know it doesn't have anything to do with the
analytic synthetic distinction in the intuitive sense that we explained at the beginning of this
video um but you know maybe this is a bit too simplistic there's a so instead of using semantic
rules to specify the analytic statements directly there's an alternative way to approach this we
might say well look a language is going to contain semantic rules which tell us that certain statements
must be among the truths so certain statements are among the truths the rules these rules are not
going to appeal to some prior understanding of analyticity they just stipulate certain
statements of the language that are true so it's we just postulate certain truths so all we need
is the notion of truth um for instance a semantic rule in an artificial language like you know
that's based on classical logic might be all statements of the form not p and not p are true
or maybe you know if p is false then if p then q is true now these rules do not tell us all of
the truths of the language they they specify a class of statements that are to count as true
and having stipulated certain truths within the language that we can then take for granted we can
then apply the language in other areas of inquiry and you know work out what other things are true
within the language and so on um but maybe we can now characterize analyticity by saying a statement
s is analytic for l just in case s is not just true but true according to the semantic rules of l
we might have an artificial language with the rule that uh not p and not p is true from which it
follows that it is not the case that there are unicorns and there are no unicorns is true um
or consider a language for describing colors uh we might stipulate as a rule of this language
that objects can only have one color in the same respect from the same perspective so
you know this language attributes to each surface one color and one color only and it follows from
this that the statement nothing is both red all over and green all over at the same time is true
um so you know i mean this kind of thing is presumably only going to work for artificial
languages natural languages you know i mean don't appear to have explicitly stated semantic rules
like this but even in the context of artificial languages there is a problem what exactly counts
as a semantic rule we don't want to say that every true statement which says that some statements are
true counts as a semantic rule because otherwise literally all of the truths in the language would
come out as analytic for instance it's true that there are eight planets so now imagine i was to
just say well it's a semantic here's a semantic rule the sentence there are eight planets is true
okay surely this doesn't count as a semantic rule because otherwise we could we could just have a
semantic rule for every true sentence and then every true sentence would would end up being analytic
so the difficulty is how do we distinguish the genuine semantic rules rules like all statements of
the form not p and not p are true how do we distinguish those from these kind of art like
artificial gerrymandered semantic rules like the statement there are eight planets is true
but what's what's the difference um the general problem here is that if we're constructing
an artificial language then in principle we can we can just take any statements we like
as the basic postulates right so we can we can actually just postulate that there are eight
planets is true on the other hand if we're investigating a language that already exists
like english well how yeah i mean how do we tell which statements count as postulates i mean there's
not it doesn't look like there's any facts of the matter as quine says any finite selection of
statements preferably true ones perhaps is as much a set of postulates as any other and that's the case
regardless of whether we're dealing with with natural languages or artificial languages so
quine says that we have gotten no further here um i mean obviously the natural the natural answer
to like what distinguishes a genuine semantic rule from a merely artificial one is going to be
something about well the meanings of the terms um but then that's presupposing analyticity
so quine summarizes semantical rules determining the analytic statements of an artificial language
are of interest only in so far as we already understand the notion of analyticity they are
of no help in gaining this understanding so quine concludes that we have no way of drawing the
distinction between analytic and synthetic truths the general idea of his argument is that the term
analytic is one of a circle of terms where if any one of those terms could be adequately understood
then we could define the others in terms of it so there's terms like self-contradictory
necessarily synonymous definition semantic rule the problem the problem is none of these
terms have been adequately explained any attempt to explain one of them will end up appealing to
the other terms in the circle so you know to explain analyticity we appeal to synonymy
to explain synonymy we appeal to necessity to explain necessity we appeal to analyticity
right at some so at some point we always end up either bottoming out in some just you know vague
term that's poorly understood always circle back around to analyticity itself um so we end up you
know it ends up becoming circular none of these concepts have been shown to be capable of bearing
the weight that philosophers have placed on them uh and as far as quine is concerned there's no reason
to think that there is actually a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic um
now it's worth noting before we end that many philosophers have taken quine's argument to have
the fairly radical consequence that there actually just isn't any such thing as the meaning of a
sentence in fact in later work quine himself is explicit that he you know he's sort of attacking
the very notion of meaning it's not just that there are no sentences that are true in virtue of
meaning it's that there's no such thing as like the meaning of a sentence period um see my videos
on quine's arguments for the indeterminacy of meaning for more on this but with respect to the
analytic synthetic distinction here's the reason in brief suppose that sentences have meanings
um in their response to quine christ and strawson point out that this would allow a very straightforward
definition of synonymy as follows we could say two sentences are synonymous if and only if any
true answer to the question what does it mean asked of one of them is a true answer to the same
question asked of the other so if you take verity as a vixen and verity as a female fox right ask
for each of these sentences what does it mean the correct answer will be the same in both cases
so two sentences synonymous just in case they mean the same thing and with this you know we break
into the circle of terms and can define analyticity of course quine is going to say well we can't do
that um if we give up analyticity then we seem to have to give up sentence meaning at the very
least we have to give up the idea that there is a determinant fact of a matter about the meaning
of a sentence now in practice we might well ask the question what does it mean of two different
sentences and we might give the same answer each time but on quine's view we can't say that this
answer is correct or incorrect when we talk about the meaning of a sentence that's going to be more
like a useful fiction or an idealization um indeed as far as quine is concerned the sort of
unit of meaning is an entire language or an entire theory of the world some sentences are more
resistant to refutation than others but it's the whole theory that is tested against experience
and there's no sharp line between synthetic statements that can be refuted and analytic
statements that are true come what may and there's no so there's no determinant fact of the matter
about you know what a sentence means for any sentence it you know its its truth is going to be
it you know the kind of conceptual and the empirical is intertwined right um for any sentence
the truth is going to be a matter of like meaning and the matter of fact but where we are not going
to be able to identify or sort of isolate the meaning of the sentence independently of this
sentence's role in the whole theory um it was noting as well that quine's argument also threatens
the idea of logical truths what quine called analytic statements of the first class we noted
that quine does not object to logical truths you know he grants in his argument that if we could
define synonymy then we could say that an analytic truth is any statement that can be transformed
into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms so he seems to you know at least in in
his article you know he's granting logical truth but we might think well actually there's a bit of
a problem here because let's take a logical truth you know of the form right for all x
if vx then vx or you know for all x if x is a vixen then x is a vixen or more colloquially
all vixens are vixens right that's an instance of a logical truth but this only works if each
instance of vixen has the same meaning right so if the first token of vixen means female foxes
and the second token of vixen means attractive women then obviously this statement is false
so ordinarily we would say that this kind of thing isn't a counter example to logical truth
because it would be equivocating on the term vixen when we characterize logical truths we have to
specify that different tokens of the same expressions have the same meaning it must be
that the first token of vixen is synonymous with the second token of vixen without sameness of meaning
it's not quite so obvious how we are to understand logical truth so you know maybe coin's argument
is a bit more radical than even he initially intended and with that said i'm going to leave
that video there those were coins arguments against the analytic synthetic distinction
and that's all for today thanks for watching bye
