1. **Writing Down Thoughts**: It's often when our thoughts are most confusing that they hold the most value. Writing down these thoughts can clarify them and potentially lead to new insights or ideas. If you find it hard to write something down, it might be an indication that there's a valuable idea in there waiting to be explored.

2. **Neutrality Towards Popularity**: When deciding what to work on, avoid being swayed by popularity. Instead, focus on what you find important and potentially fruitful, regardless of whether it's a popular topic or not.

3. **Prioritizing Ideas**: To decide on the next thing to work on, write down all the ideas that seem interesting to you. Explain each one to understand them better. Narrow down your list by eliminating redundancies and considering which idea(s) you can realistically start working on now.

4. **Research and Experimentation**: Many of your ideas won't work out right away, and that's okay. The process of research and experimentation is part of the journey towards finding a valuable and unique contribution.

5. **Keeping Records**: Whether it's physical notebooks or digital files, keeping records of your thoughts and experiments can be beneficial for revisiting and refining ideas over time.

6. **Progress and Satisfaction**: There's something satisfying about physically writing in a notebook and being able to see progress on paper. However, transitioning to digital note-taking can make it easier to search through your ideas and maintain them without taking up as much physical space.

7. **Reflective Learning**: The process of articulating your thoughts, whether out loud or onto a page, is a form of reflective learning that can lead to new insights and personal growth.

8. **Gratitude for the Opportunity**: It's important to be grateful for opportunities to share ideas and learn from others. The conversations and reflections prompted by such interactions are invaluable.

In summary, the key to progress is to continuously write down your thoughts, maintain a neutral stance towards popularity, prioritize and refine your ideas, keep detailed records of your work, and be open to the process of research and experimentation. Reflective learning and maintaining a sense of gratitude for opportunities to engage with others on these topics are also crucial components of the journey.

Checking Amii/Special Announcement： John Carmack & Rich Sutton partner to accelerate development of AGI.txt
1. **Open Research and Sharing Insights:** John believes in sharing insights, breakthroughs, and even code when it comes to AI in video games. However, he draws a line with proprietary technologies, especially around experiment design and architectures for AGI, which he considers too sensitive to share publicly.

2. **Commercial Realities:** He understands the importance of commercial incentives and recognizes that there are reasons why businesses operate under certain models. There is a balance between open research and protecting proprietary technology that provides a competitive advantage.

3. **Employee Turnover and NDAs:** John acknowledges the risk of valuable knowledge and intellectual property leaving the company through employee turnover or even despite NDAs. This is a significant concern in the industry, especially with cutting-edge technologies like AGI.

4. **Incentives for Open Source:** He expressed his disappointment that we haven't progressed further in making compiler toolchains and game engines open source given the benefits it would bring to the world.

5. **Future of AI and Collaboration:** John sees a future where the most significant breakthroughs in AI will be collaborative efforts, with a thin chapter in the future textbooks that covers what was necessary to make AGI happen, built on a baseline developed by the community.

6. **Risk and Reward:** He emphasized that even though the value of the technology could dissipate into the broader world (which is good for humanity), it's still a risk for investors who are funding this research and development. The company is willing to take this risk because of the potential positive impact on the world.

In summary, John emphasizes the importance of balancing open research with proprietary development, recognizing both the benefits and challenges of sharing knowledge in the AI field, and acknowledging the risks associated with protecting intellectual property while still aiming for a positive impact on the world.

Checking Amii/The Tea Time Talks： Rich Sutton, Open Questions in Model-based RL (May 27, 2019).txt
1. **Model Dynamics vs State Representation**: The complexity in an expectation model lies primarily in the state update function rather than the state representation itself. The dynamics of the system are captured by this function, which determines how the state evolves over time.

2. **Collaboration and Progress**: The speaker acknowledges new collaborators, Mohammed, Zaheer, and Yi Wan, for their work on an expectation model paper that was accepted at NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems).

3. **Linear vs Nonlinear Models**: Linearity in the features of a model is crucial because it allows for the representation of complex interactions by transforming the features into a linear context. A nonlinear function can be approximated by adding linear features that capture the necessary interactions (e.g., conjunctions).

4. **Nonlinear Interactions**: While a simple model might not directly handle interactions between variables, neural networks like AlphaGo learn complex functions with multiple layers, effectively dealing with such interactions indirectly. In essence, the network learns to create the necessary features in higher-level layers that represent these interactions.

5. **Strategy for Handling Nonlinearity**: The speaker suggests that instead of trying to directly model nonlinear interactions, it might be more efficient to engineer the state representation to include the outcomes of these interactions, thus making the model linear and simplifying the problem. This approach requires the model to implicitly or explicitly create the relevant features within its layers if it were to learn a nonlinear map.

6. **Question on Model Applicability**: The speaker is asked whether the model can handle complex scenarios like an eagle hunting ducks, which involves nonlinear interactions. The response is affirmative, as the model can be designed to account for such interactions by transforming the problem into a linear one through feature engineering.

7. **Potential Misinterpretation**: The speaker clarifies that nonlinearity does not represent a principal limitation and that neural networks demonstrate this by learning complex functions with many layers, where each layer operates linearly but collectively captures nonlinear relationships.

In summary, the key takeaway is that complexity in state updates can be managed through careful feature engineering and that linear models can approximate nonlinear phenomena by considering all necessary interactions within the state representation. The speaker advocates for a strategy where the model's complexity is shifted into creating the right features rather than directly handling complex dynamics.

Checking Amii/Upper Bound 2023： Insights Into Intelligence, Keynote by Richard S. Sutton.txt
1. The path to creating superior intelligence likely involves first understanding our own intelligence better, as we are still far from comprehending the full extent of human cognition.

2. While understanding the mind is crucial, it's also conceivable that we could create AI without a complete understanding of it, drawing parallels to how humans reproduce or use technology without fully grasping their intricacies.

3. Elon Musk emphasizes the importance of creation in the pursuit of understanding, echoing Richard Feynman's sentiment that one cannot truly understand what one cannot create.

4. Open source principles are preferred for AI development because they facilitate sharing, collaboration, and the evolution of ideas, which is essential for long-term fundamental research. Sharing and challenging ideas are key to their improvement and should not be kept secret.

5. Intellectual property rights are criticized by Musk as being often counterproductive, costly, and detrimental to the progress of technology and science.

6. AI is seen as a natural continuation of humanity's history of tool-making and our innate drive towards convenience and change, as described by Thomas Hobbes' observation on human behavior.

7. Musk concludes that while AI brings dramatic changes, it also fits within the long-standing trend of human technological evolution, representing a natural next step in our relationship with tools and our pursuit of self-understanding and improvement.
