Okay, great. I'm seeing lots of people into the room. Fantastic.
Okay, welcome everyone. This must have been a parallel session with two papers. Unfortunately,
our second presenter has fallen prey to this thing that's going around and is unable to
join us. Our second presenter is not well. So we will have only one paper in this session.
If you wish to, after the half hour is over, investigate the other parallel sessions and
join for the last two papers in the middle of the session. That's completely fine. That's
what I'm planning to do. Okay, also to note that this session is being recorded. Just to
emphasize that, I know you've had to click for your permission, but I do feel I should note it
at the beginning. Okay, so to introduce our last speaker standing, Helen Hooper from North
Umbria University, who will be talking about enhancing university mentoring practice,
direct theory analysis of lived experiences of learning and teaching mentors. Helen, handing
over to you now. Okay, so I'm just sharing my slides. We did a tech check. So I hope hopefully
this is yes. So I'm assuming that somebody shows they can't see anything. I'm assuming
the slide is still okay. So I'm absolutely delighted to be here and unaffected by the seasonal
bag. Thank goodness. And for the next 20 minutes or so, I'll be presenting on behalf of my
wonderful collaborative team members at Northumbria University. And what I'm going to be
aiming to do is to discuss some initial findings of an ongoing collaborative project. And my
wonderful collaborative team members are all from across the university, from different
faculties, different departments, including staff from a central quality enhancement team. But
we've got this shared goal of really trying to dig in and explore the experiences of staff
across the Institute who mentor their colleagues to develop their teaching activity. And we've
got to share this shared goal, this shared interest, because we're really motivated to
try and improve the support and recognition for teaching and learning mentors. It builds
on a previous project and I can dig into that as we go through the presentation. So in terms of
some kind of general scene setting, I don't think it would be too controversial to say that mentoring
to help colleagues develop their teaching and learning practices is considered pretty important,
pretty essential. And there are a number of studies which have really attempted to look at the
impacts of mentoring colleagues to support their teaching development. And those research studies
which have focused on looking at the impacts, there's a general consensus that really mentoring
those colleagues really enhances the quality of the learning and teaching that results
to many ways. And there's a various studies that have dug into various aspects.
So they help colleagues to develop their understanding and their knowledge about
learning and teaching in general, but also and importantly, it facilitates that knowledge
transfer. So does that knowledge and understanding of how learning and teaching best practice
works? Does it facilitate that to be actually incorporated in colleagues practice? And it
does. And if anybody is interested in the citations here, I've put in a really useful systematic
review of the literature looking at how mentoring for teaching and learning enhances
the quality of learning and teaching that results. Now, in complete contrast, there's a real gap in
the literature. And there's very little research that actually focuses on
mental experiences and the perceptions about mentoring. So why, what motivates people to
become a learning and teaching mentor? What are the values and opinion engagement? Do learning
and teaching mentors perceive existing supports effective? Do they perceive their learning and
teaching mentoring role as valued within their team, within their discipline, within the department
or across the institute more generally? And I suppose our starting point for this is mentoring
is really underdeveloped as a pedagogical approach for Hansing teaching. The literature out there
suggests that mentoring really does enhance teaching. But if we know very little about
what mentors, experiences and perceptions are, then that's a real target, I suppose, for us as
academic developers and educational developers more generally to try and target and enhance support
and enhance recognition for our mentoring colleagues. So that's our shared goal.
So in terms of setting the scene then, I'm just one of a larger group of 11 brilliant
colleagues and we've come from all faculties at my institute, a wide range of departments,
including colleagues in the central quality enhancement team. So it really is an interdisciplinary
group. We're all really, really quite experienced, learning and teaching mentors. We provide training
across the institute and within our department, as well as acting as mentors ourselves.
And this builds upon a previous research project which focused on trying to improve the support
for new academic staff being inducted into learning and teaching. And what came out of that
project were a whole range of things which did result in improved practice and process.
But what came out of that in particular was the central role that new academic staff perceived
mentoring to have on an effective induction into teaching and learning experience.
And the other thing that came out of this side by side, so mentoring is really important for a
new staff member to feel really happy and supported for that induction process to be effective,
but also how inconsistent it was and how uneven and how different the experiences
of new academic staff were across the university in terms of the mentors they were given,
in terms of the type of mentoring and all sorts of things. So that always remained with us and
we thought, right, the next project we really need to try and do is to dig into the mentor
and aspect to really get that improved as well. So in terms of research, James, then we want to
really dig in and understand the perceptions of learning and teaching and mentoring amongst
mentors themselves to identify contradictions, inconsistencies and evenness in mentoring
across the institute and to use these findings as a good evidence basis for proposing changes to
both policy and practice across the institute to improve the support we give to mentors and
to really make sure that their excellent mentoring activities is properly recognised.
Now, I mentioned this project builds upon a previous project exploring the induction
experiences of new academic staff and we've utilised the same methodological approach
because it is so good and it always surprises me how the chat, so collaborative historical
activity theory, in my opinion, should be used far more widely, especially for collaborative
research projects in higher education. It is just so useful and it just fits the bill
so brilliantly if your aim is to really try and drive, drive forward change.
So it's a theory which encompasses expansive learning amongst the collaborative team,
so it really challenges collaborators to question the notions of your academic agency
in terms of suggestion improvements as a basis for change and it's all about transformation
through collaborative reflection. Now, this might sound a little bit complicated if you've not come
across this before. So chat, cultural historical activity theory, it focuses on socially situated
learning, so thinking about everyday tasks, so in this case we're focusing on the experiences of
learning and teaching mentors to try and identify ways to improve support for them and to increase
recognition for the brilliant role that they do and we do that by setting out and mapping
a specific activity system for mentoring. So an activity system is defined through six
interconnected elements which are listed on the bottom of the slide here, so this is a bit of
a busy slide. The next slide shows this in terms of an image, so if it looks a bit confusing here
hopefully it'll be a little bit clearer in the next slide. So there is a subject of any activity
system and we sat down as a collaborative team and mapped this out for learning and teaching
mentoring, so the subject of our activity system is the learning and teaching mentor. The subject
engages in an object of activity, so here the activity is effective, we defined it as effective
mentoring for learning and teaching in higher education and obviously that activity occurs
within some kind of community, so is that predominantly within a department or a discipline
or do actually effective mentors rely in part or predominantly on into disciplinary or institutional
networks or communities of practice. These are very sociocultural in nature and the remaining
three elements of the activity system on the right hand side of the bottom of this slide
are much more structural or institutional in nature, so you've got a mentor engaging in mentoring
in the community but that is mediated often by institutionally dictated tools and resources,
so for example what training or CPD is available for new mentors, is there any further training
available for experienced and mentors and so on. There are rules defining that activity,
so for example many institutions have targets for new academic staff to achieve fellowship of
advanced HE and there's a formal process of allocating that new staff member, a trained
mentor to guide them through that process and obviously then there's lots of conflicts and
contradictions in terms of how many things do people have to do, so the division of labour
for example is there a workload allocated for that formal mentoring and how is all of the excellent
informal mentoring that occurs allocated for in terms of division of labour, so if that previous
slide was a little bit busy maybe this slide makes it a little bit clearer, so you can see
two triangles, a large one on the outside and a smaller one on the inside, the sociocultural
elements of this activity system, the subject and mentor engaging in the object of the activity
system which is effective mentoring for to support colleagues, develop their learning and teaching
and that's within a community so it might be a departmental or institutional community and then
that sits within this outer triangle, the three remaining most structural elements of the activity
system, so what are the rules, what are the tools and resources and you know this
contradiction in terms of time available, so how do you spend your time, what's the division of
labour, so we sat down as a collaborative team, we mapped out the activity system and then in
terms of generating data and how we progressed with the analysis, each individual team member spent
quite a lot of time writing an individual vignette about how learning and teaching mentoring
occurred within their team or their discipline, that informed the development of an online survey,
we used the JISC online survey to contain both quantitative and open-ended questions, so for
example a quantitative question do you get a workload, how much of a workload do you get
and then open-ended questions such as do you perceive your mentor, learning and teaching
mentoring role is valued, what are the challenges or the benefits associated with it and so on
and in terms of the analysis it's very iterative back and forth between the data, the activity
system to make sure that the theme codes were organised around the nodes of the activity system
and really focusing on surfacing typical patterns and contradictions because then we
can use those as the basis for improvements to institutional policy and procedure,
just checking the time, I want to spend some time on the findings, so again this might be a
little bit of a busy slide and I'll give you a little bit of time to read these kinds of
typical themes and contradictions that our team, my team has come together to consider
and let's start on the left hand side here, not one respondent to the survey had ever been asked,
so these are really experienced mentors from across the university and I'm sure hopefully,
I'm guessing that some people in the audience today have engaged in mentorship for teaching and
learning, have you ever been asked yourself as a practitioner, is the support for mentoring
effective, do you think your role is valued, do you get a workload, not one of our participants
had ever been asked those basic questions about that really valuable role before, now on the flip
side I was really surprised by how happy and collegiate people were to engage in this kind of
role, there was some conflict and contradictions in terms of respondents, perceptions about whether
or not you should be mentoring for a whole academic, at my institute and at many institutes
mentoring for learning and teaching is separate and distinct, including a separate person
for learning and teaching as opposed to research and there are various reasons for that
and conflict and contradictions in terms of whether or not that's perceived to be effective
or whether on balance mentoring for the whole academic is an ideal that we should maybe be
trained to work towards. This is an interesting one, there is an assumption and I think I was
guilty of this myself that if you're good at something, so if you were if you're an effective
teacher then you'd be an effective mentor in helping colleagues develop their teaching
practice and that is probably not so true and in terms of the institutional support
for mentor training, it's very much focused on helping new and relatively inexperienced colleagues
gain fellowship around THE because that's the institutional KPI associated with activity,
very little development for example for colleagues who need to be working in professional practice
so lots of really rich data coming in from both the vignettes and the surveys for
mentors across the university. Now just to spend a few moments on some initial reflections and
learnings, again the chat theory really has promoted expansive learning amongst our collaborative team
and at the moment we're sitting down and we're in the process of thinking through the implications
in terms of suggestions and things we want to take forward to really try and improve the
institutional support and the recognition for our brilliant learning and teaching mentors.
So something we really do need to work on is to get to a reasonable level of recognition and
reward especially in formal processes and procedures, so for example promotional processes, appraisal
process and things like we've got an institutional scheme for professional recognition by Advanced
HEE, can we embed some criteria there for senior fellowship or principal fellowship
and we're kicking around ideas as well for a more celebratory approach so can we give some kind of
institutional prize or can there be a small pot of funding for CPD or research and so on.
Unsurprisingly I'm guessing for some of you would be inconsistent mentor workload so some
people had to workload others were completely unaware if they did and if they did it was hidden in
some kind of workload spreadsheet so there's not even a line on the workload spreadsheet
so I think there is a real need to increase mental workload and to get that implemented a bit more
consistently. A really strong feedback in terms of this really crucial role basically being invisible
especially the informal kind of mentoring that goes on every single day so a reliance on going
above and beyond and professional generosity. Something we hadn't thought about was what's
the best mentee and mental pairings should they actually be sort of termined, discipline based,
interdiscipline based and that's something that we're going to think about and I really like
colleagues feedback and ideas on any of these so if there's an opportunity for me to
to steal some good practice I'm definitely going to do that and take it back to to my
colleagues at Northumbria. There's definitely a need for a little bit of extra training especially
for mentors who are helping colleagues develop their practice for professional practice rather
than just teaching at a university kind of standard approaches and what also came out of this was
how much mentors gain from mentoring mentees who have brilliant knowledge to share and especially
things like digital literacy so I'm currently mentoring a relatively new staff who has very
little teaching experiences but absolutely fantastic on generative AI an area which I know
very very little about so I think we do have capacity here to promote the benefits and to
capture the benefits of reciprocal mentoring regardless of status or prior experience or
anything along those lines. So I think with just maybe one or two minutes left I'm probably going
end there and I really really welcome any comments or questions or any good practice that
you'd like to share.
I'm getting my screen back. Thank you very much. That was a really interesting presentation.
If anyone has any questions in the who in the attendance list here please do let me know pop
it in the chat or just raise your your hand electronically. I was really interested Helen
in that last slide where you were talking about the the potential benefits and you were talking
about the mentor mentee pairings and how these might be rethought how the organization of those
might be rethought and I was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how those are currently
arranged at Northumbria does it vary across department or yeah so it'll be really interested
again to get other people's kind of perspectives on this so at Northumbria even though it's a
reasonably large and quite complex kind of organization and my own faculty is split on
two different campuses really quite large departmental and discipline based teams we still
have this kind of one we have this notional one university approach but then when you actually
dig in and actually go and have a look at what happens in departments and discipline teams
it's clearly not a one university approach so what's really nice about doing these kinds of
projects is to actually find out what happens in reality regardless of the notional one university
approach to processes and practices so in my own department I allocate formal mentors to new
academic staff and what I generally tend to do is to allocate a mentor from outside the direct
program or disability team because then there's no kind of conflicts of interest in terms of a
deep bit of teaching practice going on and you also get opportunity to share good practice across
the department more generally it also gives new academic members of staff a wider network
outside their initial disability team because they can draw on expertise and they get to know
people from other programs or other areas but that's very different to other departments and
disciplines so in some of the more professionally oriented departments and programs there's very
much an allocate from that specific discipline area because there's niche knowledge that is
really helpful for the new academic staff member to to get on board with and to understand
so I'm not so sure that there's a correct answer to that but it's not something that I ever thought
about before and what I did after thinking about this because this came out of the data analysis
was take this back to my own departmental teaching and learning enhancement team and say look we've
always done this in the past but there's these other ways of thinking about things and doing things
shall we try something new or actually if it's not broken shall we not fix it so I think what
what's good about this approach and what's good about this method is it stimulates that discussion
and that collaborative reflection and it also I find this so valuable myself it's about the
academic agency you are the captain of your own destiny what are we going to do as a team
to try and make things a bit better for everybody so that was that was a bit of a long winded and
did I answer your question no it's all it's just all really interesting isn't it I mean
yeah that that perspective is is really interesting I see that Richard Davies has
his hand raised would you like to post your question and yeah thanks very much and my
question really is about the design of the chat system and I guess my question is is
to what extent the data confirms this kind of setting out of it or whether there are multiple
ways in which the activity system could be laid out in relation both I think to the different
kinds of communities and different rules but also whether or not how you think about what the
object is and the output of them and to what extent it feeds into the activity
system of teaching and learning itself and I just I just wanted to really add thoughts about
whether this was a where this was a kind of a strong activity this theoretically strong
activity system or whether it was it was a kind of a heuristic and there were alternatives that
might also fit the data thanks yeah Richard so I think this is this I think we could talk about
that for probably about an hour or something so this is the second project that I've been
involved with which utilised the activity system and this chat approach and I come from a kind of
hard science background so my background is a molecular biologist and a colleague of mine
Sue Matheson who's in the central quality enhancement team is an educational developer
by practice and by research so she really led on on teaching us and and developing our knowledge
and understanding of this approach so that's the caveat to what I'm going to say I've been
involved with it for about five years we've done a couple of projects but I don't really consider
myself to be an expert in the field I'm kind of more of a practitioner but in putting into practice
think I think about it as a really valuable tool both for data generation and analysis but also
for personal and practitioner educational development so I think I gain as much out of it as
what we learn from the participants responses and so on so to try and answer your question a
bit more focused so with this activity system the one I presented is probably about both iteration
so we go away we have a thing we come back and we draft it out and then we talk about it
and then we go away we have a thing about it in practice we come back and we talk about it
and so we get to a stage as a collaborative team so there's 11 of us from all four faculties from
eight different departments 10 different disciplines on a central team and we've got that
breadth so I suppose a weakness if you can call it a weakness is I think it would be much more
tighter and focused if I define that within my department but I think that weakness is also a
strength because if you're trying to develop and improve support and recognition for colleagues who
engage in mentorship across the university you do have to have that that kind of the breadth
so if I remember correctly that's about the fourth iteration that we agreed upon where it was general
enough to reflect everybody's practice and understanding but tight enough to be useful
as tool for data analysis and then reflection and the focus of this I think is to identify
those common experiences and contradictions because that's the basis on which then you say
this is what we do reasonably well and we should fight and argue to keep that going but actually
these are things that are unhelpful because they're different in different departments and
there's unmet need for training or it gives you some ideas for things that you haven't tried out
before there could be a bit better in your own department so I think if you take that here's
my feeling I think if you take that and maybe try and apply it at your own institute UCLan
I'm guessing that you would come to something pretty similar if you did it across your institute
if you did it in a tighter team it might be a bit different does that make sense does that
answer your question or not have you experienced of it or would you would you say something different
it'd be really interesting to find out no I think I think I think I guess Northumbria and you
can be similar in the sense that we have quite centralized teaching and learning
policies and frameworks so I guess across the institution I would think it would be
interesting to see what it would look like at say some of the you know that's based at one of the
kind of more entrepreneurial universities that's where departments are actually quite
distinct in terms of their culture and activity and potentially more driven by the academic discipline
than perhaps many of our schools are because they're primarily driven by more vocational
occupational concerns so I guess there would be similarities I think my I think where we might
look at differently is is whether we're actually whether we're trying to provide if whether the
outcome is providing effective mentoring or whether it's about providing effective teaching
learning within particular schools so um so that we that so that the effective mentoring will be a
kind of mediating feature I think for us as opposed and that's partly because we're driven by as many
are by RFS requirements in terms of theory of change and impact upon student metrics and so
quite a lot of what we do see the kind of work with staff as as mediating the actual goal which is
the improvements of learning and to some extent teaching kind of almost drops out as a as a final
so what you're doing there is I'm getting deja vu that was our first conversation so how tight
should be the relationship between the subject and the object and we ended up as quite a tight
relationship because if it's mentors it has to be support for mentoring and not everything else
because that's a bit too broad um so so that's that's the but you go through those cycles as a team
to say and to divine it so it's quite a time consuming process but it's very valuable because
it really makes you unpick and think about things that you might either haven't thought about since
you were a new mentor or you'd never thought about before hey thanks um was there a question in the
chat player I've not been keeping an eye on no um one of the questions just want to leave yeah yeah
and was thanking you for for a great session um were there any other questions in the room
otherwise I think we can all exit and go on to another session but um Helen thank you very much
that was really interesting uh you're your perspective on that um I think it's really
interesting work so we'd love to hear back from you again yeah well thanks for listening and thanks
thanks for the input it's fantastic excellent okay and we'll see you again soon yeah brilliant
thanks very much bye everybody bye now
