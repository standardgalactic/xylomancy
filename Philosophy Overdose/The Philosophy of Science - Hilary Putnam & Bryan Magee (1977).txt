The connection between philosophy and the mathematical sciences has always been very
close. Plato had written over the door of his academy the words, let no one enter here
who is ignorant of geometry. It was Aristotle who codified the basic sciences into the category
and gave them the names that were used to this day. Some of the greatest philosophers have
been themselves great mathematicians who invented new branches of mathematics. Descartes is an
obvious example and so is Leibniz and Pascal. In fact most of the great philosophers, not all
but most, came to philosophy from mathematics or the sciences and this tendency has continued
into our present century. Bertrand Russell was trained first as a mathematician, Wittgenstein
was trained first as an engineer. The reason for this persisting connection is I think obvious
and that is that the basic urge which has driven most of the greatest philosophers has been the
urge to deepen our understanding of the world and of its structure and this is also what creative
scientists are doing. For most of the past two people thought that mathematics was the most
indubitable knowledge as well as being utterly precise and clear that human beings possessed. So
there have always been plenty of philosophers examining mathematics to try and find out what
was so special about it and whether this was something that could be applied to the acquisition
of other sorts of knowledge. Ditto with the sciences which were also thought to yield a very
specially safe and certain kind of knowledge. What was it about science that made its results so
reliable? People ask themselves and could its methods, whatever these were, be used in other
fields? These investigations into the concepts and methods and procedures and models that are
involved in mathematics and in science have come to be known as the philosophy of mathematics and
the philosophy of science and it's with these that we're going to be concerned in this programme.
Chiefly with the philosophy of science though in fact we have someone taking part who is expert
in both, Professor Hilary Putnam of Harvard University. Professor Putnam, I'd like to start
our discussion from a standpoint which I think a very large number of our viewers occupy anyway
and it's really this, since the 17th century I suppose there's been a spectacular decline in
religious belief especially in the West and especially among educated people and for millions
the role that used to be taken in life by a worldview based on religion has been increasingly
supplanted by a worldview based on science or at least purporting to be derived from science
anyway and this is still enormously powerful in the whole that it has on people's minds
throughout the West. Probably it affects all of us. So I think I'd like to start this discussion
by getting you to pin down that scientific world outlook which is so influential in the modern
world and which will be underlying a lot of what we're going to have to talk about. Let me dodge
the question a little bit by talking not about what scientists think now but what many scientists
thought a hundred years ago or 75 years ago. Think of doing a crossword puzzle. You might have to
change a few things as you go along but towards the end everything fits and things get added on
one step at a time. That's the way the progress of science looked for 300 years. In 1900 a famous
mathematician David Hilbert gave a list of 50 mathematical problems to a world congress of
mathematicians which are still very famous. It's very interesting that he included one problem
which we would not call a mathematical problem very early in the list. I think it's problem three
which was to put the foundations of physics on a satisfactory basis.
Just a small task and that was for mathematicians. Not for physicists. Not for physicists. Right.
The idea is tidy it up. That's right. The idea is Newton, Maxwell, Dalton and so on had all
put in all the parts of the story and now it was just for mathematicians to basically clean
up the logic as it were. I think in a conversation we had a couple of days ago you described this
as a treasure chest view and I like that picture because here's this big chest that we're just
filling up. It's an accumulation and you don't have to subtract. You don't have to take out.
Occasionally you make a little mistake but basically the idea is or to shift the metaphor
like building a pyramid. You put down the ground floor then the next floor then the next floor
it just goes up. That's part of it. This view of knowledge is growing by accumulation.
The other part of it is the idea that the special success of the sciences and obviously what we're
impressed by is success. This culture values success and science is a successful institution
but there's the idea that science owes its success to using a special method
and that comes partly from the history of science when the fact that Newton for example lived
after bacon and was influenced by bacon and the idea that empirical science has grown up together
with something called inductive logic and this idea that there's a method, the inductive method,
and that the sciences can be characterized by the fact that they use this method and use it
explicitly and consciously as it were, not unconsciously as maybe someone who's learning
cooking might be using it but pretty deliberately and explicitly. So I think that these two things,
the idea of knowledge is growing by accumulation and growing by the use of a special method,
the inductive method are the key elements of the old view. Yes and if I were going to put the same
thing I suppose slightly differently I think I'd say this that for 200 or 300 years educated western
man thought of the universe and everything in it as consisting of matter in motion and that was all
there was whether from the outermost galaxies of the stars into ourselves and our bodies and the
cells of which we're made up and so on and that science was finding out more and more about this
matter and its structure and its motion by a method which you just characterized as scientific method
and the idea was that if we went on long enough we'd simply as you said with your crossword puzzle
metaphor we'd find out everything there was to find out we could eventually by scientific methods
completely explain and understand the world. Now that has been abandoned by scientists hasn't it though
in fact this this hasn't gone through yet to the non-scientists there are still large numbers of
non-scientists who go on thinking that that's how scientists think but of course they no longer do
that I mean this was started to break down I think it started to break down I think it started
to break down with Einstein yes if I can drag in a bit of history philosophies screaming by the hair
Kant did something in philosophy which I think has begun to happen now in science
he challenged a certain view of truth before Kant no philosopher really doubted that truth was
simply correspondence to reality I mean they're different words some philosophers spoke of agreement
but the idea is a mirror theory of knowledge today I think well Kant said it isn't so simple
there's a contribution of the thinking mind sure it isn't made up by the mind Kant was no idealist
it is not a fiction it isn't something we make up but it isn't just a copy either what we call
truth depends both on what there is on the way things are and on the contribution of the thinker
the mind I think that today scientists have come to a somewhat similar view that is since the beginning
of the 20th century the idea that there's a human contribution a mental contribution to what we
call truth the theories aren't simply dictated to us by the facts as it were I'd like to ask you to
unpack that a little because I think that some of our viewers will find this idea a little puzzling
um how can it be some people will ask themselves that what is and is not true can depend not only
on what the facts are but on the human mind how can that be well let me use an analogy with vision
we tend to think that what we see just depends on what's out there but the more one studies vision
either as a scientist or as a painter one discovers that what's called vision involves an enormous
amount of interpretation the color we see as red is not the same color in terms of wavelengths at
different times of the day so that even in what we think of as our simplest transaction with the
world just looking at it we are interpreting you know in other words we bring a whole number of
things to the world that we're not directly conscious of usually unless we turn inwards
and start examining them that's right I think the world must have looked different in the middle
ages to someone who looked up and thought of the stars as up and us at the bottom for example
today when we look out into space I think we have a different experience than somebody with the
medieval worldview and what you're saying is that the very categories in which we see the world and
interpret our experience and the the ideas within which we organize our observations and the facts
around us and so on are provided by us so that the world as conceived by science is partly
contributed by external facts but also partly contributed by categories and ways of seeing
things which come from the human observer that's right and an example of that in science I'll
oversimplify but it's not basically falsified is this wave particle business it's not that
there's something an electron which is somehow half a wave and half a particle that would be
meaningless but that there are many experiments which can be described two ways you can either
think of the electron as a wave or you can think of it as a particle and both descriptions are in
some crazy way true and adequate they're alternative ways of describing the same facts and both
descriptions are accurate that's right philosophers have started talking of equivalent descriptions
there's a term used in philosophy of science but now for a couple of hundred years after Newton
educated western man thought that what Newton had produced was objective fact that he had
discovered laws which governed the workings of the world and the workings of the universe
and this was just objectively true independently of us that Newton and other scientists had read
these facts off of nature by observing it and looking at it and so on and these statements
which made up science were simply true now there came didn't there a period in the development of
science and beginning in the late 19th century when people began to realize that these statements
were not entirely true that this wasn't just a body of objective fact which had been read off
from the world in other words that science was courageable scientific theories could be wrong
and that raises some very profound questions I mean if science isn't just an objectively true
description of the way things are what is it and if we don't get it from observing the world
where do we get it from well I don't want to say we don't get it from observing the world at all
obviously part of this Kantian image is that there is a contribution which is not us there's
something out there but that also there's a contribution from us and even Kant by the way
it's thought that Newtonian science was indubitable in fact he thought we contributed its indubitability
the step beyond Kant is the idea that not only is reality partly mind dependent but that there
are alternatives and that the concepts we impose on the world may not be the right ones and we
may have to change them that there's an interaction between what we contribute and what we find out
but now what was it that made people begin to realize that this basic conception of science
as objective truth was wrong that science was courageable that science was fammable I think it's
that the older science turned out to be wrong where no one expected it to be wrong not in detail
but in the big picture it's not that we find out that say the sun isn't 93 million miles from the
earth but only 20 million miles from the earth that's not going to happen I mean sometimes
it makes blunders even about things like that but that's like making a blunder about whether
there's a chair in the room wholesale skepticism about whether numerical values are right in science
would be as unjustified as wholesale skepticism about anything but where the newer theories
don't agree with Newton it's not over the approximate truth of the mathematical expressions
in Newton's theory those are still perfectly good for calculation it's over the big picture we've
replaced the picture of an absolute space in an absolute time by the picture of a four-dimensional
spacetime we replaced the picture of a Euclidean world by a picture of a world which obeys a
geometry Euclid never dreamed of we've replaced we've swung back to the picture of the world as
having a beginning in time which is really a shocker it's not even the things once refuted
stay refuted forever yes so it means really that a whole conception of science has been superseded
instead of thinking of science as a body of knowledge which is being added to all the time
by further scientific work that whole conception of science has been dispensed with really hasn't
it and we now think of it as a set of theories which are themselves constantly being replaced
by better theories by more accurate theories by richer more explanatory theories and even the
theories we now have like those of Einstein and and his successors will probably be replaced in the
course of time by other better theories by scientists yet unknown isn't that so that's
exactly right in fact scientists themselves make this prediction that is that the the main theories
of the 20th century relativity and quantum mechanics will give way to some other theory which will
interpret both of them and so on forever now this raises a very fundamental question namely the
question what is truth i mean when we say that this or that scientific statement is true or this
or that scientific theory is true what in these newly understood circumstances of ours can we mean
by truth the there are still two views as there have been since Kant one is this old correspondence
view still has its adherence but i think the view that's coming in more and more is that one cannot
make it a total separation between what's true and what our standards of assertibility are
that the way in which the what i called using the Kantian picture the mind dependence of truth
comes in is the fact that what's true and what's false is in part a function of what our standards
of truth and falsity are and that depends on our interests and and which again change over time
of course that's right i'd like you to say a little more about this question of truth because
this again i think is puzzling to the layman i think that people who are not trained in science
of or philosophy are apt to think that there are a certain set of facts and a true statement is a
statement that accurately describes those facts i'd like you to talk a little about some of the
difficulties that are actually involved in this i think the the biggest difficulty in science itself
comes from the fact that even within one scientific theory you often find different
accounts can be given with so-called facts this came in with the special theory of relativity
when it turned in turned out that facts about simultaneity whether two things happened at
the same time could be described differently by different observers one could say boy scout a
fired a starter's pistol before boy scout b the other could say no boy scout b fired a starter's
pistol before boy scout a and if the distance is sufficiently large so that a light signal
can't travel from one to the other without exceeding the speed of light then it may be both descriptions
are correct both are admissible of course this leads to i mean profound conceptual difficulties
in understanding some modern scientific theories and this prompts the thought that a scientific
theory can be useful and meaningful and can work even if nobody really quite understands what it
means this is the case with quantum mechanics isn't it i mean nobody is really sure what quantum
mechanics actually means and yet it works that's right and again there i want to say one shouldn't
push that too far because i think we don't want to give up our standards of intelligibility
altogether we want to say quantum mechanics works and the very fact that it works means that there's
something fundamentally right about it and with respect to its intelligibility we're willing
to say in part that may be that we have the wrong standards of intelligibility that we have to
change our intuitions but in part there are real paradoxes in the theory and i think that
more work has to be done to really get a satisfactory resolution of these paradoxes
those things are very ticklish now yes i think somebody hearing our discussion and to whom
perhaps some of these ideas are new might find himself thinking well if all this is so how is
it that science works if traditional scientific theories are breaking down if science is turning
out not to be a body of reliable permanent firm objective knowledge if a significant proportion
of every scientific theory is subjective anyway in the sense that it's contributed by the human mind
by the observer by the scientist how is it in these circumstances that we can actually build
bridges fly airplanes make rockets go to the moon and actually make all this soft fuzzy changing
partly subjective body of theory work for us it must fit the world in some very basic way in
spite of everything that we've been saying that's true but i think the contrast between being subjective
and fitting the world isn't altogether right i'm not saying that scientific knowledge is subjective
or that anything goes and say when the difficult position that we often are in in life of thinking
there is a difference between good and bad reasoning but we don't have a mechanical rule
in everyday life we use interest loaded terms we wouldn't say that there's a policeman on the corner
if we didn't have a whole network of social institutions somebody coming from a primitive
tribe which didn't have policemen might say there's a man in blue on the corner but the fact
that the notion of a policeman is shaped by our interest doesn't mean that it can't be objectively
true that there's a policeman on the corner also i think science works precisely because of this
corageability in large part as professor poppers pointed out the difference between science and
previous ways of trying to find out truth is in large part that scientists are willing to test
their ideas because they don't regard them as infallible in a way that was known at the beginning
and then in the success of Newtonian science somewhat forgotten and we've had to be reminded
again of what Bacon knew that you have to put questions to nature and be willing to change
your ideas if they don't work in some respects the traditional opposition between science and
religion has the two parties of cross places haven't they i mean many religious people now
believe they have certain knowledge about the world that it was created by a god that he made us
in his own image gave us immortal souls which will survive our death and so on certain very
fundamental propositions which they hold with absolute certainty and it's the scientist who
believes that everything is fallible that the world is a mysterious place that we'll never get to
the end of the mystery of and so on and so forth isn't there something in that it may be you say
it may be yes i'm not sure i'm not sure well let's not pursue that but one point i do want to take
up with you leaving even religion aside is that now that science is seen in this entirely different
way that you've been describing by virtually all scientists doesn't it mean that the difference
between science and non-science isn't what it was always thought of as being in other words
since science is so subjective indefinite changing and so on it's no longer a clearly cut and different
kind of human activity or kind of human knowledge from other sorts of human knowledge and other
sorts of human activity i think that's both true and culturally very important i think the harm
that the old picture of science does is that if there is this realm of absolute fact that scientists
are gradually accumulating then everything else appears somehow as non-knowledge something to
which even words like true and false can't properly apply i think that the so-called fact value
dichotomy is a very good example of this it's hard to have a discussion on politics for example
without someone very quickly saying at least in my country uh is that a factor of value judgment
as though it can't be a fact that hipler was a bad man for example or a fact that fairer
faucet majors is a beautiful woman and do you think that it is a fact that Hitler was a bad man
oh yes i do i do too but then if this is so if we are abandoning so many of these comfortable
clear cut distinctions of the past what's the point of continuing to use the category or the
notion or the term science anyway i mean does it any longer clearly demarcate something differentiable
from everything else i don't think it does i think that you know if you're going to distinguish
science from non-science that makes a lot of sense if you still have this old view that there's this
inductive method what makes something science is that it uses it and uses it pretty consciously
and pretty deliberately and that what makes something known science is either it uses it
entirely unconsciously as in learning how to cook you're not consciously thinking about inductive
logic or perhaps does use it at all as metaphysics was alleged not to use it at all i think unfairly
but once you say but both say that there's a sharp line between say practical knowledge
and science and to say that the method which is supposed to draw this line is rather fuzzy
something that we can't state exactly and attempts to state it by the way have been
very much a failure still inductive logic cannot be say programmed on a computer the way deductive
logic can be programmed on a computer i think the development of deductive logic in the last
hundred years and the development of the computer have really brought home very dramatically just
what a different state we are in with respect to proof in the mathematical sciences which we can
state rigorous canons for and proof in what used to be called the inductive sciences where we can
state general maxims but you really have to use intuition general know-how and so on in applying
them one of the two categories that you described the old-fashioned way of looking at science in
terms of was that there was a particular scientific method that you observed the facts and on the
basis of these observed instances you generalized to form scientific theories which you then verified
by experiment so that was the old view wasn't it now that that has been abandoned is there any
longer any single method which is thought of as being scientific method i don't think there should
be people talk of scientific method as a sort of fiction but i think that even in physics where you
do get experiments and tests which pretty much fit the textbooks there's a great deal that does
and then a great deal that shouldn't and i think in fact in the culture i don't really believe there's
an agreement on what's a science or what isn't any university will tell you in its catalog that
there are things called social sciences not sociology of the science or the economics of the
science i bet if you ask anyone in the physics department whether sociology is a science you'll
say no and why will he say no that's interesting i think the real reason is not that the sociologists
don't use the inductive method they probably use it more conscientiously poor things than the physicists
do i think it's because they're not as successful see in other words science has become almost a
name for successful pursuit of knowledge that's right yeah yeah well now i think you've given a
very very good description of the way in which this age-old view of what science was has broken
down in our century and been replaced by something much more fluid and perhaps much more difficult
to get hold of but you have i think described it very clearly can we now come against this background
to what philosophers of science are actually doing you are a philosopher of science what do
you and your colleagues do well part of what we do which i won't try to describe on this broadcast
is fairly technical investigation of specific scientific theories we look at quantum mechanics
very closely we look at both to learn what lessons we can for it from it for philosophy
and to see what contributions we can make as philosophers to clarifying its foundations we
look at relativity theory very closely we look at darwinian evolution very closely and so on
this is the part of philosophy of science that provides the data for the rest but much philosophy
of science is leads shades over into general philosophy and i think it's the best way to
describe it is in terms of what we've been talking about that is each of the issues we've been talking
about divides philosophers of science the issue there are philosophers of science who have a
correspondence view of truth and try to show this can be made precise the answers can the objections
can be overcome you can still view science somehow in the old way and there are others who try to
sketch what another view of truth would come to there are philosophers who still think there is
an inductive method that can be rigorously stated and who work on inductive logic and by the way
i think it's important that there should be because we won't make progress to trying to state
the inductive method if there aren't and that there are others who view the development of science
more culturally more historically and that people like myself who have a sort of in between position
that there's something to the notion of a scientific method there are clear examples
but that it's more or less a continuum that you you mustn't think of it as a kind of
mechanical rule an algorithm that you can apply to get scientific knowledge so that i'd say each
of these issues the nature of truth the nature of the scientific method whether there's any
necessary truth in science anything conceptual contribution which is permanent and can't be
subject to revision is a big question and who are you plural doing all this work for
i have i asked that i don't ask that in a in an irreverent way but what i have in mind is this
i've myself taken part in attempts to bring scientists and philosophers together for discussions
of precisely the issues that you've raised and these attempts have usually failed and failed for
the same reason namely that the scientists lose interest they go back to their laboratories and
get on with doing more science and the great bulk of working scientists it seems to me don't in fact
take very much of an interest in the issues that you've been talking about i think it's conspicuous
that the greatest of all scientists are exceptions i mean they the really blockbusting the path
breaking scientists who've actually made the revolution in this century that you've been
talking about people like einstein max plank niels borne max borne schrodinger uh de broglie
these people were enormously interested in the conceptual questions that you've raised but these
were the the pioneering geniuses and the great mass of thousands of scientists who follow on
behind them and put their work uh to its practical application they don't seem to care so who is
listening to you who is reading the stuff that you publish well i'd say first of all i think we
are basically writing for the philosophically interested layman for the reader of philosophy
i don't view philosophy of science as giving direct advice to scientists just as i think
moral philosophers are ill advised to think that they're giving at least immediately current
contemporary advice on how to live your life or what bills to pass in parliament on the other
hand i do think that scientists tend to know the philosophy of science of 50 years ago and
perhaps this is the bad thing that is perhaps this time lag this culture lag has some value in
weeding out what they shouldn't pay attention to i mean it's annoying to a philosopher to encounter
a scientist who's both sure that he didn't listen to any philosophy of science and then who produces
verbatim ideas which you can recognize is coming from what was popular in 1928 and is there a direct
parallel here between what you're saying about scientists and the economist canes's famous remark
that nearly all businessmen who thought that they were indifferent to airy fairy economic theory were
in fact the slaves of the economic theorists of yesterday of a previous generation that's exactly
true i suppose another parallel one could make would be to say that the account that ordinary
language users give of language and their use of language would be extremely unsophisticated
simply because they take it for granted and never thought about it that too would probably
apply to the account that most scientists would give of what they were doing when they were doing
their science that's right that is it's a mistake to think that merely because when
practice is an activity one can give a theory of it one criticism that's often been made about
philosophers of science is that although they talk of science in this general way what they're
nearly always referring to in fact is is one science namely physics now it's true isn't it that the
science in which the most exciting developments have probably taken place in the last 20 years
anyway has been not physics but biology our philosophers of science open genuinely up into
the criticism of being too physics based in their view of science and having ignored biology too much
i think i would defend us against that on the grounds that i don't although the theories in biology
are of great scientific importance darwin's theory of evolution quick watson on dna and so on
they don't by and large pose big methodological problems of a kind that don't arise in physical
science i'm not sure whether you're going to agree with that well i mean you you you you mentioned
mentioned the word evolution just now and it seems to me that here is a concept
which originated in one of the sciences namely biology and which over a comparatively short
period of time has spread throughout the whole of our culture so that the way almost everybody
thinks is influenced by the notion of evolution not only about the origins of man but about
institutions or the arts all kinds of other things i mean evolution has become a dimension
of western man's thinking about almost anything is that not so that's right and perhaps there has
not been enough attention to this theory though what strikes me as interesting is that the possibility
of explanations of what we think of as the biological kind explanations in terms of function
rather than in terms of the building you know physics and chemistry what you're made of have
come under more attention recently as a result of computer science
and now this this is very this does raise something i'm particularly interested in
when you talk of computer science and that is the interaction between our technology in the case of
computers and philosophy not just science and philosophy but technology and philosophy i mean
computers were originally constructed on the basis of a self-conscious analogy with the human mind
weren't they but as they became more and more sophisticated we began to learn things from them
about the human mind so our construction of computers and what they then tell us about ourselves
seems to actually proceed by interactive growth isn't that so that's right and today
the this is one area by the way in which philosophers are in close contact with scientists
that is the fields of linguistics cognitive psychology computer science philosophy of language
today interact constantly people send papers to one another not because someone tells them to
there are conferences at which specialists in these field meet together again not because someone
decided there should be some cross fertilization the interesting thing about the computer case
if i can stick with it for a moment is one might have thought that the computer the rise of the
computer would encourage a certain kind of vulgar materialism the idea so after all we are machines
so after all everything about us can be explained in terms of physics and chemistry paradoxically
the real effect of the computer on psychology and on philosophy of mind has been a decrease in that
kind of reductionism see the thing about the computer is that when you work with computers
you very rarely have to think about their physics and chemistry there's a distinction that people
draw between their software meaning their program their instructions their rules the way they do
things and their hardware and generally you ignore their hardware you talk about computers at the
software level and you wouldn't really be able to explain what they do in a way that would be of
any use to anyone in terms of the hardware level you explore the there is a kind of emergence
here although it's not a mystical kind of emergence it's not that they're violating the laws of physics
it's just that the the level of work at higher level facts about organization have a kind of
autonomy you'd say this the fact that it's following this program explains why it does this
and i don't need to know how it's built i only need to know it can be built in such a way that
it will follow this program this is a return to a view and if you apply this to the mind it suggests
the return to a view of the mind that i associate with Aristotle there's the view that we are not
ghosts in a machine not spirits which only temporarily embodies but that the relation
between the mind and the body is a relation of function to what has that function Aristotle said
if you use the word soul in connection with an ax and of course he said you don't you'd say the
soul of an ax is cutting and he said the soul of the eye is seeing and he thought of man as a thing
that thinks you're talking now of the alternative to materialism and i say a religious view that
this gives us puts me in mind instantly of the most significant of all the materialist
philosophers in the modern world namely Marxism which after all is the official state philosophy
of about a third of mankind as we sit here discussing this Marxism claims to be scientific
and this is a very important thing about it is there a significant Marxist contribution to the
philosophy of science i don't think there's a significant Marxist contribution but i don't
think that the Marxists were all wrong either i think Engels was one of the most scientifically
learned men of his century he had a he got a number of things wrong but he had an immense
general scientific knowledge and anti-during his big book on philosophy of science although it contains
some rather strange ideas some of which he gets from Hegel by the way is on the whole a sensible
book on philosophy of science among other things on the other hand it's not specifically Marxist
i say that Engels views in philosophy of science are in large part influenced by the standard
philosophy of science of the time they're fairly sophisticated inductive account and what about
subsequent Marxist thinkers who also had some pretension to be philosophers like Lenin for example
well i think they're uneven Lenin i think is on the whole one of the worst he says for example
that theories are copies of motion i mean there you have the copy theory of science just copying
off the reality in its crudest view Mao is more sophisticated and Mao is very influenced by John
Dewey who was widely read in China in the 1920s do you think it's actually made a contribution
to the subject as it is today or not really i think that it anticipated it perhaps might have
made a contribution if people had been less ideologically divided because i think non-Marxist
could have learned the Marxists were among the first people to try to somehow combine a realist
view with the with a stress on practice with a stress on corrigibility and they were very hostile
to the notion of a priori truth and today many mainline philosophers of science are very hostile
to a priori truth as it is they play somewhat the role in philosophy of science i think that
Cain said they play in economics he described Marx as one of his sort of underground predecessors
yes yes when i was introducing this program i mentioned not only the philosophy of science but
also the philosophy of mathematics and before we close i would like like us to say something about
that anyway um i suppose one can really say that the central problem in the philosophy of
mathematics is a direct parallel to the central problem in the philosophy of science namely
how does it fit the world with science it's how does science fit the world in mathematics it's how
does mathematics fit the world is that right that's right and it's even worse because if you're trying
to defend a copy view a correspondence view of truth and empirical science you can answer the
question well how do we build up this picture in such a way that corresponds by saying we have
sense organs as i mentioned before that's not a total answer because there's a tremendous amount
of interpretation involved in simple seeing and simple hearing but if you are if you're talking
about numbers and sets and someone says okay if mathematical knowledge is simply some kind of
a copy of the way numbers are and the way sets are and the way other abstract objects that
mathematician study are the question then what sense enables us to see how they are what is a
number what yes yes a deeply problematic question but still an important one that's right and on
the other hand i don't want to say that the anti-correspondence view has it very easy either
it seems to me that mathematical knowledge is a real puzzle and i think that philosophers
should concentrate more on philosophy of mathematics than they do now because it seems
to be an area where no theory works very well isn't there another very important parallel
between mathematics and science i mean throughout the history of science one of the conflicts has
been between one camp who thought that it was all about objects in the world which existed independent
of human experience and another camp which thought no it's human beings and observers who actually
contribute most of this and as you pointed out much earlier our discussion the truth is almost
certainly a combination of both there is a a long-standing dispute in mathematics isn't there
between one body of people who think that mathematical knowledge is something that so to speak inherent
in the structure of the world and we derive it from the world by experience and observation
and another body of mathematical thought that says no no no mathematics is a creation of the human
mind which we then try to try to impose on reality like a grid as it were on a landscape
isn't that so that's right the latter story is attractive because of the sense organ problem
but it doesn't seem to work either because it it seems that we're not free to impose any mathematics
or any logic we want almost anyone would admit that at least you have to be consistent and what's
consistent and what isn't isn't somehow something we can just make up or decide as when we try to
stress conventionalist accounts subjective accounts we come up against the objectivity of
mathematics we try to stress the objectivity of mathematics we come up against another set of
problems i think we can learn a lot more than we now know about human knowledge and about scientific
knowledge by going further into this area talking of of where we're getting from where we are set
to speak i think the most interesting way in which you could end this discussion professor
putnam would be by talking about what you regard as the most interesting problem areas of the moment
and therefore i take it the most likely growth areas for the immediate future in both of the
subjects we've been discussing philosophy of science and philosophy of mathematics okay i think
that if i'm allowed to confine my prediction of the immediate future because we know that
long-run predictions are always false but in the immediate future i would expect philosophy
of mathematics to be a growth area and philosophy of logic i would expect philosophy of physics i
think to decline somewhat from its central place in philosophy of science although i think they're
part of it touches philosophy of logic the question the astounding suggestion has actually come
forward in connection with quantum mechanics that we may have to change our logic our view of what
the true logical laws are in order to really understand how the world can be quantum mechanical
i think this side of philosophy of quantum mechanics that touches philosophy of logic
will be a hot discussion area but more generally i think areas which we almost don't think of
as philosophy of science that become philosophy of language and philosophy of mind like these
questions about computer models of the mind computer models of language and these more general
questions about theories of truth the nature of truth the nature of verification how science can
be objective even though there's not a rigorous scientific method that i think these questions
will continue to be the staples of the field one thing that worries me about this whole area
is is its relationship to the educated layman i mean who in a sense is the person our discussion
has been for after all it's now over 70 years since the 25 year old einstein published the theory
of relativity and i'm sure you'll agree with me that it's true to say now
that the great majority of educated people with higher educations university degrees and so
still have scarcely any idea of what this is all about and it's done very little to actually influence
their view of the world isn't there a danger that now science and mathematics are simply
racing ahead and the whole new range and world of insight that that is giving us into the universe
in which we live simply isn't filtering through to the non-specialist or not filtering through
anything like fast enough that is a danger but it's one that something can be done about
there's now for example a text of special relativity called spacetime physics which
is designed for the first month of the first freshman college physics course and the authors
say at the beginning that they look forward to the time when it will be taught in high schools
and do you think that time will in fact come and quite soon i'm sure of it yes well i i think
you're right and indeed i hope you are thank you very much professor puttman thank you
