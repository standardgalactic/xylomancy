During World War II the Pentagon hired behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner to launch a series of experiments called project pigeon
The first rule for teaching anything is to structure the situation so that the behavior is likely to occur
The military wanted him to create pigeon guided missiles
So he built these boxes where he would put pigeons and there would be signs and the signs
The pigeons would have to hit and when they hit those then eventually food would come out
You might define reading as the ability to emit an appropriate differential response to written commands
Actually pigeons are capable of good pattern discrimination
And what he could demonstrate is very quickly this stimulus and reward system would feed the pigeons and they would learn even these
Stupid creatures could learn exactly what they needed to do to survive. Well, that's exactly the structure
We've built for Congress
Shaping consists of reinforcing closer and closer approximations of the response we wish to condition
Sometimes we use the nudge or a kick under the table
Just like the pigeons in the Skinner box experiments learned which buttons they needed to push to get the sustenance
They needed to eat so to Congress people learn which buttons they need to push to get the sustenance
Their campaigns need to survive and what politicians need most to survive is money to fuel their next campaign
This Congress in the United States
Spends anywhere between 30 and 70 percent of its time raising campaign money
But it doesn't raise money from the average American it raises money from a tiny tiny fraction of the 1%
They have become conditioned reinforcers and they can exert a great deal of control over behavior
And if that tiny fraction objects to anything Congress might want to do it's extraordinarily hard to get Congress to do it
Our subjects are available when we need them
So when any major issue like gun safety legislation or health care reform or the minimum wage comes up
The question is whether these funders
Oppose it or not and if they oppose it, it's not gonna happen. The presentation of an aversive stimulus is called punishment
It's simple. He who pays the piper calls the tune
How did we get here?
To a system with a rich and powerful steer our government into serving them instead of the people who elected it
To answer that we have to go back to the 1970s
The Vietnam War is raging and there are protests in the streets
There's also a rising movement of consumer protection the abuses are flagrant hot dogs made of substandard meat
Toothpastes that don't prevent cavities Ralph Nader is taking on the big car companies
Saying that they're making unsafe cars and they're profiting at the expense of people's safety
And there is a rising environmental movement the public begins to demand their representatives and government fix the problems and
government responds
President Nixon creates the EPA
Congress passes the clean air and water acts and other governmental agencies step in to begin imposing new health and safety regulations on big business
So you're beginning to get a great pushback and the corporate captains
Who have been making tons of money and feeling like they sort of rule society?
Are thrown back on their heels
Enter Lewis F. Powell
So Lewis Powell was kind of a big deal Virginia lawyer
represented big corporations, especially big tobacco
in 1971
There's a paper written by Lewis Powell who would later be a Supreme Court justice and he warns corporate America
You better fight back because you're gonna lose your place in society
The confidential paper becomes known as the Powell memo even to this day
I find that people are amazed when they hear about it because it is like a document that would exist in a fictional account
Powell argues that corporate America is under an unprecedented attack and is losing its grip on the levers of power
The memo presents a detailed battle plan for how to secretly get it back
Everybody from Ralph Nader to Ho Chi Minh were freaking him and his circle out like oh my god. What's happening?
He basically said look if we don't organize to defend business
Against populist regulation America as we know it is going to disappear
Powell warns that the right needs to launch a shadow campaign to influence academia
Sway the courts and fight back against liberal voices in the media
It's like this call to arms of corporate America
For much of the 70s the public sees elected officials as something like their lawyer
The place to go to get a local river cleaned up or an unsafe car recalled
There is padding here
Presumably might reduce the possibility of getting your teeth broken if you hit it
But for Powell's memo to work that needs to change and by 1980
That relationship between the public and their government will come under attack
Skyrocketing inflation and slow growth produce a new phenomenon in America. They call it stagflation
Millions are struggling more than they've had to in a generation
And suddenly a lot of Americans are receptive to the idea that big government is to blame
All of this sets the stage for a presidential candidate who will echo Powell's call to arms
And then he took another crack at the American people and said that we had inflation because you and I were living too well
You and I living too well is not the cause of inflation
We have inflation because government is living too well
