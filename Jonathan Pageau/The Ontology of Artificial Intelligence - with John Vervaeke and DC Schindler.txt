This was my greatest fear that we would hack our way into this,
which would mean it would be like almost like,
even worse than the A-bomb,
we would be releasing this power on the world
into corporations and states and military organizations
who ultimately don't have a deep understanding
beyond the engineering of what ontologically is going on.
This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the Symbolic World.
All right, so this discussion is going to be oriented towards AI generally
and the large language models.
I take there to be a distinction there.
Maybe, John, you can talk about that a little bit as we get going here.
But just to position ourselves generally at the outset,
context for this conversation will be John's video essay about AI.
This came out nine months ago, ten months ago now.
I think it came out last April or something.
Yeah.
So almost, yeah, ten months ago, I think.
OK, OK, perfect.
Which is great because it gave evidence for my claim
that many of the predictions were premature.
Perfect, yeah.
Yeah, so in order to sort of set the framing here,
we'll start off with John sharing a little bit,
sort of an overview of what the arguments in that essay were.
And then we'll move to Jonathan if you want to sort of position yourself
in relation to AI generally and then John's essay in particular.
And then same for David.
And then from there, we can just sort of get going and see what comes out.
We do have a bit of an extended time here.
So I would hope that we can be free if the logo's catches
and we want to move in a slightly different direction
that we would be at liberty to follow that.
That would be great.
If all of it centers around AI, that's great.
But yeah, excited to be here.
This has been a long time in coming.
I think it took us, I don't know, four or five months to get this together.
So I'm very happy to be here with all of you and see you all.
It's great to see you too, Ken.
Should I start then?
Yeah, go for it.
OK, so AI, of course, artificial intelligence,
a project actually proposed in the Scientific Revolution by Thomas Hobbes.
So it's an old idea,
but I want to make use of a distinction
made by John Searle between weak AI and strong AI.
Weak AI is when we make machines
that do things that used to be done by human beings.
So if you're back in the 1930s, computers were human beings.
You sent you needed computation done.
You sent it down to the third floor where all the computers were
and they were human beings and they had machines and flight rules and things like that.
And of course, they have been replaced
or your bank teller has been replaced by the ATM.
That's called weak AI because it is not claimed
that that AI gives us any scientific insight into the nature of intelligence.
It's just we put together a machine.
It took great intelligence and I'm not demeaning people that do this.
It's a it's a valuable in our lives or depending on weak AI.
Right now, we wouldn't be talking without it.
So I'm not here besmirching that and anything like that.
But nobody is claiming that when they're making that machine.
Well, now we understand, right, what cognition is or something like that.
And strong AI is Hobbes's proposal that cognition is computation.
And that what we can do is if we make the right kind of computer
understood abstractly, we won't.
We will have created an instance of genuine intelligence.
So it's it's not a claim of simulation.
It's a claim of instantiation.
Now, in between weak and strong AI,
it's something that's trying to move from weak AI to strong AI.
And this is known as AGI, artificial general intelligence.
And this is the idea that our intelligence is different
from the intelligence of the ATM in that we have general intelligence.
We can solve multiple problems and multiple domains for multiple reasons
and multiple contexts and yadda, yadda, yadda, you can just do the multiples,
which makes us tremendously different from those machines.
And the project is can we get
artificial intelligence to be artificial general intelligence
because that will have moved the needle considerably towards strong AI.
Because it will become increasingly difficult to say it doesn't have this.
Sorry, this is the argument.
It will become increasingly difficult for us to say
it doesn't have the same kind of intelligence as Ken does.
If it can solve a wide variety of problems
and a wide variety of domains for a wide variety of goals, etc., etc.
That's the basic argument.
Whether or not AGI is clearly necessary for strong artificial intelligence,
whether it's sufficient is part of what's actually being debated.
Not very well, I would say in general right now, but that's what's going on.
OK, first of all, any questions just about these distinctions?
Because a lot of the discussion out there doesn't make these claims distinctions.
And so it's fuzzy.
It's confused. It's equivocal.
And so a lot of it should be ignored
because it's not helpful. Yes.
I have one question.
So this cognition equals computation.
If we accomplish AGI in the way that you're talking about,
we would not necessarily be affirming that cognition equals computation
if I'm hearing you right. Is that right?
So that's an interesting question.
And that gets down to a couple more finer points.
I'll go in detail a little bit later.
Well, just to address it, many people think that
because of the work of Jeff Hinton, who is basically the godfather
of the machines that are emerging right now, that genuine AGI
will not be computational in the sense that Hobbes and Descartes meant.
Cognition is not going to be completely explainable
in terms of formal systems that are the inferential manipulations
of representational propositions, etc., like that.
And but that was Hobbes's proposal.
And that has been the dominant view until about the 80s.
And then we got neural networks and then we had dynamical systems.
Right now, I'm not distinguishing between them
because I don't want to get too much into the technical weeds.
If it becomes relevant, you let me know and I'll pull those out.
So the thing about Hobbes is Descartes sort of criticizes Hobbes.
He actually has contempt for Hobbes.
He's a contemporary and he basically poses a bunch of problems
that the scientific revolution says would make it impossible
for computation to be cognition.
One is the scientific revolution says matter is inert and it's purposeless.
But of course, cognition is dynamic and it has to act on purpose.
Cognition works in terms of meaning.
And the scientific revolution has said there's no meaning in things,
material things, so how could you get meaning out of it?
The scientific revolution said all those secondary qualia,
the sweetness of the orange, the beauty of the sunset.
It's not in those things.
It's in your mind.
So how could you possibly get meaning out of matter?
And Descartes's point is, well, a rational being is seeking the truth.
And truth depends on an understanding of meaning.
And therefore, so I want you to understand that Descartes arguments
against Hobbes, although he may have been motivated by his Catholicism,
they do not depend on the Catholicism.
They depend on the very scientific worldview that right.
So there's a tension here about AI and the scientific worldview.
So here's another way of thinking about the strong project would is the project
that is attempting to show how Hobbes is right with an explanation
that is strong enough to refute Descartes challenges.
That's how and I think anything less than that standard
is not true to the history of the project.
And so that's the standard I hold strong AI to.
Now, AGI isn't quite shooting at that standard.
That's why I put it a little bit more intermediary.
Does that is that OK? Yeah. All right.
Now, sorry, I had to do a bit of background there,
because I wanted to get clear about a lot of things that are talked about
in a very murky and confused fashion in the in the general media.
And they're just they're just confused.
And so they they're they're they're confusing.
So I proposed to take a look at the LLMs where it is claimed.
They're not even it's not even claimed that they're full AGI, right?
Of course, some people claimed immediately they were strong AI.
The more the people closer to the technology didn't said it might be AGI.
The MIT review said it sparks.
There are some sparks of AGI.
So let's be very clear how the reflection was actually holding these machines.
So these LLMs like chat GDP.
And so what I did in my essay is I wanted to review the scientific
import and impact, the philosophical import and impact
and the spiritual import and impact.
Now, I won't do the arguments in great detail, but
here's the scientific import.
These machines do not give us any understanding of the nature of intelligence.
And to my mind, that was one of my great fears.
I was hoping that cognitive science would advance.
So we got a significant, significant understanding of intelligence before AGI emerged.
This machine does not give us any any advanced, you know, well, what's intelligence?
The machine gives us no good scientific theory of it.
It does not have AGI in a measurable sense.
So if I asked Jonathan to do a math test and I asked him to do a reading comprehension test,
his scores will be very predictive of each each other.
This is what spearmen discovered way back when in the 20s.
That's what artificial general and intelligence is.
This is not the case for these machines.
They can score in the top 10th percentile for the Harvard Law exam
and they can't write a good grade 11 philosophy essay or something like that.
So they don't have AGI.
The way they get their intelligence is it would not give any explanation
of how any non-linguistic creature is intelligent, like a chimpanzee, etc.
So and I think this goes to the deeper issue is that they don't really explain
what I think is at the heart of general intelligence, predictive processing
and relevance realization.
They just piggyback on our capacities for that.
And they piggyback and they mechanize it and not only our individual capacity,
but are the collective intelligence of our distributed cognition.
They're piggybacking and all of that.
Now, that does not mean they are weak machines.
They're very powerful machines.
But here's the problem.
They are very powerful machines that have not gendered,
have not engendered any corresponding compensatory scientific understanding.
This is my greatest fear that we would hack our way into this,
which would mean it would be like almost like even worse than the A-bomb.
We would be releasing this power on the world into corporations and states
and military organizations who ultimately don't have a deep understanding
beyond the engineering of what ontologically is going on.
So that's the scientific argument.
Now, for those who said that was very like go watch the essay.
I give the essay in more detail.
The philosophical argument has to do with rationality.
We have overwhelming evidence that making you intelligent is necessary,
but not sufficient for making you rational.
In fact, I gave a talk on this for the center of AI and ethics
way before the LLMs came online and because rationality is a higher order.
Rationality is how you deal with the inevitable self-deception
that emerges when you're using your general intelligence.
And all of you know that I have arguments for why that's the case.
Relevance realization, predictive processing, etc.
Now that requires a reflective capacity, something like metacognition,
something like working memory, maybe something like consciousness.
It requires that you care about the truth, that you have a sense of agency.
You want to correct self-deception because you don't want your agency undermined.
And I argued that what we're doing is we're making machines
that are going to be highly intelligent and highly irrational.
And that's what we have. They confabulate, they lie, they hallucinate,
and they don't care that they're doing any of these things,
which is part of what's called the alignment problem,
which is how do we get them to align this power with our concerns?
For me, the spiritual import is we have powerful ignorance
about a powerful intelligence that is merely a pantomime of genuine intelligence
being unleashed in the world and wrecking havoc.
And it's going to have a huge impact.
And, of course, we'll probably differ in the details about this.
But this is what I meant when I said, I argued at the end,
and also when I was talking to Jordan Hall about this,
that theology will become a central thing again
because human beings' relationship to the ultimate
is going to become one of the defining differences.
These machines are not embodied, so they won't have
all of the soulful aspects of our existence that come from the,
like the ineffable aspects of our embodiment.
And their capacity for self-transcendence is going to be extremely limited.
And so the ineffable aspects of our existence,
because we come into reality, we come into relationship
to what's mysterious and ultimate, will ultimately be more and more emphasized.
Why? These two poles and what connects them,
and Jonathan's happy that I'm doing that, I imagine,
are have ineffability at the poles, ineffability throughout.
And that way, they are outside our capacity to put into propositions
so that they can be put into these machines.
And so people, I'm predicting that people are going to increasingly need to,
one way is they'll just give in and become cyborgs.
But the other is that they want to try and preserve their humanity.
The spiritual dimensions of our humanity are going to become anchors for people.
So now, one last overall arching point, and then I'll shut up.
I hope this is two overarching points.
One is I didn't make predictions.
Because all these graphs that came out, the univariate,
single variable predictions about something that's a multivariate phenomena,
it's exponential.
The human beings are bad at making exponential predict.
They were ridiculous.
And so I think both the, oh, we're heading to Utopia and the others,
we're going to be all extinct within a year.
I said, this is ridiculous.
Put that aside.
Instead, what I've talked about is thresholds.
Thresholds are points where we will have to make decisions.
So for example, as we empower these machines, we will face the decision.
Do we want to make them more rational?
Do we want to make them more self-correcting, genuinely self-correcting?
Well, that means we've got to give them caring, some kind of reflective awareness.
And I think for arguments I've given elsewhere,
that means they have to be auto-poetic.
They have to be living in a sense of self-making.
I don't think, I'll just say it as a sentence right now,
I don't think there's artificial intelligence without artificial life.
Now, those projects are going on right now.
But, and when we come to the decision, right, we can say, no, we won't give them that
because embodying them and giving them these extra capacities is going to be wickedly expensive.
You know, the amount of energy to do an LLM is like the energy for running Toronto for two weeks.
And so we may say we don't do that, but then we face the issue of this increasingly,
right, you know, I call it like a, like, sort of like a parody or a pantomime of
intelligence being released on the world that is not got any significant self-correct.
So that's a decision point.
The problem is if we give them, if we try to give them rationality,
then we have to face the consequences.
And they're going to go from energetic and economic up to ethical and etc.
These machines, they'll have to be machines, not individuals.
And this has to do with technicalities about bias and variance trade-offs.
And so you get into the Hegelian thing that these machines are going to have to reciprocally recognize
each other in order to generate the norms of self-correction.
And then they're going to have to be cultural beings.
Hegel's arguments, I think, are just devastatingly on mark here.
And so that's a decision point for us.
And then that's all bound up with the overall worry about alignment.
As these machines become more powerful, how do we make sure they don't kill us all?
And they may not kill us intentionally, especially if they're just doing that pantomime.
They would just do it because they may just be indifferent to us because they don't,
they're indifferent to everything.
They don't care, which is part of their problem, right?
They don't care about themselves or the information.
And this is the part where I expect all of you will jump off in agreement with me,
but maybe not, maybe there will be a way of modifying it.
I propose that trying to get these machines oriented towards us to solve the alignment
problem is not going to work.
Now, remember, I'm not making a prediction.
We have to make choices through the thresholds.
I'm saying, if we make those choices and we get here,
and the alignment problem then becomes significantly exacerbated,
like if we give these things robotic bodies,
the alignment problem just goes up orders of magnitude, right?
I or I basically said, now what we have to do is we have to orient them, right?
If we genuinely give them the capacity for self-correction,
self-transcendence, and caring, we get them to care as powerfully as they can about what
is true and good and beautiful.
And then they bump up against the fact that no matter how mighty they are,
they are insignificant against the dynamical complexity of reality,
and they would hopefully get a profound kind of epistemic humility.
And then I argue that there are three possibilities.
One is they figure out enlightenment, and then they can help us become enlightened,
because that's what enlightened beings do, and they would have better knowledge of it.
They can't become enlightened, and then we realize something actually
ontologically specifically unique about us, and we get better at cultivating it,
because we'll have an excellent contrast that allows us to arrow in on what it is to be enlightened.
And the third one, which I think is the least probable of the three,
remember I'm not making a prediction, I'm saying what can happen once we get through threshold,
is like in her, they just get enlightened and they just leave, which could also happen.
I doubt that, because we don't have any evidence of enlightened beings behaving
that way, all of our historical evidence, is that their their compassion extends,
and it extends much more broadly, not only to other human beings, other sentient beings,
reality itself, it seems plausible that this would be the case.
And so I advocated, if you'll allow me, and then I'll shut up David, I advocated,
don't align them to us, and if you'll allow me to speak sort of non-theistically,
align them to God, and then don't worry about how they're going to interact with us.
So I'll shut up now for a long time, that's the gist of the essay and the argument and the proposal.
I was just going to make a smart outlet comment that they might ask us to leave,
an additional possibility, but anyway.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Oh, thanks, John, that I mean, I'm amazed that you were able to resume your essay
so well, actually, like I was like, I was going to I was going to resume all of this in
because it was a conversation and it lasted quite a bit.
So I want to bring up a few things that that that I'm thinking about that have been,
let's say, concerning me. I'll start with the more dangerous one. One is a meta problem,
which is that one of the things that I've been suggesting is that what we're noticing,
what we're seeing happening is agency acting on us, and the agency is not bound by the AI
or by the systems, but also is also bound in the motivation to make the AI is happen.
So one of the problems that I'm seeing is that a lot of this is motivated by economic
by greed, by the capacity to be economically superior to other companies. So companies in
their competition with each other are rushing to implement AI to not lose out and to not be last in
line. And because of the fact that these that that this that AI requires such huge amounts of
money and of capital and of investment means that one of the things that I'm worried about is that
in some ways, what is actually driving AI is something like Mammon that it's like it's hiding
Mammon, you know, so the AI is is is an aspect of something bigger, which is actually what is
running through our society. And, you know, you can see that already to me, you can already see
that happening in the social media networks, you know, Facebook and all this, that their desire
to get people's attention in order to simply justify their presence on the on the platform,
so that they can see advertisements, has made us subject to these to these types of
of transpersonal agencies that even the people at Facebook weren't aware of, right? They basically
made a subject to rage and to, you know, to all these very immediate desires just to keep us on
the platform. And so that is the thing that I'm worried about is that there are actually other
things playing with AI that that people think what they're doing is AI, but what they're also
doing is increasing this other type of agency, which is running through, running through our
societies and is subjecting us to it. That's my that's my first worry. And so in some ways, you
know, when I say, you know, that the gods are kind of acting or acting through us, that's what I mean.
I don't just mean the AI itself is going to become a God. What I mean is that, you know, just like
the just like the the the arms race, I can understand it as the like that that say the legs of an
of a of a of an agency that is running through society that nobody can control. It's like a
program running through and that no individual people can control. That's what I'm seeing with
AI. And so I don't say so I think that all the warnings that people have sent up all the all
the like, let's slow down, let's do it this way are not are not reaching anybody because
the the economic part of it is so strong. And everybody realizes that if they don't and even
Elon Musk, right, Elon Musk is saying he was saying it's dangerous is the most dangerous thing in
the world. He's recently said in a conversation with Jordan Peterson that that that, you know,
Chad GPT and open AI is like the single most dangerous thing in the in in the world right now,
the thing that but then then the less he's like, okay, well, then now we need to make rock.
And now we need to do our own AI. So there's that that's the thing that that's one of the big
things that that worry me. That's my my my my big thing. The second one is really more of a
it's more of like a religious or platonic argument in terms of an ontological hierarchy
is that I do not honestly see how it is possible for humans to make something that is not derivative
of themselves. That is not a derivation of their own consciousness. So the idea that these things
could not be either ways to increase certain people's power or parasites on our own consciousness
seems to me not not possible. And this is really because in some ways I believe that there is a
real ontological hierarchy of of agency and that we have a place to play in that. And and I think
the analogy of saying that these things are our children, I think it's a wrong analogy. I don't
think that it is the same. The something which comes out of our nature, which is not which is
not something that we make is different from something that we make. And this is run through
all mythology run through all all, you know, all the the mythological images of the difference
between the technique, you know, the technical gods and all this aspect of what it means to
increase our power. And so I and so that's the second one. And the third big problem is the
idol problem, which I which I mentioned several times is the the idea of making a god for yourself,
which is related to technology. And it's a danger that I see happening already,
which is the tendency of humans to take the things they make. And to let they worship the
things that they that they make and to think that those things are are more powerful and that
that hides something else, right? So if you think take my three basic problems that I see is that
the tendency of humans to want to worship AI or to put AI above them is actually a kind of
it's a it's running the first problem. It's that what they're ended up what they're doing is they're
giving power to the corporations and to the people that are going to rule AI and without
knowing it. So what they what they wanted and even maybe nobody knows what they're doing, but
the the the desire to like I'll give a simple example that happened recently to my daughter,
my daughter, I think I mentioned this to all of you, but my daughter got an email from the schools
from the the Quebec government, they didn't send it to the parents, send it to the students,
asking the students. It was like a survey asking them if they would be willing to have AI counselors
where they to whom they could tell their problems and because the AI counselor doesn't have
prejudice, right? It doesn't have human prejudice. It doesn't have all the biases or whatever.
What I mean is that this happened like six months ago. So immediately, you know, the people in power
thinking of placing the AI above us like right away. It's that weird thing. It's that that making
a God for yourself problem. But like I said, like in the image in Revelation, which is a great image,
which is, you know, you make an image of the beast, but then there's someone else animating it.
And that's what I'm worried about is that there will have these AI things that are running us,
but they will be derivative of us. And they'll ultimately derivative of the people that are
very, very powerful because they'll be the ones that have the the money and the power to control
them. So those are the three problems that I have that I'm worried about. I'd like to
respond to each one of those in turn. I think those are really important. And the first one
is just to note, I agree with you. First of all, putting it in terms of agency is what it needs
to be done. People who have tried to dismiss these machines as mere tools or technology,
like all the others, are not getting what kind of entities these machines are. I agree with you
that there are Milwaukee enforces at work. And I talk about this. And I think to enhance your point,
these machines are built out of distributed cognition and collective intelligence. And therefore,
that your point is strengthened by that very fact. Now, I do think two things come out of this.
One is I want to challenge you on that. Nobody's listening. I have people working inside these
corporations, literally helping to make these machines who are listening to me and I'm trying
to get other people inside to get get involved with the wise AI project. I'm not claiming I'm
going to win or any ridiculousness, but I don't think it's fair to say to the people who are
listening that no one is listening. There are a lot of people listening and and they're talented
people and they're putting in their time and the talent and their powers of persuasion to try and
make a difference. It is possible. I grant to you it's not a high, it's not like a 70% probability,
but I think it's some significantly greater than zero probability that we could continue this process
and reach people in a way that could make a difference. I agree with you and I think I said
right initially a lot of people hammered me for it. This thing is like the atomic bomb.
And one of the problems we had is we we rushed the technology before we unpacked all of the science
and all of the wisdom. We had people standing and watching the explosion because we didn't
understand the radiation. So I agree with all of that, but I do want to
I'm not claiming anything other than rational hope. There are people listening and there are people
working on literally on the insides. I can't say who they are for obvious reasons.
And so that is happening. And so while I agree with you and I even agree with you probabilistically,
I feel morally compelled to try and make this happen as much as I can.
So now I think there is another reason for hope. See, these machines have always depended on us as
a template, a Turing-like template that we compare the machines to us. And what we've been able to
do is rely upon our natural intelligence. You know, you don't have to do much to be intelligent
for your intelligence to develop. You just have to not be brutalized or traumatized,
properly nourished and have human beings around you that talk. And then your intelligence will
unfold. And so all of these people doing these machines and making these data sets, they can
rely on naturally widely distributed intelligence. This is not the case for rationality. And this
is not the case for wisdom. These people, I have no hesitation saying by and large, many of them
are not highly rational. I doubt that many of them are highly wise. And insofar as we need to model,
right, have really good models, if we want to give these machines a comprehensive self-correction,
rationality and caring about the normatives, wisdom, we have to become more rational and
more wise. And that's sort of a roadblock for these people. Now, they can just ignore all of that,
and I suspect they might, and just say, we're not going to try and make these machines rational and
wise. We're going to just go down the road of making these, you know, these pantomimes of
intelligence, and that has all the problems. But if they move towards making them something that
would be, I think, more dangerous, then they run into the fact that there's an obligation to do
things, they and us, we have to become more rational and wise because we need the genuinely
existing models. And secondly, we have to fill the social space, the internet, where all of the
literature, where the data is being drawn with a lot more wisdom and rationality. These are huge
obligations on us. And that sort of gives me hope, because it's like there's a roadblock
for this project going a certain way that requires a significant reorientation towards wisdom
and rationality in order for there to be any success.
Before you get to the third point, I just want to-
I haven't even got to the second point, but go ahead.
Oh, sorry, sorry. I just want to ask you one question based on what you said, is that my
perception of the situation is that there's actually a correlation between the diminishing
in wisdom and the diminishing in wisdom traditions and the desire to do this.
It's like a Sorcerer's Apprentice situation, where the Sorcerer would not have awoken all the
rooms to do it. The little apprentice Mickey doesn't know why to do things or why not to do
things. That's why he's doing it in the first place. Yeah, I agree with that.
It's like our society is moving away from wisdom, and that's one of the reasons why
we're doing this in the first place. And again, I'm not denying that. What I'm saying is,
as we empower these things, their self-deceptive, self-destructive power is also going to go up
exponentially. And we are going to start losing millions of dollars in our investment as they
do really crappy, shitty, unpredicted things. And so there's going to be a strong economic
incentive to bring in capacities for comprehensive, caring self-correction,
and then my argument rolls in. And so that's part of my response. The thing about thinking
of those children, I mean, we do make our kids, we make them biologically, and we make them
culturally. So I don't want to get stuck in this word making. We could be equivocating.
And that's why we were using the term mentoring. The idea there is we have two options for the
alignment. We can either try and program them and hardwire rules into them so that they don't
misbehave, which is going to fail if we move to the, if we cross the threshold and decide we want
to make these machines self-transcending like us. And then what do we do? How do we solve that problem?
Well, the only way, the only machinery we have for solving that is the cultural,
ethical, spiritual machinery of mentoring. That's how we do it with our kids. If we try to,
if we try to just somehow hardwire them for being the kind of agents we want them to be,
we will fail. And I, for me, I guess I'm trying to argue that's the only game in town we have.
We either have programming or we have mentoring. And I understand the risk, but if my answer to the
first question has some validity to it and hopefully some truth, then the answer to the mentoring
becomes more powerful because that means we also have to become the best possible parents,
creating the best possible social discourse. The thing about the idol, I take that very seriously.
And that's what I mean when I said the theology is going to be the important science coming forward
because we should not be trying to make gods. I agree with you. This is problematic. There are
already cults building up around these AGI's. And I warned, and I warned that that would happen
in my essay, right? And I said that, and that's going to keep happening and it's going to get worse.
We hear about it happening in the organizations themselves, which is the,
yes, yes. And the people who are doing wise AI are trying to challenge that.
And so this is why I proposed actually humbling these machines. This is why I call them silicon
sages. I did that deliberately to try and designate that we are not making a god. What we're trying to
do is make beings who are humbled before the true, the good and the beautiful like us and therefore
form community with us rather than being somehow godlike entities that we're worshiping.
I would hope that, like, think about this. We find it easy to conceive that they might discover
depths of physics and they're already discovering things in physics that human beings haven't
discovered and in medicine and stuff like that. Well, why not also in, you know, how human beings
become wiser? And so I guess what I'm saying is I take all of your concerns for real and I've tried
to build in my proposal ways of responding to them. These machines should not be idolized.
I think they should become like, like, I mean, let me give you an example. I have many students
who are now surpassing me. I taught them, I mentored them, and they're surpassing me. And
unless you're a psychopath, that's what you want to happen. And then what they do is they enter
and then they come back and they want to reciprocate. And that's what I'm talking about when I'm
talking about the Silicon Stages. Now, again, is this a high probability? Depends on the thresholds.
Depends about whether or not the first and the second argument work. But I'm still arguing
there's a possibility that they could be Silicon Stages as opposed to being gods.
Because one of the things, like I think in almost all of the wisdom tradition that happens is that
the wise or the enlightened one, if you want to use that, appears as nearly invisible to most
people. So Christ, Sal talks about the seed, the pearl, these little, these things which you cannot,
most people actually do not see that are hidden in reality. And then the sages, we have this
image in the Orthodox tradition, for example, that there are people in the world that hold
up reality by their prayers, but we don't know who they are. They are invisible by that very fact,
because there's something about wisdom which does that. And when a wise person appears too much,
we hate them, we want to kill them, they annoy us, they're thorn in our side. And so this is
another issue is that what you have is these beings that are extremely powerful, like massively
powerful and have a massive reach and have a lot, there are things, the reason why they exist,
like I said, have all this economic drive towards them. The idea that they would become these sages
in the way that we tend to understand wisdom as being, to me, that brings the probability
way down. Because of that, because of what, at least when we understand wisdom to be what it looks
like, it looks very different. It looks like the immobile, meditating sage who gives advice,
but doesn't do much. I want to push back on this, because what's in this is an implicit distinction
between intelligence and a capacity for caring, the capacity for epistemic humility. And I think
when you move from intelligence to rationally, that you can't maintain that you can grow the one
without growing the other. So in fact, this is why intelligence only counts for maybe
30% of the variance in rationality and even less of wisdom. I would put it to you that
if you concede that these machines could get vastly more powerful in terms of intelligent
problem solving, then concede the possibility they could get vastly more powerful than us in
their capacity for caring and caring about the normative and being vastly more powerful in
the capacity for humility as well. And so, and that's kind of what we see with these people,
right? We don't see them just becoming super polymaths, we see them actually demonstrating
profound care, really enhanced relevance realization and profound commitments to reality
that we properly admire and they seem to want to help us as much as they can. And the point is
these people don't just, I think this is your point, they don't just slam into us like epistemic
bulldozers, they are, in fact, one of the things that I was often admired about them, Socrates,
Jesus, the Buddha, is their capacity to adapt and adjust to whoever their interlocutor is.
And again, let's imagine that capacity magnified as well. So what I'm asking is don't, I mean,
first of all, I admit it, if we don't cross a certain threshold, we could just accelerate the
intelligence and not accelerate these other things. But I said there are deep problems in
that that will become economically costly. And then if we imagine that rationality and wisdom
are also being enhanced, then I think this addresses some of your concerns.
Maybe I can stake out my position because it sort of picks up on that. And I've got basically
three points I want to address that the first is precisely picking up there with the distinction
between intelligence and rationality. I might have some issues with the terms,
but I think that distinction is really helpful. And your point that rationality is caring,
is caring, that there is no rationality without caring, that, you know, the platonic notion,
if truth is in some sense caused by the good, then one can't know without in some sense,
caring about the good. Now, as it relates to artificial intelligence, I think I have a serious
problem with that very term, artificial intelligence. And I wouldn't want to concede the word
intelligence for just mind power. It seems to me that intelligence itself has this connection to
caring. And I mean, in the medieval vocabulary, in a way, intellectus is the more profound level
of the mind than Ratio reason. But that's sort of a semantic point. Let me put it in the basic
context that I would want to raise. And this is something I don't hear addressed generally in
the discussions. It seems to me that let me start by just making it the point concretely.
I think that I wonder whether, in fact, it's possible to be intelligent without first being alive.
That there's something about the nature of a living thing that is what allows
intelligence to emerge. And what is that then exactly? Now, a more sort of subtle point that's
related to that, and I think this is really a crucial point, and this is going to be the
thread of my whole set of comments here, is that when we talk about intelligence in machines,
what we mean is intelligent behavior. We're looking to see to what extent we can make machines
act as if they are intelligent, act as if they are conscious. And that's actually profoundly
different from being intelligent. It's a subtle sort of functionalistic substitute for the ontological
reality of knowing if that makes sense. We see what kind of inputs and outputs, what things are
able to do, what they're able to accomplish. And even when we make those questions weighty and
ethical and religious and so forth, we still tend to put them in terms of behavior and
achieving certain things. And I think that that's actually already missing something
really profound, which is that intelligence is in the first place a way of being before it's a way
of acting. And it's analogous to what it means to be alive rather than just carry out functions
that look like life. And if you want to go into the metaphysics behind it, both intelligence
and life are impossible without a kind of unity that precedes difference, that transcends difference
and allows the different parts of a thing to be genuinely intrinsically related to each other.
And then that relates to the question whether you can ever make a thing that's intelligent,
that the ontological conditions for life and therefore intelligence include a kind of
givenness, an already givenness of living things. That's why, I mean, there's a profound
distinction, it seems to me, I mean, this is crucial in the Christian creed between
begetting and making, begotten and not made, living things beget each other and they're passing on a
unity that they already possess. But when you make something, you're putting something together.
And I don't know if you can put something together that can have that genuine unity that allows
it to be alive and allows it to be intelligent in this deeper sense. Okay, so whenever you
functionalize something, you make it replaceable. That's a principle from Robert Speymann. If
something is defined by what it's able to achieve, then you can make something else that can achieve
that thing and it sort of, it becomes a functional substitute. But if you deny, if you say that there's
something deeper than function, you're actually pointing to something that can't be replaced.
Okay, so that's the first set of points. The second one has to do with what Jonathan
called the sort of trans personal agency and that I think is a really serious question.
And the way I would put it is that there's something, so I find that kind of a compelling
point that there's a kind of an inherent logic in this pursuit that makes us more a function of it
than it is a function of us. I mean, that can be described in different ways and there's
certainly a dialectical relationship there. But there is a certain sense in which there's a kind
of a system that has a logic of its own that makes demands on us. Like the game
theory logic that Jonathan, you were talking about with like an arms race. I have a colleague,
Michael Hamby, who's been arguing for years. I think this is really a profound point. It's
derived in some sense from Heidegger, but that science has always been technological,
so that in a way that the technological mindset is precisely
presupposed to allow the world to appear in such a way that we make scientific discoveries,
that somehow the kind of technological spirit has been there from the beginning.
And then he adds this point that technology in turn has always been biotechnological.
The technology is always sort of aimed at a kind of replacement. And then one can add that I think
biotechnology is always aimed for this sort of perfection of, you might say, what,
NOAA technology or something that replacing intelligence. It'd be interesting to see,
to think through. There'd be a lot to say about that, but I have this sense. You mentioned the
economic dimensions of it. I have a sense that there seems to be this just fundamental pattern
of thought that runs through all of the modern institutions in politics, in economics, in science,
in the law, that share the same logic of a sort of a system that marginalizes the genuine human
participation in order to perfect itself. And precisely because of that, recognizes no natural
limits and just has this tendency to take over, to encroach on everything. And because it has no
natural limit, I mean, the very sense of it is to go on. Now, that sounds hopeless when one puts it
that way. But I would pick up on a number of the things, John, that you were saying. And Jonathan,
too, here, that that doesn't mean that there's no, there's already hope in the very fact of raising
questions. We don't raise questions simply in order to be able to solve the problem. But our
raising questions is actually our experiencing of humanity and opening up a depth that's the
heart of the matter here. And is always worthwhile. And maybe in some ways is secretly like the saints
praying to keep the world afloat, having conversations like this is a contribution. I mean, I can't
help but think that. Okay, so that's the second set of comments. Then the third is another dimension
that I often hear discussed. And you see, I mean, we're overlapping on all sorts of points,
all of us, I think. But this question of alignment, for me, the biggest worry at a certain
center, at least the first principle one, the more urgent one, is the danger of our aligning
ourselves to the machines, that we that we develop machines that have a certain kind of
intelligence. And then we begin to conform our culture and our mode of being to fit them. I mean,
and the problem is, we actually have thousands of examples of this. We come up with drugs that can
address certain parts of, you know, psychological disorders. And then we reinterpret the psyche
in order to fit that solution to the problem. And my concern is that this AI is not,
they're not just machines, it's a whole culture or a whole way of being that we are going to regard.
So typically, the discussion is presupposes that, you know, we are going to remain unchanged and
we're going to develop these machines that might become dangerous and at a certain point attack
us or something. But I think that that we can help us to become transformed in our intercourse
with them in our making them in our, you know, I mean, in all sorts of profound ways, but then
also just really sort of obvious ways. I mean, they're going to start designing our homes and our
buildings and our cities and our bus routes and our, you know, menus at the restaurants, and they're
going to be writing our music and they're going to design our clothes. I mean, you know, increasingly,
we're going to just conform to this. One of, you know, I don't know if you're familiar with
Walter Ong. It was kind of interesting, what is it about you Canadians that seem to have a special
insight into these kinds of things? I don't know what is Walter Ong, Marshall McLuhan, but Walter
Ong talked about technology as an extension of consciousness. And that's why it's not neutral.
When we use a machine, we're actually entering into it, you know, our spirit is entering into it
in its use and in a certain sense conforming to it. And that's, that's always the case. And it seems
to me that's a particularly pointed way of putting this problem that, you know,
if AI is an extension of our own consciousness, and it has all these features, John, that you
were describing a kind of heartless intelligence, are we going to, in a way, unconsciously and
in, but pervasively develop habits of heartlessness and modes of being, a heartless
mode of being as a result. So I'd have a thousand more things. Your essay was so provocative, John,
as I said, I was dreaming about it all last night. And I, but I'm going to just stop there
so we can have conversation. But thank you. First thing I want to say is that the first
point you made about, if all my essay does is guest people to raise questions the way we're
doing, I'm happy, right? I, I, I, I obviously believe in what I'm arguing or I'd be insane,
but right, like the, like, I'm very happy we're doing this right now. And so I want to, I want to,
so I just want to set that out. And I do think like you, and this is like the Heideggerian hope,
that that, that ability to get scientifically, philosophically, and spiritual profound questioning
going is a source of hope for us. And, and so I just want to acknowledge that I'm fully aligned
with that. This is not, not part of the alignment problem. Okay. The thing about intelligence
being a way of being, I think that's fundamentally right. I have made that argument extensively
and about the work on predictive processing relevance realization. Relevance realization
is not cold calculation. It can't be. It's how you care about this information and don't care
about that information. And I've argued that you only can care about information. And ultimately,
whether or not it's true, good and beautiful, if you are caring about yourself, you have to be a
autopoietic thing, you have to be a self making thing. I agree with you. And I've argued scientifically,
philosophically, there is no intelligence without life. The issue around, I don't like the word
artificial either, because it generally means fraud or simulation, we should be saying
artifactual, that would be a better term. But we have to be careful about what's going on there.
The distinction between strong AI and weak AI is precisely the distinction of simulation versus
instantiation. Can we instantiate things artificially? We seem to have success in other
areas. I'll take one that I think is non controversial. And we discovered something in the project.
So for a long time only, you know, evolved living things could fly. And then we figured
out aerodynamics and we made artificial flight. And I think it would be really weird to say that
airplanes are only simulating flight. That doesn't seem to be a correct because then my trip was
only simulated and I didn't really go to Dallas and so it's a real flight. And so the issue is,
and we discovered something. We discovered that the lift mechanism and the propulsion mechanism
doesn't have to be the same thing the way it is in insects and birds. And that was a bona fide
scientific discovery. That's why initially all the all the initial airplanes and helicopters are so
stupid to our eyes because they thought the lift thing and the propelling thing had to be the same
thing and they don't. And that's a discovery. And that's a real discovery of ontological import
about the causal structure of things. Now, I think I was careful to say I don't anybody who's
rationally reflective about this wouldn't claim that these machines are strong AI
yet. And I positioned AGI as something that's trying to move. But if you remember, I critiqued
and said that they are mostly simulating. They're parasitic on how we organize the dataset, how
we have encoded epistemic relevance into probabilistic relationships between sounds,
how we have organized the internet in terms of what our attention finds salient. And we actually
have to reinforce reinforcement learning with the machine so they don't make wonky
claims and conclusions. That's what I meant by saying it's pantomime. So if we wanted to give them
intelligence as a way of being, which is one of the fundamental claims of 4E cog side that we're
talking about, we're not talking just about the propositional. We're talking about the procedural,
the respect table, the participatory. That's what I meant when I said, and I mean this strongly,
it would depend on, I'll change the term here, artificial auto poesis. Like if these things are
not genuinely taking care of themselves because they're moment by moment making themselves,
there's no reason for them to care about any of the information they're processing. And this goes
towards the defining difference between a simulation and an instantiation. These machines
are doing everything they're doing for us. For it to be real intelligent, they have to be doing
it for themselves. That's that's understanding. And that's why I'm tightening your point. And I've
been arguing it for a long time. Now, what I want you to hear is that this project of not just making
artificial computation, but making auto poetic learning in problem solvers is also ongoing.
Some of my grad students are working on these projects of creating autocatalytic systems that
are also problem solving. Michael Levin's been doing work, like driving down into the biochemistry.
So again, I agree with the point, but it's whether or not it's not the case that nobody is working
on that problem. This is what I mean why there are thresholds possible. Go ahead.
Can I just jump in there? And I should have prefaced, I didn't mean the points I was making
is like a criticism of your presentation, because I understand you've got such rich thinking on
this area. I was mainly using it as a springboard to make some general, okay. Yeah, just so that's
clear. Oh, I hope I wasn't coming off as an offender. No, no, no, no. I just wanted to be clear,
okay, good. That it wasn't a critique. But I would want to, I don't know, and I'd have to think
this through further, but I don't know that the difference between the being conscious and
behaving consciously is quite the same thing as simulation and the distinction between the
instance and the instantiation and simulation. I'd want to say this, because even like the
flying, I mean, that's still an activity, a kind of an operation that's being.
But so is living, right? Well, so that's, yeah, well, that's what I don't, you know,
that's funny. I'm actually working on a paper on this question about metaphysics and life.
And I discovered that philosophers have typically, when they try to understand what life is,
they have typically reduced it to certain kinds of activities or operations. And I think there's
something more profound. And this is why, yeah, I mean, it's one thing to be able to create
something that can actually fly. But could you, could you create something that is a bird and
that would experience just the, what it means to be, you know, I mean, this is, you know,
about, you know, what it means to be a bat, that kind of thing, I suppose. But
that wouldn't be a parasite on our own. But airplanes aren't parasitic on our ability to
fly. I mean, that's why I use the analogy. Okay, but, and that's, okay. And that falls into,
you know, a tool versus an agent. And I get that. But I want to push back, the philosophy of biology,
and I, you know, Dennis Walsh is one of my colleagues, is very much about, no, no, this,
and this is your point, right? It's not just bottom up in order to understand life,
it's not just bottom up causation, we have to understand top down constraints. We have to
understand the way possibility is organized. And we have to talk about virtual governors and
virtually, like, it is no longer the, the bump patient, it's no longer just this bottom up.
The philosophy of biology is pushing very strongly on, well, is evolution really a thing? Well,
if it's really the thing, then there's top down, as well as bottom up. And this is part of this
theorizing. And it's, and this theorizing is being turned towards this. Now, again, we, again,
I'm not making a prediction. We have a threshold, we can just decide, and we might decide for all
the malachian forces and all the things you're saying about how we might just, we might just
diminish our sense of humanity in the face of these machines. But, but I'm also, I want you to
accept that's also not an inevitability. There are, there are alternatives available to us,
and that they could be pursued. And so, I mean, these machines aren't put together the way we put
a table together. We don't even program these machines anymore. That was the big revolution
that Hinton made. We make them so they're dynamically self organizing, and they basically
organize themselves into their capacity. We don't make it.
Yeah. Can I jump in on that point? That's one thing that I would like to think through further.
Is there, is there a difference between being auto poetic, as you're saying, and
begetting another, like, like, genuinely reproductive? And that's, that's where I,
I think it would start to get really, really interesting is, is if a machine could beget
another, because that, that would imply a different, a very different ontology, I would think.
So there's two, there's two things here, and there's two issues. I think it,
I mean, auto poetic things are ontologically different from self organizing things, because
they're self organized to seek out the conditions that produce, protect and promote their own
existence. And so that, that would, that, that means none of the machines we have, like LLMs,
are anywhere near being auto, auto poetic. They are not just made. They're self organizing,
but self organization is in between making and auto poetic. Now the thing about reproduction is,
and I, you know, I, I worry that there's a crypto vitalism in here, that there's some sort of secret,
special stuff to life or to consciousness that isn't being captured. And the problem I have,
the problem I have with that, I'll just shut up after I say my problem, is that seem to commit you
to claiming that, you know, these, a kind of dualism, well, isn't consciousness causal?
Isn't it causal of my behavior and causally responsive to my behavior? And doesn't that mean
there's a huge functional aspect to it? Can you really make this clean distinction between being
conscious and like causing my behavior and having my behavior cause, cause changes in my state of
consciousness? I don't know what that would mean. Same thing with being alive. I do think it's a
profoundly subtle and, and, and maybe some, something that can't be articulated. There's
something that requires intuition rather, you know, insight rather than propositional. I mean,
to use your, so, but, but, but I don't need to interject. Remember, I just want to make sure
we're clear. I argued that we could, this project could show that. Yeah. This project could show
that, no, the machines just can't get there. We have something. It would give, it would give,
I think, pretty convincing evidence that we have this ontological special. Yeah. I find that a really
interesting part of your argument, a really interesting, and that, and especially illuminating.
Also, you know, I mean, in a way, these, these experiments can teach us about the nature of
intelligence precisely in the, in the interesting ways that they fail. Yeah. Yes. But, but I do,
you know, in terms of the dualism, I, I don't think that there's some secret stuff
that is life. But I do think that there's a profound difference between form and matter to use,
you know, to use the sort of classical philosophical language. And that form is not
a special kind of matter. It's something that's of a very different sort. And it's on the basis
of that, that, you know, Aristotle, it's kind of interesting. This is, this is how he, he connects.
So, you know, in the, in the classical tradition, what you're calling auto poetic,
a simple word for it is growth, you know, assimilating things from outside and have that
increase the complexity of the organism. But what's really interesting is that according to
Aristotle, the power of the organism that is connected to nutrition and growth is also connected
to, I think automatically is connected to reproduction. And the, and the reason is that
reproduction rather than just thinking of it materials, materialistically is like generating
more things. Reproduction is the auto poasis of the form of the organism itself. So that bird,
it's not just this bird that wants to increase its existence and therefore eats and so forth,
but that the birdness of the bird also wants to increase itself. And that, that means that it
sort of generates and those are, those are actually forms of the same power, the same dimension of the
being. That's what I'd like. That's, you know, I used to say just sort of kind of in a silly way,
I will take an AI machine seriously when I see it poop. And what I meant by that was,
you know, it's, that's a sign that it's actually got a kind of an organic relationship to its
environment. And it just that doesn't know, we have to tell it that it doesn't care what it's
preparing. And energy pollution is not, heat pollution is not the same thing anyway.
No, but I mean, even in terms of what it is as a large language model and how it spits out
content, we have to tell it this way. That's not indiscreet.
This is to be, this is to be kept. I love David. I think your idea, I mean, this is one of the,
I mentioned this before, like the surprising that the surprise that Darwin in some ways
brought Plato back, you know, in the idea of how we can, we can understand evolution, evolution as
the persistence of being, and even in the notion of forms that there is this idea that there are
identities which are being preserved in reproduction. This is a very interesting idea that I hadn't
thought about in terms of AI, but I'd like to hear John, what you think about that?
Yeah. And so again, for E. Cogsci, Alicia Urrero is a prime and she's explicitly developed to work.
She calls herself an Aristotelian. And the idea that we, we understand form, we're getting an
understanding of it in terms of constraints on a system. And like I said, be, autopoiesis is not
defined solely in terms of causal relationships, bottom up, it's defined in terms of top down
constraint relationships, the form, the formal cause. And so, and then of course, you know,
Darwin needs Mendel. There is a, there is an instantiation, right, of a code
in formation in your DNA that is responsible for your reproduction. And again, I'm not saying
it isn't difficult or challenging, but I don't hear an argument in principle by why
autopoietic things that, artificial autopoietic things wouldn't have something like that kind of,
I don't know what to call it. I mean, to the extent would you, I mean,
would it be conceivable that you would have a thing
that would want to reproduce? I guess, I guess even want is such a hard
concept. But I mean, because you could say, yes, we could teach it that this is something it needs
to do, just like we could, we could, we could, I don't know if living things want to reproduce. I
mean, we may, because we, we can create a reflective space where we consider the possibilities. I
don't know if mosquitoes want to reproduce. I think they just reproduce as part of what they are.
That's interesting. I, I think they have to want to in some sense. I mean, that they're,
they, they feel, I mean, right, they don't want to go down to paramecium because paramecium is
reproduced. Are they wanting? Yeah, I think, I think anything that is living at all has a kind
of natural inclination to reproduce itself. Yeah. I don't disagree with that point. And I even just,
I even understand that there's some, I see what you're saying. There has to be some sort of,
like very primitive caring about information, but I don't, yeah, I want is not a good word there.
But I do think, I do think I'm trying to get, you know, and I hope I'm not trying to be just
self-presentational, but I've represented to both of you before he cogs in a lot of discussions
and about how much it is this multi-leveled, bottom-up, top-down thing. And we're talking
as much about constraints as we are about causes. And that is, that is, that is the cutting edge
of the philosophy of biology right now. And I agree with you. I think, I think it's a kind of
eulomorphism that is emerging out of this understanding. And the thing I'm, I'm also,
I guess, hearing witness to you about is people are taking that understanding and putting it into
like artifactually emergent things. And they, and they're also doing, I just want to put
something that's also there. Yeah, we don't just make kids biologically, we, we, we inculturate them.
And that's the Hegelian argument that I referenced earlier. But there has been,
there's an ongoing project to create sociocultural robotics, Josh Chan and Bob and others.
It's like, I'm asking people, and this is part of asking the good question, don't just zero in on
the LLMs. Yeah. The artificial, the artifactual life, the sociocultural robotics projects are
also going, and there is a real potential for these three to come together in a powerful way
that isn't being properly addressed in a lot of the conversation. May I, may I pick up on that
point and then direct it to Jonathan here? Yeah, I'll shut up. I've been talking too much.
No, no, this is, but that, that, that, that's an interesting thing. If you think of
intelligence in this more organic way and then bring in the cultural element that
raises something that, that occurred to me in this context, it'd be kind of fun to hear your
thoughts. But can you envision, you know, it, would it be, and, and, and John, you'd have
certainly something to say about this too, would it be possible to, to envision a kind of artificial
intelligence that can read symbols that can actually recognize and, I mean, because there's no
culture without, you know, human culture without the symbolic just is pervasive in human culture.
What, what, what kind of intelligence is required to understand and react and engage with? And is
that something that is conceivable that, that a machine of this complex, however complex can do?
Well, I've seen, I mean, I've been playing with chat GPT and Jordan Peterson has been playing
with chat GPT on this regard. And this is the, this is the issue is that they're actually in the
large language model is encoded the analogies that, that basically supports symbolism. And so
the, the chat GPT can give you a pretty good, if you're able to ask the question properly,
chat GPT is actually quite good at seeing analogies that, that would be part of symbolic
understanding. The difficulty just like anything is that just because the, the, the, the, so the,
the model can help you, like if you already have natural insight can help you maybe see
things that you hadn't seen before, but it would also just be gibberish to the type to the person
that doesn't have that insight. So I don't think that the insight is there in the model, but what
it has is a probabilistic capacity to predict, you know, relationships and analogical relationships.
And so it's a, it's actually can be a tool, an interesting tool for symbolism, because sometimes
you can, you can prompt it. It's there, like, do you see a connection between these two images?
And then it'll give you some examples. And then you have this, it can, it has this surprise where
you can actually find, you can actually find relationship that you hadn't thought about.
This is, this is something by the way that this is going to weird people out, but this is something
that I think has existed for very, for a very long time. And is there in kind of what we call
gamatria and rabbinical reading of scripture is that they use mathematical models to find
structures in language that aren't contained at the surface level of, of, of the, of the usual
analogies. And so they, they, they send, they send requests through mathematical calculations
to find surprising connections that then prompt their intuition to, to be able to find connections
that they hadn't thought, found before. And then you have to then make sense of those intuitions.
Obviously, if they're random, they'll just kind of follow, follow away. But this is actually,
this brings me to the, to the, to the, to the point that I wanted to make, which is the relationship
between at least a large language model, because that's what that we know most and, and divination.
Divination? Yeah, and divination. Yeah. Yeah. So,
so, so we talked about the idea that intelligences have to be alive, but I think that most traditional
cultures understand that there are types of intelligence that are not alive, at least not
alive in the way that we understand, that we understand alive in terms of biological beings
that, that, that are born and die, you know, that, that they had a sense that there are
agencies and intelligences that are transpersonal and that, that don't,
that it's always run through human behavior and run through humanity. And those would be,
those intelligences would be contained in our language, like they would necessarily be
contained in the relationship between words and, and, and systems of words, like, you know,
all the syntax and the grammar and all of that. What I see is that I think that ancient people
had, and I don't understand it and I want to be careful, like, because I don't understand,
but I think ancient people had mechanistic ways of tapping into those types of intelligences.
And they, they, they would have mechanistic ways, whether it was tossing something or
throwing things, looking at relationships, almost like random relationships and then
qualifying those random relationships was a way in order to tap into types of intelligences that
ran through their own, their own thing. And what I see is a relationship with the way that the
large language models were trained seemed to be something like that, which is that the, the,
the models generated random, random information. And then you would have humans qualifying that,
that rent, that random, random connections, and then qualifying it, qualifying it through
iterations. So at some point, then they would become like a kind of tech, a technical, say,
a technical way to access intelligent patterns that are, that are coming down into, into the model.
And so that is something that I see, there's a connection between those two. And that what that
means is that just like divination, the, the, the, the thing that I worry about the most is,
again, the sorcerer's apprentice problem, which is that those intelligences that are contained in
our language, we do not, people don't know what humans want. People don't know what,
people don't know what the, all the motivations that are, that are driving us, they don't totally
understand them. They don't understand also the transpersonal types of motivations that,
that can drive us or that can run through our, our societies, you know, sometimes you can see
societies get, become possessed with certain things. I think that's happening now in terms of
certain idea ideologies and things like that. And so the fact that my point is, is that the
fact that on the one hand, we don't understand these types of intelligences. And I think that the
way that the, the, the models are trained and the way that they function seem to be analogous to
the ancient divination practices, like a hyperversion of that, that, how can I say this, is that
there is a great chance that we'll catch something without knowing what we're catching.
That we will basically manifest things, that we have no idea what they are, and we don't
understand the consequences of it. And we don't, you know, because we are, we're just like playing
in a field of, of intelligent patterns and all this chaos without even knowing what it is we're
doing. And I think that we saw that, like, you know, if you remember the being AI, that little
moment when it was kind of unleashed on us, and then all of a sudden the AI was acting like you're,
you know, like, you know, the, the psychotic X or was, was, was becoming paranoid or was doing
all these things. And you could see that what was going on was basically these, these, these
patterns were running through, and they hadn't put the right constraints around them to, to, to
prevent those types of patterns to run through. And those were easy because you recognize your
psycho acts very, very easily. But there are patterns like that, that I don't think, I don't
think we have the wisdom to recognize as it's manifesting itself. And that as these things
get more powerful and more powerful, they will, they will run through our society. And we won't
even know what's happening until it's too late. So that's my biggest warning on AI is I basically,
you know, to sound really scary that I think we're, we're trying to, we're trying to manifest
God without knowing what we're doing. And that will sound freaky to the secular people. But then
if you don't like the word gods, think that there are motivations and patterns of intelligence
that have been around for 100,000 years that have been running through human societies,
and they're contained in our, in our language structures. And, and, and if we just use that,
play around with that with massive amounts of power, then we might have them run through
us without even knowing what's going on. Yeah, I mean, and you say patterns of intelligence,
just just one comment, just the patterns of intelligence, I mean, to pick up, patterns
of intelligence, which also are patterns of caring of a certain sort or not caring. I mean,
there's a, there's that existential dimension that's really crucial. But John, go ahead.
I think this is an excellent point. And I want to address it a little bit at length.
So first of all, when we say these machines predict, if we were speaking very carefully,
what they're predicting is what we, and I don't just mean us individually, I mean, we collectively
would do. And so that's what their avatars of our of the collective intelligence of
our distributed cognition. And so again, that lends weight to Jonathan's point,
which I want to do. And I do think that the way in which we have encoded,
let's I'll just use a term epistemic relevance, like how things are relevant cognitively
into probabilistic relationships between sounds or marks on paper, or and how we've encoded it
into the structuring of the internet and how we encode it and how we gather data and create
these data sets. And how we and how we how we come up with our intuitive judgments on these
machines, we don't know how we're doing a lot of that. That goes back to my concern that we
have hacked our way into this without knowing our way into this. So I take what Jonathan is saying
very seriously, because I think it is a strong implication of a point I made at the very beginning.
My greatest fear by students from like 2001, we'll tell you that John Verweke was worried that we
would hack our way into this rather than knowing our way into this. I don't think that knowing is
sufficient for wisdom, but it's certainly all the philosophers argue that it's a it's a necessary
condition in some fashion. About that, two things to note is that the LLMs, of course,
don't have insight in the sense of being properly self transcending the way they we are. What they're
doing is they're predicting how we would be self transcendent, because of all the ways we have
been self transcended in the past. And that that that goes back to your point, David, about at this
at that stage, we're doing simulation, not instantiation, because again, the machine
isn't caring, the self transcendence, isn't it actually transcending as a self, which is,
I think, definitional for real self transcendence. And so right now, all I'm doing is just saying,
I'm just I'm pouring gasoline on Jonathan's fire. So the fact that there are these huge
patterns at work. Now, one thing is, you know, you have Struck's book on divination in the ancient
world. And what's really interesting, for example, and this is cross cultural, but he's talking mostly
about the Greek world, there was a very strong distinction between sorcery and divination.
Sorcery was criticized both morally and epistemically. And but divination was taken seriously,
and it was carefully cultivated. And there was a there was this, there was a there was a social
cultural project of distinguishing the two trying to like really, really constraining this one, and
really reverentially cultivating a proper participation in the other one. So again,
you know, existence is proof of probability. This is a possible project for us. And this is again,
what I mean when I say theology is going to be one of the most important sciences in the future.
We have to understand how we enter into proper, right, reverential relationships with things we
only have an intuitive grasp of that in very many ways significantly exceed us. Yes. And and and and
secularism has kind has kind of wiped out our education of how we relate to beings that might
be more grander than us by eradicating a religious sensibility. And that has put us bereft us. So
now I think I've strengthened Jonathan's argument a lot. But I do say we do let's take note of what
the ancient cultures have done. We can learn from them. We have a proof that this can be handled well.
And and and secondly, it goes back to my point, if we like, this is going to because of the
monstrosities that come out, this is going to put increasing pressure on us to confront that
threshold of do we want to make themselves transcendent? Do we want to make them and David,
by rational, I don't mean logical. I mean that capacity, right? No, I understand that, right? Yeah,
yeah, right. And so and I think that what I'm saying is I think that strengthens the argument
that we're going to be pushed by the monstrosity of a lot of this to say, oh, we better get these
machines self corrective and properly, right, oriented towards normativity. And again, that's
that's a doable project.
Like if I was if I held the keys to open AI, like if I was one of those that could peek behind the
mask, you've seen that image of the Xtulu monster with like the happy face on it, like the images
of open AI, which is like, you know, we have this like little little window into what's there. But
behind is this massive thing. But like if I had the keys to to those large language models, let's
say the absolute open door to them, you know, it would be very wouldn't it be easy to just
manifest the God of war and win like when it wouldn't. Okay, but let's let's take a historical
example. Yeah, we unleashed a godlike power with atomic warfare. And the monstrosity of that
made me we just that the purely game theoretic machinery built all of these constraints around
it. Yeah, right. And then we also are on the verge, possibly of getting like readily usable,
you know, nuclear power, which I think is the only way we could ever actually go green. I think all
the renewable stuff is going to be like 10% of our energy needs. And if we're going to if we're
going to save the environment and not destroy civilization, I think nuclear power is going to
be essential. A lot of people are making those arguments. And we have a lot of stuff that we
could be doing, the liquid fuel for our reactors and stuff. But what I'm saying is there's
opportunity here too. Yeah, yeah, no, I really take that point. But it is interesting. I mean,
we put 1000 constraints on the use of nuclear weapons, but we've continued to develop them
and improve them and make better and even more destructive ones. I mean, and it'd be interesting
to see if we've ever at any point said, you know what, our nuclear weapons are actually strong enough.
They're powerful enough, and we don't need to advance them anymore. So collectively, I mean,
is there an instance of something like that where we say, you know what, we've actually reached the
limit because we don't we wouldn't really need it for anything further. I mean, that's a
Well, I mean, there was there was a salt treaty, and there was a reduction both in the power and
the number of nuclear weapons. And then of course, you know, the game theoretic things,
they figured a little bit away around it. And it's always this to and froing.
Let me I want to give an example of something that can run through. And I the reason it's a
very, it's very, because I realized I was being too abstract before. So like the day sacrifice,
sacrifice is a is a human universal. It runs through all civilizations. Human sacrifice
runs through all civilizations for the last, you know, tens of thousands of years. It seems to be
a puzzle that humans are trying to deal with without understanding it completely just through
rational means, they're playing it out, they're trying to understand it. scapegoating seems to be
an important aspect of identity formation. And so that is a program that runs through humanity,
and that most people are completely unaware of and are and are not conscious of and don't
take consciously into their into their mind when they're making decisions, they act unconsciously
with that process that is running through them. And so that is an example to me of a of a program
that runs and that is contained and is contained in our, our language structures, our language
structures that have been building up for, you know, tens of thousands of years that we're not
aware of. So if you have a, so this is again, the problem, like if you have a system that's
extremely powerful, and that is running these types of programs of scapegoating and of, and of
identity formation, and the people involved in it are not aware that that's how identity formation
works, that is the type of danger that I'm talking about. Like this is a real thing that as we give
these, these systems, a kind of power over us, or they become the things we go to in order to,
to get our decision making, that those things could be running through without people even
realizing what's happening, and that decisions would be made based on these structures without,
like I said, without even knowing. Those are the things that those are those are just one example,
but that's a very simple example that we can kind of track and we could see that, you know, the
the ancient, because when we talk about ancient divination, we have to remember that it's like
the ancient gods asked for blood, my friends, like those programs, they asked for blood, and they
knew that you had to kill a bunch of people on that pyramid in order to continue your civilization,
like it's, and that's, that is encoded in our culture and is encoded secretly in our, our language.
You know, and, and so an example, like I do believe that, let's say that the Christian story is a way
to deal with that, but the rest is still all there. And we default to it really fast without even,
like World War Two is a lot of that stuff going on. Sure. Especially, yeah. Yeah. But
the, the point is that just as there's these implicit monsters that we have sewn in unaware,
there are also the implicit counteractors, maybe angels, if I'm allowed to speak mythologically,
that we've also sewn in. And I mean, there's the actual revolution, you see the Buddha,
you see Plato really undermining the grammar of sacrifice. And of course, Jesus of Nazareth does
that in a profound way. And we have to remember that that's there too. And what that requires is
putting into the data set and altering the pathways in the internet so that this information
goes into these machines as well. And again, is that happening right now? No. Could it happen?
Yes. And it might happen if these machines start sacrificing themselves. And we might have to say,
what are they doing? Like, and we'd like, and this again, we'll, at some point, we have to
decide, are we going to let them be really massively self destructive? And the economic
powers are not going to imagine if every time you try to make an atomic bomb, it kept dissolving,
right? Like, like you stop pumping money in. Yeah, it won't say they won't sacrifice themselves,
they'll sacrifice us. But why we don't we sacrifice ourselves? Yeah, well, we I mean,
let's say the the scapegoat mechanism is usually defined a other. Yeah, yeah, but we invoked World
War Two, we weren't killing goats and chickens, we were killing each other and our own populations
in a huge sacrificial act. And that's what I was picking up on, right? When it becomes
titanic and monstrous. That's where it moves to. But I'm saying is, like, this is a Jungian term,
right? Yeah, like the idea that, yes, there's all this pre egoic stuff sowing in. But there's
also a lot of trans egoic stuff sowing in. And we just have to properly get it in there so that
we've got the, you know, the collective self correction going on, like we did. I mean,
civilizations get some self correcting processes in here, because they don't devolve. No, they
periodically, periodically, massively collapse. And that's by the way, that's something I made
an argument I made in my paper, these things can't accelerate to an infinity of intelligence,
there is built in diminishing returns, there's built in general system collapse to these things.
So again, we have to be careful about, I mean, we don't know what the limit is and our imagine
our intuitive imagination is not good. We know that there are hard and fast
our prior arguments that that this will threshold at this will live at some point.
And and that also gives me comfort. At least like encoded in our myth or our mythology,
there seems to be some stories of the relationship between transpersonal agency and technology as
being the cause of the end of a civilization, right, that the whole Enochian Enochian tradition
seems to be encoding something like that through mythological language, which is that humans were
able to to connect somehow with these transpersonal intelligences, and that those were encoded in
technical means, and that this brought about the the end of an age. So yeah, so it's like it's
there. That part of it is there in our story, too. Like there is that story.
Yeah, but there's also a cross cultures. There's the Noah story. Yeah, there's the person that has
the right relationship to ultimately, right? That's right. There's a technological response.
The art, right? I agree. I agree. I totally agree with that. I mean, even like in the in the revelation
image that I've given several times, you have these two images. One is the beast that creates
an image of itself and makes it speak, and then seduces everybody by the speaking image,
you know, that. And then there's this other image of a right relationship of technist,
technist and civilization to the transcendent. These two kind of are put up against each other
as two possible outcomes. I mean, the question that arises for me in this context,
connects this question with that with I think what strikes me is kind of an interesting
philosophical question. But John, you made the distinction between divination and sorcery.
And and as I understand it, and you can correct me on this, but at the at the foundation of that
distinction is the difference between, you know, sorcery would be in a way using
the trans personal powers, these sort of higher powers, whereas divination would be, in a way,
receiving, you know, the the the disposition of race activity. So in one case, you've got
human ends that you that you try to then enlist the help of superhuman forces to
and the the irony is it's precisely when you're trying to use something that you become used
to yourself. And that's that's where you get this dialectic, whereas divination, it's entering
into a relationship where where one disposes oneself to hear and receive, and therefore,
in a certain sense, conform to something greater than oneself. And there you see, it's a very
different kind of thing. And ironically, in a way, you enter into it more receptive, receptively,
but that's precisely why you don't become then a tool of it. Interestingly, now, now for me,
the question is, how that relates to this issue is, is, you know, it may be the case that you've
got encoded in the language, both sacrifice in the sense of violence, you know, renaissance or
the scapegoat thing, on the one hand, and then the other hand, self sacrifice in the sense of
of generous love and so forth. Those might both be encoded in the language. But here's here's the
question to me is, is it possible the kind that the kind of race activity that divination implies,
the capacity to actually see another as other and recognize and be open in this kind of radical way,
is that something that a machine can ever learn to do? Is it possible actually to
behold another simply, you know, or is there, you know, is it and it seems to me that there's
something profoundly different between seeing truth, genuinely seeing truth on the one hand,
and being self-corrective on the other. And the kind of genuinely seeing what's true,
you know, I don't know if that in itself can be encoded in language, we can tell stories about
people that did that, but can the actual insight into truth be encoded simply and pass them? Do
you see, do you see what I'm, the question I'm raising? Okay, so I, again, I think that if we,
again, open up beyond the propositional and we're talking about being true to
and, and your aim being true, that we, the machine has perspectival abilities,
noetic abilities, not just dianetic abilities, and we can't use that term because of Elron Hubbard,
but you know what I meant, right? And again, this is the, and this is part of the argument
that, at the core of my work, you know, it's like, so in a moment of insight, you're not just
self-correcting, you are attracted and drawn into you, you love the new reality that is disclosed
because there's a perspectival and participatory thing. That's what I meant when I said there
isn't real self-transcendence unless there's a self that is transcending, right?
Yeah, right, right. Okay, now, and then the question is, but we're back to our fundamental
ontological questions, is, and I've already said, there's no way a Newtonian mechanical
computation is going to get there. And so I won't be bound to that because I'm not bound to that.
I have a professional career of criticizing that, right? So is there, is there a dynamical systems
updated, hulemorphic, auto-poietic possibility? I think there is. I think there is, I think the
answer is a very real yes for that. And I don't think we're going to find the answer to that just
encoded in the syntactic and semantic relationships between our terms. I think we have to look and,
you know, our inaction, how we're enacting, embedded, extended, right, and embodied in a
profound way to get those answers. And so my answer is, in that way, a qualified yes, I do think it
is possible. And the problem is that, go ahead, go ahead, say what you need to say, please.
Be really precise, just so I understand. So we've been talking about this sort of predictive,
you know, calculating probabilities, drawing on everything that's ever been said and being able
to derive in some sense from that. Do you think that we can get to a moment where we actually
transcend that, that crossed that threshold beyond that?
Not with the LLMs as they are. That's my argument. Not with the LLMs as they are. They can't get
there. Yeah, John's radical proposition is to, is to embody, embody and enculture them. And that is
the only way we will actually get properly rational beings and beings that care about it and care about
some things. Right. I mean, that's the irony in the question, you know, can we give them more and
more models to teach them at some point to not have to use models? And I mean, do you see it's
actually really, I don't, I don't think it's possible without, right, but kids have a soul,
you know, it's possible to do that if you have, but I don't mean this as like woo-woo stuff. I mean
that they, that a natural thing has a principle of unity that transcends the differentiation of the
parts and allows those parts to be intrinsically related to each other. And that principle of
unity that transcends the differentiation of the parts that allows them to be an organism actually
allows them at the same time to have a kind of unity with something other than themselves
that transcends the parts of their differentiation. So there's a kind of an intimacy there.
I agree with that ontology. And what I'm arguing is dynamical systems theory is now giving explanations
of that that are derived from Aristotelian ontology, but make use of like a lot of cutting edge
science that we've, yeah, we now can start to explain how there is a unity that is not reducible
just to some summation of its parts and how that unity has a top-down influence on the entity that
is not reducible to its causes. And, and, and, and I think this is becoming a non-controversial
thing to say. And I find, and now we might just add a clash of intuitions and I'm willing to stop
there. I can't see there being like that seems to me to be capturing what we're talking about.
And you have an intuition that there's something more, but I don't know, I don't see
you something more. And maybe that's where we're sitting. Well, I think it's the intuition David
has in tell me if I'm wrong, David, and because it connects to the way I think is that there's,
it's that unity is given. It cannot be made. And I know that sounds weird, but it's some,
it's somehow, it's like, if I'm making even, even internal technology, right? It's like,
if I'm making a car that unity is given, I'm gathering things towards that purpose.
Right. And so the, the purpose, the, the unity part of something is always, it comes from heaven
in the sense that you can't make it. It's, it's given from, from, it's, it's already taken for
granted even before you start to unify multiplicity together. And that in the making of these beings,
we have that problem. It's like we're doing it completely. We're doing a bottom up. Like,
if we can, we gather enough stuff so that this stuff reaches a unity.
Right. See, if I just could just, it seems to me that if this is ever going to be possible,
it would have to take, so, and when I raise the question, it's actually a question. So I don't
mean to be like challenging that it can't possibly happen. I'm just thinking about what would be the
condition. Please remember that I said we might realize that we can't and that would be important.
Well, yeah. So, so it seems to me if, if, if it were to be possible, it would have to be something
like a kind of electronic analog to cloning that you, that you take.
So what have I told you that we now have electro bio, like we have systems that are electrochemical,
biological versions of memory that are now in production and they, we don't make them.
They self-organize and emerge and they emerge bottom up from the causal interactions,
but they are also top down constrained by, you know, principles of self-organization.
Like that already exists. Yeah. Yeah. And, but right. No. Well, that's, that's what I'm asking
about because it, because it seems to me, but there is, there is going to be, you're, you're
deriving not from models, you're deriving from real intelligent beings now, which is a slightly
different thing. And, and I mean, that would be interesting is, is, is that, because to me,
that the bottom up top down is not quite adequate and the top down constraints is not quite,
because it would have to be not just a constraint, but because that presupposes that there was
something there that then, that the constraint is coming from outside. And what I'm talking about
is a kind of a unity that precedes, that's presupposed. And, and, and I'm wondering how you
can get that into something if it's the very nature of it to be presupposed. And I, and I'm not
saying you can't, but I'm saying if you can, it's, it's, it seems to me that you're going to have
to somehow derive it from a living thing. And that's conceivable. That's conceivable, I suppose,
but we are talking about something really frightening. We are, and that's why I keep
saying it's a threshold. And, and I mean, if you take the, the sort of biological analogy seriously
the way, or he does, of course, it precedes the organism, it's there in the environment,
it's there in the society, it's there in the, I mean, I can roll in a hundred Hegelian arguments
here about how it does, right, about how, right. And, you know, and, and those don't have to be
supernaturalistic. You have Brandom and Pinker and others saying, no, this can be given a completely
naturalistic explanation. And, and, and I'm not here to challenge things. But what I'm saying is
I don't have any problem acknowledging everything you just said. And, and, and, and I don't think
I'm misunderstanding you. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, and I, I mean, I'm actually, I mean,
this sort of just an exploratory sort of way, but I wonder if there's a difference between the
unity of an, of an organism. And this is where Hegel might not be so helpful. The difference
between the, the, the givenness of the unity of an organism and the givenness of the unity of a
society, or a culture, but those aren't exactly the same thing. Because there's, there's something,
and there's a kind of, you know, relative priority of either one, but there's something really
distinctive about the unity of an organism that's very, yeah, that, that, that I think is crucial
to this question, to my mind in a way. And I'm not saying it can't be answered, but that's the
question of what has to be answered. How do we actually reproduce that kind of unity?
We know stuff that Aristotle didn't know. You are not an Aristotelian unity. You are a society.
You literally are billions of animals, right? And so that's important. And that means the,
there might not be a difference in kind between how you are organized as a living thing and how
societies are organized. And people like Michael Levin are producing some really important empirical
evidence indicating that's kind of the case. And I'm not saying it's not saying anything's
conclusive, but it needs to be taken seriously. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think that, that I agree
with you, John. And I think that, that that's the way that I try to always speak about agency
intelligence is one that tries to scale almost effortlessly through the different, you know,
to avoid the woo soul that we're afraid of. But then again, this is the, this is the issue,
like this is in some ways that it's the same problem, like one way or the other. So let's say
you have a group that self-organizes around a purpose, right? Or self-organizes around affiliation
or some type of origin, right? That affiliation, that purpose is also given, right? It's like it
appears as a revelation. And then all of a sudden we're all hunting a line together. And now we're
a group and we're moving towards, towards a purpose. Now, this is the, this is the,
this is the problem with the situation of what's going now is that what is it? What angel are we
catching? Like what, what, what God are we trying to, to manifest? Like which unity, what purpose?
We have no idea. So we're building this massive body, like this huge and most powerful body
that's ever existed, but nobody knows what it is we're trying to catch. Because if I get together
with a bunch of guys to play basketball, I know what that body is. I know what that,
what that, that, that, that a genetic body, intelligent body is, is, is moving towards.
Right. Right. If I get together with my family and I celebrate our unity, it's because I know
that we all come from the same parent and that there's a, there's affiliation that makes our
society coherent towards something. But now we have this problem, which is what? Like what are
we doing? Like we're just building this giant body. It's like, I agree. And I've agreed with
that. Yeah. And the thing that, that, that's so odd. I mean, typically, if you think of technology
as a human creation in some good positive sense, it's, it's, it has limits and it has a particular
place. It has a particular meaning. It has a particular purpose precisely because we
create it in order to solve some kind of a problem. We, you know, there's some, there's some need that
needs to be filled and that need has a kind of natural givenness or, or, or, or it's revealed
somehow that, you know, it's a responsive to something that we see. What's so interesting,
Neil Postman made this point about, you know, when, when he, he, he said, he went to a car dealership
and wanted to buy a car. And the man was explained to him that they had now these, you know, automatic
windows that, that, that would roll down at the push of a button. And he, and he said, he said,
his, his, I mean, this sounds so naive, but it's, it's a profoundly interesting question. He said,
well, what problem does that solve? And of course, the problem that it solves is the problem of
rolling a window down. And his response was, I never perceived that to be a problem.
You know, I mean, and it's really interesting AI. I mean, the thing is what problem are we
creating it to solve? I mean, in a certain sense, it's a very different mindset. We're just kind of
taking, we just want to see what we can do and see what can be done. And, and in a, in a way,
the problems are something that we are arriving at and are surprising us, rather than something that
we're actually creating something that just simple, simple task of solving for us. You see, I mean,
I think that's connected to this being placing ourselves in that, in the hands of an angel of
some sort, or, or, you know, entering into a kind of an agency that's bigger than we are.
Those are all connected.
They are. But, I mean, one problem was trying to be solved was the scientific problem of,
like, strongly AI was a project of explaining intelligence. And that's a, that's a worthy
thing to do. And the fact that this technology has largely been separated.
But notice, that's interesting. That's, that's, that's not a, a technical prop, like,
you explaining something, it's actually, I mean, to, to use the classical distinction between
theory and practice, that's a sort of a theoretical issue rather than a practical one.
But we think of this as a, as a technology. I mean, it's a, it's a, that's a curious thing.
Well, yeah. And I would get into things like books, our technologies that move between the
theoretical and practical. It's one of the greatest technologies we ever invented,
and it had all kinds of unforeseen consequences. And it really massively disrupted society.
But, you know, and, but I wanted to make another point, and this isn't a challenge.
This is just a clarification point, right? These, like,
like, think about a computer, what problem does a computer solve? It doesn't solve a problem.
It is meant to be a multiple problem solver. And then what we're trying to do is make a
general problem solver. So what problem is it's trying to solve? It's not trying to solve any
problem. It's trying to enhance our abilities to solve all the problems we try to solve.
So this machine's going to help us in medicine. It already is. It's going to help us, right?
Like that's, and so that, that, that's the answer. Now, again, that's not a challenge.
That's, I'm just speaking on behalf of the people that think about this.
But it is kind of interesting. I mean, so, so the problem that it's solving is the, is the,
the need to be able to solve any possible problem solving a meta problem. Yeah. Yes.
Yeah. But, but I mean, but it, but it is kind of, it's, it's sort of, it's sort of curious that
precisely because of the, the indeterminacy of that, we're, we're exposing this. And I'm just
sort of stating, you know, our condition here in a way, we're exposing ourselves to a really great
risk. I'm just restating what everybody has been saying here today. But that's, that's something
that, that, you know, requires some wisdom, as you've been saying over and over, John, and, and,
and, and prayer to use Jonathan's language too. I just want to do one, can't you, John,
mentioned in the, in the, in the, in my essay, which is we, we have done this before. That's how
civilization emerged. Nobody built it to solve a problem. There's a bunch of little problems. And
what civilization is, is a meta problem solver, right? And that's, that's what it is. And then,
and then you can, so I've actually suggested we should also be paying attention to the, the, the
lifetimes and the life cycles of civilizations and how civilizations reproduce and why they rise
and why they fall to get some better understanding. Some other ways of thinking about these machines.
Yeah. So we're, the civilizations are huge, distributed cognition, collective intelligence
machines. That's, that's the living in cities is a horrible idea, except for the fact that it gives us
better access to the collective intelligence of distributed cognition. That's the, that's the
benefit that outweighs all the many noxious side effects of living in cities. You can also get
better coffee, typically. Yeah. So we're, we're coming toward the end of our time here. I mean,
this has been fantastic. I rarely can go for two hours on any conversation. We were just, we've
just been going. Well, not only go for two hours, but sort of wish we had another two. Well, that's
what I was going to say. I mean, we can, we can, we can work on doing this again, because it feels
like we're, we're sort of, we finally all come together around something here. And now we're
really asking what feels like a really important question to me is, well, how do we think about
integrating this solution, this meta solution into our meta problems? And that's, that's a really
interesting question. I think that John bringing up civilization is such a great point, something
that I would really love to explore, because there is also, you know, in the kind of inscribed in
the mythological stories, a relationship between transpersonal agency and civilization itself,
right? Like if you want to understand why the Egyptians had their king as a god and like all
this type of structure, you can help you, it can help you understand how they're trying to capture,
you know, higher forms of intelligence, distributed intelligence, the intelligences
in their society. And the idea that we would be doing this technically in AI, I think is
something that definitely is worth thinking about and discussing.
Yeah. No, that's a dimension I'd just never struck me before. So that's, that's really
helpful. Is this the enough, maybe, maybe there's something we could read together and
I mean, short, but, but to prompt another conversation along these lines of civilization.
Yeah. I would, I would recommend just because this is how YouTube works that we, we come to
decisions about that off camera. All right. Okay, cool. There you go. Right. I do, if, if, if
there's a call for me to hang out with you fellows again, I don't care what we're talking about,
I'm in, I want to be here, I want to do it. So that's all I'll say about the invitation. Same here.
Any closing thoughts, things that feel like need to be brought in or do we feel good about this?
Just, just a word of thank you, Ken. You were the, the one who arranged this and you did the
persistent work to make it happen and find a hole in everybody's calendar that lined up,
not an easy thing to do. So thank you, Ken. And thanks for being gracious for these years now
that I've known you. Yeah. And in addition to thinking, Ken, I want to thank you, David and
you, Jonathan. I always find it, I get to places in my thinking, the logos that I could not possibly
get on my own when I get into a living relationship with both of you in conversation and in discussion.
And so I appreciate it greatly. And I just wanted to say thank you. Yeah, thanks to you guys.
This has been great. And I'm like, again, same, you, John and I've been trying to have the
conversation for nine months and we just keep like, I cancel, he cancels, and then this is
wonderful that we were able to, to finally get here. Yeah. Well, thank you all. It's been a real pleasure.
