Who really runs the world today? Is it politicians or multinational banks,
or is it social media and tech giants? In this conversation, I speak with economists,
politician and author Yanis Varoufakis, who served as the Greek minister of finance during the 2015
Greek credit crisis. We discuss how economies crash, the winners and losers of bank bailouts,
dysfunctions within the EU, and the real power that politicians have access to in the face of
their political rivals and the rising influence of social media and tech monopolies. I'm Shane

Just to make this more pleasurable, though, would you like a little bit of an overview,
or are you just happy to jump in? Let's go straight in. Let's go straight in.
Because I was originally going to ask you questions like what's the best place to go swimming in
Greece then? There is a cove on a barren island off the island where I live, which is where I've
asked my wife to scatter my ashes when I'm done. I don't even know what's called because it's a
barren island. There's no name, at least not that I know. For me, that's the spot. But I'm not going
to tell you how to find it. I'm not going to give you the coordinates because it's a very well kept
secret. But why? What's the beautiful thing about the island? What draws you to it?
Well, look, we live on an island about a stone's throw from Athens. And because where we are, it
looks to the other side of Athens, so we can't see the idleness of the cement blocks. And we can see
the beautiful mountains of the Peloponnese. It feels as if we are a very, very long way from
civilization. But we're not. We're only one hour's ferry, right? And then on a little boat,
we sail to this tiny island, which is 20 minutes away at 15 knots. And on the other side of the
island, there is this little cove with deep blue waters and pine trees coming all the way down to
the sea. And that's like being, you know, a million miles away. And it's the human scale.
The trees are, you know, my height, a bit taller, maybe double my height. The stones, the rocks,
the fish, they're all, you know, as I said, at the human scale, there are no sharks,
there are no currents. It is just like it was designed by some divinity for us. So there,
that's my, the best I can do. So when you're dealing with politics and the economy all day,
just getting back and being a human voice. And I am away. I'm in paradise. And also the proximity,
the fact that it's so close, I can do this every day almost. So let's do it in theory.
Well, especially when you're not anywhere near Greece, you can't do it. But let's jump into
the economy and politics then. So there's two real questions I want to ask you. And they're
very basic. I basically want to ask you what money is and who holds power in the world.
So these are the two questions. And I thought I'd start off at a very basic level. You used to be,
oh, you've worked as an economics professor. And so what I want to know is, in your mind,
is economics more like the study of psychology or more like, say, physics in your mind?
Okay, big questions. What's money? The best definition of money I've come across is by Carl
Marx. He defined money as the alienated ability of humankind. I think it's such a poetic and accurate
description because money, you see, it's a bit like in physics, since you're a physicist,
it's a bit like light. For centuries, there were deep divisions between scientists on whether it's
a stream of particles or a wave. So you had huge disagreements. Newton thought it was particles,
Maxl thought it was waves, democracy thought it was particles, people thought it was waves.
Until Einstein comes on and says, guys, it's both. Which is very difficult for the human mind to wrap
itself around the idea that it can be both two things that are contradictory.
Now, in physics, you can actually prove these hypotheses. You conduct experiments under
controlled conditions and you can actually prove it. Money is very similar in the sense that it's
got two different natures that seem absolutely incompatible with one another. And yet, money is
both those things. The equivalent of the particle theory of light for money is that it is a thing,
that money is a thing, it's a commodity. Yeah, you have wheat, you have corn that can be used
to eat. It can be used to plow the fields in the form of seeds. That's capital. But it can also be
used in order to exchange. So you exchange a pound of corn for a bundle of butter or something.
So there is a tendency to think of, especially the gold bugs, those who believe that money has to
be something tangible, like gold, like a metal. It must be substantive, not the figment of our
imagination, like digital money or paper money. They tend to think of money as a thing, a commodity,
a tangible. And then there is a completely different view that money is nothing more than a
transferable form of debt. So if you look at archaeological evidence, there is plenty of it,
that money did not emerge as a thing, but it emerged as a form of debt. In Syria, in the Mesopotamia,
there were, we have evidence that the first form of widely, widely, widely used money
were shards of clay with numbers on them. And the idea was that the hegemon, the landlord, the king,
the tyrant, whatever, would use these pieces of clay with numbers on to pay advance payment
of the wheat, the corn that had not already been produced, that would be produced after the harvest,
to workers. So workers would go home at the end of each day, every week,
with one of those pieces of clay with a number. And that's how numbers were invented.
That's how accounting happened. This is how writing was discovered or invented.
The first instances of writing had to do with these payment systems. So if it had the number two,
it meant two pounds or ounces or something of wheat was owed to you because you had worked in
the fields. So you'd have to wait for it. Now, the beauty of it was, of course, that you didn't
have to wait to cash it in for wheat. You could use these pieces of clay to go to your next-door
neighbor and say, listen, you've got a goat, can I have some of its milk? And here is, you know,
a piece of clay that is like a title deed to an ounce of wheat in three months time.
So what is money? Is it a thing? Is it a promise? That? And the answer
is that it is both, in the same way that light is both. So that's the best I can do
in order to introduce our audience to the complexity of money and why I love the definition
of Marx, that it is the alienated ability of humankind. It's been alienated from us,
it's been obstructed, but it reflects our ability to do things individually and collectively.
Your second question, I forgot because I'm getting old.
Well, we'll get into that towards the end of it. So ultimately, we'll touch on
that's where we're going to end up. Okay.
Hopefully. We may not, but it depends where we take things. But okay, so this abstraction then,
so this is sort of how I pitch a money, sort of a shared fiction. And I guess the next sort of
obvious question that I want to ask is, when our economy crashes, when we go through some
turbulent economic times, what's happening there? Is it that the abstraction is breaking down that
out, shared fiction is breaking or is something else going on? Sort of at the lowest level?
Well, the shared fiction breaks down because promises have been made that cannot be kept.
That's what's going on. That's what the crisis is. So to the extent that the liquidity
of an economic system is a form of debt that is transferable. What's that? It's a promise.
You give me the pint of milk, and I promise you something at the end of the month,
some wheat or pounds or sterling or whatever.
Now, in the old epochs, eras, you would have war, you would have pestilence,
you would have bad weather. That was the cause of the crisis really, earthquakes.
You didn't have a collapse of economic forces feeding into a kind of domino effect. There were
occasions when poverty or overextending a military effort, kings that made too many
promises to their people and to their soldiers as to how much loot they would get if they pursue
the war together and then if the war didn't go well, all these promises broke down. But this was
not an endogenous economic crisis. It was not a crisis of the economy. It was a crisis of politics,
it was a crisis of the weather. It was a crisis of a military campaign going wrong.
It was the advent of capitalism that gave rise to purely economic crisis. The reason for that is
that there's been a great transformation somewhere around the 18th century when we moved from
feudalism to capitalism. Because if you think about it, under feudalism, the order of play
was rather straightforward. First, you had production. The peasants toiled the land,
they produced agricultural goods. That was the production phase. Production came first.
Second came the distribution phase. The lord would send the sheriff to the peasants,
armed and dangerous, and the sheriff would steal a percentage of the harvest. On behalf of the
landlord, it was just pure theft on behalf of legalized theft. That's what feudalism was.
So you had distribution. This second phase, violent phase, at least potentially violent
phase, determined how much of the produce would stay with the peasants, how much would go with
the landlord. And then the third phase was financialization. The landlord could not eat all that
stuff. So the landlord would sell it in rudimentary markets that were marginal to production, but
nevertheless important. Get cash and use that cash either to arm an army, his soldiers, or to build
a better castle, or to found a church, or to lend it. Because the lords were the money lenders as
well, because they were the only ones who had money. So you had production, distribution, and
financialization. In societies like that, it was impossible to have an endogenous economic crisis.
But with the advent of capitalism, the transformation, when the peasants were expelled from the land,
they were replaced by sheep in England, in Scotland, and Wales, because wool was an international
commodity by then, due to the discovery of international trade rules and the creation of
international trade rules. You have the creation of a working class, which is landless. They've
been evicted. They live in slums now, outside the land. The land now is commodified. It is leased
to former peasants, or to the sheriff, or to whomever, who now becomes a proper capitalist
who hires laborers and pays rent to the landlord. But these proto-capitalists
to make business work, to start production, first they had to borrow, because they had to pay wages
up in upfront, so that the workers would not die of hunger, not because they were nice people,
but because otherwise they wouldn't be able to get them to work. And also they had to pay the
landlord rent before the harvest came in. So suddenly what you have is a complete reversal.
It used to be production, distribution, finance. Now it's finance, distribution, and finally
production. And this reversal unleashed tremendous productive powers. Workers were forced to be
far more efficient. The entrepreneurs, the proto-capitalists, because they were struggling
themselves to keep their nose above water, they had to improve efficiency. They had to invest in
machinery in order to enhance labor productivity, because they were in competition with one another
and anyone who didn't do it simply went bankrupt. So because finance now is at the
at the beginning of this production process. Finance is the linchpin for this new system
called capitalism. Bankers begin to emerge as the liquidity providers of this system,
the lubricants, the lubricators of the system. And the more this system becomes efficient,
the greater the cut that the bankers retain. So the way I've described this is in a book
a few years ago, was to say that it is a bit like
bankers had time traveling hands. They would push their hand through the membrane of the timeline
and extract value from the future that has not been created yet. Bring it to the present
to fund the production that will produce the values of the future. And that, of course,
made them central in this chain and allowed them to become very rich. And the more they lent,
the more value they extracted from the future to bring to the present, the richer they go.
But that meant that at some point they extracted so much value from the future
that the present could not be delivered. The present could not repay the future.
And that's when promises are broken. Debt are issued that cannot be repaid. And when those
accumulate at some point, like grains of sand that you lay one on top of the other at some point,
there's going to be an implosion. And that's an economic crisis. At that point,
you have a situation where the alienated ability of humankind is in crisis, it's in a vortex,
and you've got unpayable debts. And that's when you have the eradication of debts,
because debts that cannot be paid will not be paid.
So in 2008, where we had the bailout of the banks, I want to understand sort of how dirty
this process was. Because if I follow what you're saying, what I understand is happening is that
the banks have a whole bunch of assets that have accumulated that are not good, they're toxic in
some sense, like loans that will never be repaid, this sort of thing. And so then the central bank
steps in and buys them all out at some price. That's sort of, in some sense, if I understand,
putting the hand into the future. I want to understand.
Ah, no, no, it's not the same thing. Because you see, when you put your hand into the future,
you extract value to bring it in to produce new value. What happened with the central banks was
none of that. It was simply printing money to make failed bets all. Not the same thing. There
was never any productive benefit from doing this. They salvaged the banks by creating money to replace
their busted flushes, their busted wages, their busted bets.
I guess then the question that I have is, ultimately, who wins and who loses? Who is it
that's paying to buy out those busted bets, the toxic assets?
Well, it depends on what's happening in the rest of the economy as well. I'm quite relaxed about
you know, forgiving debts and writing them off. You have to do it. As I said, an unpayable debt
will not be paid. So you need to write it off. There are two ways of writing it off. One is to
just write it off. It's really very simple. Say, okay, this IOU is going to be torn up
because it cannot be paid. That to me is the honest and uncomplicated way of doing it.
But if you want to pretend that the debt is sacred and it will be repaid, then the only way of
pretending that an unpayable debt can be repaid is by constantly rolling it over,
lending the busted entity, the failed banker for instance, money, continue to give him
liquidity in the form of short-term, medium-term, long-term debt, so as to allow him to pretend
that he is honoring the IOUs that he's issued. Now, again, it really is no skin of my nose
whether you excuse him the debt or whether you roll it over. So the question is, what
is happening, however, around this little drama? Because the tragedy of 2008 and beyond was that
while we had socialism for the bankers, central banks were printing state money to give it almost
philanthropically to the bankers, they were imposing harsh austerity on the innocents,
other people who had not done nothing wrong and who had not benefited for years and years and years
through financialization, through betting on impossible horses in the financial sector.
So when you have socialism for the very few who happen to be the financiers and austerity for
everywhere else, you end up with a catastrophe that we've experienced over the last 13 years
because the financiers get their money.
There is the ethical question as well. The people who created the crisis get power and money
and the people who suffered the crisis and who never benefited from the
makings of the crisis, the many, are suffering austerity, they can't put food on the table.
They can't go to sleep at night because they're so surrounded, so much in the clasps of angst
about how they're going to make ends meet by the end of the week. But besides the ethical
point, there's a macroeconomic point as well because the industrialists, the people who benefited
from socialism for the very few for the oligarchy, look at, they have all this money which is being
printed by the central banks and given to them, right? But they're never going to invest it because
not because they don't want to invest, they would like to, they would like to invest it,
but they look out there and they see the masses, the multitudes being impecunious and finding it
very hard to make ends meet and they think, I'm not going to produce snazzy expensive products
for them, they won't be able to afford it. So if you're Volkswagen in 2009, you're not going to
say, I'm going to produce an alternative to a Tesla and expensive $100,000 electric car because
who the hell is going to buy it? Look at them. I'll make little gulfs with stupid little polluting
diesel engines. As I was doing before, I will fake their exhaustive measurements as well,
and you know, make money out of that, out of the little people with small dirty little cars that
sell to them. So you've got very low levels of investments and that also augurs really badly
for the green transition because for 13 years we have not invested in the green transition
as we should have and we can see the effects on the environment now. You can see it on electricity,
I mean, we have under invested for 13 years. So the tragedy, the crime of the post 2008
period, it's not just that you have excused those busted wages of the finances and that
you have printed money as if in the context of a socialism for the rich to give to them.
It's also that the austerity you've imposed upon people in the European Union, people in the United
Kingdom, people in the United States, I mean, here in this country where the champions were
stated, world record holders when it came to state, to idiotic austerity, self-defeating austerity,
and the result is that you have very low levels of investment. And when you have very low levels
of investment, what does this mean? It means the demand is low and it means that the only way you
can keep finances in health in better commerce or alive or zombified, call it what you might
may, is to keep printing money to keep to them because they are not going to get it from the
little people because the little people don't have any and because there's no investment
to produce new wealth for the bankers to benefit. So for 13 years after 2008, we have had rude health
in the financial markets, which was, however, driven by state money that was printed and printed,
printed to keep the finances boisterous, while the rest of the economy was shrinking.
So how long can you push this for? What's the if there's sort of two questions I want to ask. The
first is, you know, what would you have done instead? What's the alternative? You know,
did you have to inject the money up at the level of banks or could have you given money to the
people who made the, you know, did you have to inject money at the level of banks or could have
been at the level of the people? And what is the long term impact if we continue to do quantitative
easing and we continue to give austerity to the people and not the banks? Well, the first question
that came out of your mouth was how long can this last for? The answer was until the pandemic,
because now it's all collapsing around us. We can see that. But before I explain why that is
happening, let me answer your other question. What could we have done instead? And I think you already
embedded into your question the proper answer. The first thing you do is, of course, you save
the banks. Because banks are not like other businesses. If a bike shop shuts down, okay,
you don't have bikes. But a bank, for better or for worse, I think for worse, the banks own the
payment system. Forget credit. You know, whenever you want to buy coffee these days, or buy a book,
or go to the movies or whatever, you need to make a payment. And you make a payment using
a debit card or credit card, or even some ATM from which you withdraw money. And that's all owned
by the banking system, by the oligopoly of the banksters. So you need to save those banks. You
can't allow the ATMs to shut down at the payment system to collapse. Because then you'll have another
great depression like we had after 1949. And only monsters, Nazis and fascists emerge from that.
But it's one thing to say you should save the banks. It's quite another
to say that you must save the bankers. So what I would have done, that would have picked up the
phone and called them and say, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. We will save the
bank. That's a good news. The bad news we're not going to save you. You are out. So shareholders
are wiped out. Board of directors are fired. They are nationalized. And they're saved. And this is
not buying the sky stuff. This is precisely what happened in 1998 in South Korea. You know, the
Korean state got into the failed private banks, took them over, drove out the
the board of directors. I remember I was having a very intense conversation with the finance minister
of South Korea. And I asked him, how did you do that? Because we are having such difficulty. I
mean, you know, bankers are so powerful people. So powerful people. I mean, they have more powerful
than they have more power than us ministers of finance. You know, they can fire us.
He said, well, we'll use them in a very, very difficult institution in Korea.
He said, what? He said, well, the Marines. I said the Marines in and had them leave the building
at gunpoint. And I thought, that's a very good idea. So they saved the banks and within a year
and a half, they had sold them back to the private sector because they were not Marxists,
the left wing lingers like me. But they didn't save the bankers. So the message to bankers was,
if you, if you steer your bank onto the rocks and it starts sinking, we will save the vessel,
but not you. So big. Okay, that was the number one thing that I would.
Can I ask just quick quickly, did that have a lasting effect? So what happened in 2008 and
later on? Did the did Korea have a sort of softer journey as a result of that prior policy?
Absolutely. Look at the data Korea had next to no crisis in 2008. What had happened in 1998
shielded Korea from the vagaries of Wall Street, the city of London, what's happening in the European
Union, come from from strength to strength. And it wasn't just South Korea. It was six years
before South Korea. It was Scandinavia. The Scandinavian banks in 1992 went bust, all of them,
that made some stupid decisions. And they all went bust, Swedish banks, Danish banks, Norwegian
banks, Finnish banks, and the states back then, they would say social democratic back then, no
longer, they, they bailed out the banks, got rid of the bankers, nationalized the banks, and then
sold them off within two years back to the private sector to different bankers. And they didn't have
the same problems in 2008 that the Anglo, the Anglo sphere had, as well as the European Union.
So that's one thing I would do, save the banks, not the bankers. The second thing I would do, and
you already foreshadowed that in your question, if I wanted to boost demand, I would not give it to
the financiers. I wouldn't print money to give to the financiers. I would give it to little people.
I mean, Donald Trump did it. And then Joe Biden continued with the checks in the mail to little
people. The Australian government did it in 2009 under Kevin Rudd. And the result was that Australia
did not have a recession in 2009, because every household, you probably recall that, got something
between 10 and 20 thousand Australian dollars. It missed me, unfortunately. I was a little bit
annoyed about that. Yeah, all my friends got the, yeah. So, you know, even during the pandemic,
when the central bank of Europe was printing, as if there was no tomorrow, I was warning them,
I was saying, you're creating a gigantic bubble in real estate, because the money will go from the
central bank, the financiers, from the financiers to their mates, their mates are going to take
the stock exchange or buy flats in Berlin. Asset prices will go through the roof. That will create
us the price inflation. That will increase the shortfall, actually reduce further investment.
And that's going to shrink aggregate supply of goods and services. And then at some point,
some of that money will leak into the economy, and it's going to be inflation. And then you'll be
stopped, which is where they are. So the alternative proposition was, why don't you just
send some like 500 euros I proposed, or a thousand years, or two thousand years, depending
on the length of the pandemic, send it to people's bank accounts. And the most astonishing answer I
got from German colleagues, politicians and bankers and so on, is you can't do that. So why
can't you do it? We don't have the know how. So what? Because our social security numbers
are not connected to our banking system. And therefore, technically, we cannot even send
them money. We can't do what Trump and Biden did. And I thought, my goodness, this is the
state of Europe. The great German efficient state cannot even find its citizens and give them some
money. They can take them, they can't give it. Okay, so this makes me think of something else
that I'm quite curious about, which is that in Europe, we don't have big tech competitors.
So for example, there's no, you know, French Twitter, there's no, why, why is it that on these
technical grounds, people seem more competent in the United States? Why is it that you have these,
you know, blossoming tech companies that are missing here?
Well, the hegemon always produces cutting edge technologies. Before America rose,
almost every important technological breakthrough was made in Cambridge, Oxford,
the University of London, in Britain. Britain was the empire. It produced the technological
advances. Before that, it was Rome. So there's nothing terribly surprising about that.
Size also matters. You have a very large economy in the United States.
You've got English, you've got the size of America, you've got English. So if you were going to start
Twitter in France, it wouldn't really go that far. Twitter went far because from day one,
it was used by us Greeks, by Australians, by the Portuguese and so on and so forth.
And first mover advantage is everything. So once you created Facebook, there can't be another
Facebook even in the United States, even in the United States. If you and I had a much better
software for a Facebook competitor, it wouldn't matter because if anyone wants to join
something like Facebook, they will go to where their friends are. So there is the first mover
advantage, which is really very strong. Now, the only country that has developed competitors,
real competitors, substantial competitors, very strong competitors to big tech is China.
But that's because there was a political project to do so.
They understood really very well that if the whole of the Chinese political economy and society
enter Facebook, Twitter, buy everything from Amazon.com and so on,
any possibility of autonomous growth and development in China is gone. Europe never
understood that. And you know, we now are in a kind of semi-war between Europe and America
over social media. You've got the European Commission constantly sniping at Twitter,
at Facebook, at Google, at Apple, imposing fines, Ms. Vestager, she does well. I mean,
she's right on many of the issues that she's got. But as you pointed out,
this is just a defensive war. There is no attempt or capacity of the European Union,
despite the fact that we are more than the Americans put together. We're richer than the
Americans put together. We have a lot of technologies. We cannot bring it together
and create either competitive to Amazon.com or to Alibaba in China. So with every crisis
and every technological advance, Europe falls behind both China and the United States of America.
It still surprises me that you say this because we had, for example,
Myspace, which was taken over by Facebook. And I guess now Facebook's shares are really
tumbling in the last weeks. And I guess TikTok is sort of rolling over YouTube. So there are
examples of other tech companies rising up. Yeah, so you think...
Yeah, because it's Chinese, it's not European.
That's true. That's true. I can't think of a European one, except Spotify.
Excellent. Do you think the EU is taking appropriate steps then to break up these
monopolies? Or no? You think they should go further? Or how should they help companies
in their own sort of domain develop competitors? How about having a lobotomy to begin with
and starting afresh? Because the situation with the European Union is beyond a joke.
They have completely failed to rise up to the great challenges of the time.
And what are the great challenges of the time? The banking crisis of 2008,
the European Union made a complete and utter mess of it. And the result now is that we have
13 years of centrifugal forces tearing the European Union of Art. And that has never subsided.
They just threw a lot of printed money on the problem under Mario Draghi. But without solving
the underlying centrifugal forces that are tearing us apart. So banking crisis, disaster.
Green energy, catastrophe. I mean, think about it. We have something called the European Union,
but we do not have an energy plan for Europe. Germany has its own plans. And we saw how great
those were when Putin invaded the Ukraine. France has its own polyonic nuclear-based plan.
Half of the nuclear power stations now that they are necessary because the
height and price of natural gas are now defunct. They are out of commission. Greece has its own
plan. It's pathetic. I wish we had a European Union. We do not. We have something that
pretends to be a union. Artificial intelligence, nothing. Zero. There's no plan for artificial
intelligence. There are pockets of AI here and there. But nothing like the concentrated
investment on AI that the Japanese have, that the Koreans have, that the Chinese have. Of course,
in the Americans, you've got a lot of rent seeking in Europe. There is hardly any entrepreneurship
happening. The big wigs are simply trying to extract whatever value has already been created
without producing new value. And we do not have a government. We have a bureaucracy whose job
in Brussels is to behave like the bureaucracy of a cartel. The nearest parallel analog to the
European Union Commission is OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. They have a
bureaucracy. Their purpose is to coordinate the activities of the different countries with a view
to simply maximizing the extraction of rents from the rest of the world. But this can never be the
source of innovative thinking about creating new values. It's only innovative thinking about how
to corner existing markets. That's what the European Union Commission is. And whenever they have a
good idea, because there are some good ideas that come out of the Commission since I remember in the
1990s, they've all been vetoed by Berlin. All of them, every single one of them. In some European
Union Council has been vetoed by Berlin. And if not by Berlin, by one of the 100 maidens of
Berlin, because sometimes Berlin doesn't want to be seen to be the bad guy or girl in the case of
Berlin, they ask the Slovak or the Dutch to veto it on their behalf.
So then what does the US have that the EU is lacking? What is it that makes the US function
which doesn't allow the EU to function a similar way?
Common debt. Treasury bills. You know the treasury, the US treasury. We have a central bank here in
Europe and they have a central bank. But if you think of how we constructed it,
it was as if constructed by morons in order to serve slaves. Because what we did, we created
the central bank without a state behind it. There's no state that can have the back of the European
central bank. And you have 19 states, now it's 20 states, that use this central bank for the money
but cannot rely on it in case there's a banking crisis to bail them out. Because it's by its
constitution, it's not allowed to bail them out. So they had to ban the constitution of the ECB,
the charter of the ECB in order to bail them out. But to do this, they had to get the permission
from Berlin to do it. So it's a catastrophe. It's exactly what Alexander Hamilton in the United
States was trying to avoid and succeeded in avoiding. Situation where you have different states,
different formal colonies, supposedly one country but without common debt. Common debt is everything.
It's what binds states together. What binds the British together is not so much, you know,
the royal family. It is the pound and the fact that the north of England and the south of England
share the debt, the national debt. That's what gives substance to countries. How long with languages
and traditions and conventions and all that jazz, as they say.
I don't want to sound too conspiratorial. You mentioned the system is created as though by
morons. But could it be that it was constructed in this way to force federation further down the
line? Is there some sort of intent behind a system which seems not to work currently in your mind?
Look, there were some smart people who thought of the Euro and the European Central Bank in those
terms. And one of them was President Mitterrand of France, François Mitterrand in the 80s and 90s.
I have done good authority, I've written about this.
There was a friend of mine who was in the room in 1992 when the Maastricht Treaty,
which is the foundational treaty of the European Central Bank, was signed. There was a discussion
between the President of France, François Mitterrand and the President of the European
Commission at the time, Jacques Delors, who was a friend of Mitterrand and who had been his finance
minister many years before, with a friend of mine in the room. And Jacques Delors,
representing the European Commission at the time, was trying to convince the French president
that it is important to have two pylons, two legs for the Eurozone. One should be the Central Bank
to guarantee monetary stability and another one should be something like an investment ministry
or a treasury that would borrow on behalf of the whole of the Eurozone area in order to invest.
So there would be the stability leg and the growth or development leg,
which of course meant a political union. It meant that if you have a common debt,
you have to have common rules. Who borrows? You need to have a common parliament or parliamentary
process to approve the common debt. François Mitterrand turned around and said what you said.
He said, listen, Jacques, that would be great to do that. We can't do it. We don't have the political
clouds today at the moment. What we can do is we can create a monetary union. And this is where
the old fox, François Mitterrand, proved he had very clear vision of the future. He said, when
the next large financial crisis comes, our successors will have to choose between letting
this whole thing collapse or federating or doing what you're suggesting. So this is
precisely what you're saying. However, he was wrong. And he was wrong for reasons that a British
Cambridge economist had foreseen in 1971, in April 1971, Nicolas Calder was his name,
a well-known economist of the Cambridge tradition, who was actually Eurofiled. He wanted the European
Union to come together. And he was writing that paper as somebody who's worried about the future
of the European common market back then, the European Union today. So this is now April 1971,
just before a few months, before the collapse of the Bretton Wood system and the fixed exchange
rates, when the Europeans could see that it was happening, that the exchange rates would no longer
be fixed. They needed the exchange rates to be fixed because the European Union was a cartel.
They were trying to sell to fix the price of coal, to fix the price of steel, to fix the price of
cars. If exchange rates between France and Germany and Italy and Holland go up and down,
it's very difficult to fix prices. So they needed the fixed exchange rates that the Americans were
providing under the Bretton Woods. And they could see that these fixed exchange rates would blow
up. So they were already planning a common currency or fixed exchange rates in Europe
as a prelude to the Euro, back in 1971. And Caldor in the new statesman said this.
He said it would be a gross mistake. I don't have his names now, his words in my head to tell you
about it, but I can assure you, you can look it up. I've republished that paper as well in my books,
in a couple of my books. He said, if we make the mistake of thinking that through a monetary
union, we create a stepping stone towards federation, we will have killed off maybe,
and that was not the words he used, we will have annulled the possibility of a political union
because he explains. A monetary union without a political union is like putting the cart before
the horses. A monetary union without a political union in common debt is going to create a gigantic
financial crisis by itself. And when it hits, we are going to suffer massive centrifugal forces
politically, socially at the level of discourse, and the Europeans will not be able to politically
to unite after that. And I think that this is exactly what happens. I suppose you're looting to
the rise of sort of right-leaning politicians and not just after, you know, when the banking crisis
happened, it started in Wall Street, as it usually does, like 1929, it started in 2007-2008
in Wall Street. Then very soon after that, we realized that the French and the German banks
were kaput gone. A domino effect starts. Once the German and the French banks are bankrupt,
they can no longer roll over the Greek government debt, the Italian government debt,
the Irish government debt, because they were the banks that were lending those
states. And then there is, of course, a feedback loop, because once the front page of newspapers
is full of news of the Greek state's bankruptcy, and everybody knows that the Greek state owes
120-130 billion euros to the German banks and another 100 to the French banks,
then that makes the position of the French and the German banks even worse. And then what happens
is, then politicians start pointing accusatory fingers at one another. The German politicians
are pointing their fingers at the Greeks. You messed this thing up. It is because you were so
spendthrift and because you sung and played the Buzuki under the sun in the summer and it didn't
work. And then the Greeks turn around and the pointing accusatory fingers are at the German
in the beginning. You are Nazis. You've never been anything other than Nazis. That's it. It's
finished. At that moment, you have centrifugal forces at the cultural level, the political level,
the ethical level, every level. And you go now to any German or to any Greek, any Dutch man or
woman or French person and say, do you think it's a good idea that we should
federate in Europe? They say, bugger off immediately, which would not be the case before 2010.
So I think that Nicolas Calder was completely prescient.
So sort of shot ourselves in the foot. I noticed that, so in respect for the time,
we're going to have to wrap up fairly soon. Can I just ask with a few and with a few quick
questions about power? So the main one is who holds the power today? Is it Musk? Is it Biden?
Is it the head of the IMF or Goldman Sachs? Where does power really reside today?
The hardest aspect of contemporary society to comprehend is that we live in a capitalist world
or post-capitalist world where power has been concentrated tremendously
inside the confines of a new form of capital
without any human being, Musk, Biden, whoever, being in command of it.
If you look at Musk on a minute by minute basis, if you actually watch him work, you can see that
this is a driven man who's got enormous resources, his disposal, but given his ambition and his
different projects, he's very constrained. He feels the pressure. He doesn't feel like somebody
who can do anything. He doesn't feel like God. Similarly, Jeff Bezos, he's got hundreds of
billions stashed away in terms of wealth, but he too feels constrained. So this is a great
tragedy and a great paradox. It's like an ancient Greek tragedy. If you're watching or Shakespeare,
if you're watching a Shakespearean play, reserve the third. What do you see? You see powerful men
on a stage who nevertheless, their great tragedy is that the more power they have,
the more powerless they feel. And it's the nature of the game which extracts power from the many,
concentrates in the hands of a few who are tragic figures and therefore powerless.
This is how I understand the capitalist post-capitalist system we live in,
and that's why I continue to be a leftist who thinks that capitalism is neither natural nor
pleasant or stable for that matter. In the end, we've created magnificent machines
that had the capacity of being our slaves. I'm a tech enthusiast. I love machinery. I love
technology. But in the end, we become the slaves of the machines. And that is not simply to say
that this is the rich versus the poor. There is, of course, the rich versus the poor. We see this
on a daily basis. But in the end, even the rich, even the Elon Musk's of the world,
the Jeff Bezos of the world, they are also victims of this enslavement of the whole of
humanity to our artifacts. A kind of Dr. Frankenstein who created the thing, this capitalist
thing, which has taken over and is threatening our very existentialist condition.
Did you also feel that sort of at your core in the place of the finance minister of Greece?
Did you feel that you had less or more power than what you anticipated when you entered the role?
Oh, I had exactly as much power as I had anticipated, precisely zero.
I knew I would have none. I knew I would have none because, remember, the only reason why I was
elected was because we had a massive bankruptcy. And I had become the finance minister of the most
bankrupt state in the world after Puerto Rico, maybe. So I knew that I wouldn't have any power.
The only power I had was the power to say no, not to put my signature on another credit card
on behalf of my people. And that's why I was so demonized and so despised by the powers that
be. They could not believe that I had the audacity not to take their money or credit cards.
So let me let me end by asking you, I mean, you took the job.
So you must take the job. I mean, yeah. So let me let me end by asking,
it's actually sort of two questions. How do you decide, as a Marxist or a socialist,
which trenches to die in? So for example, do you buy shares? Do you do you
shop in Amazon? You know, where do you decide on moral ethical grounds? No, I'm not going to go
down that path. So that's the first question. And to wrap up, let me answer it because I would
forget it. Firstly, I don't buy shares. I have a natural and an empathy and ideological opposition
to share markets. That's why my last book, which was a science fiction novel and other now,
where I try to imagine a different world, there are no share markets.
So no, I don't believe in horse races. I don't believe in the stock of change. I hate derivatives.
I don't do it. Only, you know, I only buy shares indirectly when I can't stop it
due to the super valuation fund buying shares on my behalf without asking me, right?
But I would never buy consciously and purposely purposefully shares. Do I buy Amazon.com stuff?
Of course I do. Because we live in capitalism. I'm not going to survive if I simply eat and
consume products produced under socialist order, which doesn't exist.
When do I choose to do something like, for instance, accepting the Ministry of Finance?
Well, that election in January 2015 was the election of a political party that had a reason
from 4% to almost 40% in two years as a result of the popular rebellion against the dead bondage
of whole people. The reason I said yes was because for four years I was criticizing what
the parties that we were doing. My proposals, similar to what I was discussing with you
about what to do with the banks, what to do with furlough wages, how to empower the many,
these proposals were accepted and embraced by a young man who's going to be prime minister,
very improbable prime minister, because as I said, up until two years before he had 4% of the vote.
And people were eating out of rubbish bins. As a result of this enslavement,
dead bondage, it was like, Greece had become like something like a Victorian workhouse.
And I was elected. I didn't think I was going to, you know, affect the transition from capitalism
to socialism or anything stupid like that. I had one task that I wanted to accomplish,
and I was planning to resign the moment that task was accomplished or the moment I realized I could
not accomplish it. And the task was to haircut the Greek debt so that we no longer took more credit
cards on conditions of further austerity that forced more people to eat out of rubbish bins.
So that's when my ethos tells me, do it. This is a job that you should try to do,
even if the probability of success is low.
So let me finish by just asking you simply, what makes you happy and what makes you look
forward to the future? What is it that really drives you and gives you hope?
Well, besides being with the people that I love and listening to the music that
that permits me to forget who I am, for me, good art, good music, good cinema
must help me forget who I am. But I need to lose myself in this. So when I lose myself in good
stuff, stuff that other talented people have created, I'm at I think at my happiest. That's
why I'm married to an artist as well. But more generally, I'll give you the answer that
Captain Picard gives in the next generation of Star Trek, which is, of course, a major source
of philosophical insights for me, because I'm a trekker, I don't know whether you know that.
I'm a fanatical trekker. When he's asked, so they find in space, in one of the episodes,
in the very last episode of season one, they find some frozen people from the 20th century,
industrialists who froze themselves and had themselves their bodies covered in space in case
they're rescued and fixed and cured in the future. Of course, this happens 24th century.
One of these unfrozen businessmen from the 20th century says to Picard, so you have no money
here. There are no markets. Everybody gets what their basic needs covered. So what do you do?
What's the point of your existence? And Picard says, my friend, to improve yourself.
I think anything that you're doing to improve yourself in a self-motivated way. You play the
piano a little bit better. You write a better article, a better book. You learn how to appreciate
a beautiful sunset more maturely than you did the previous day or the previous year.
That's the stuff of life. You make the world just that little bit more beautiful.
Yanis, it's been an absolute pleasure. Welcome back anytime. Thanks for coming on.
Thank you, Shen. That was fun.
