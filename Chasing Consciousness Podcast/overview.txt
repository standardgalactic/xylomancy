Checking Chasing Consciousness Podcast/EXAMINING FREE WILL - Susan Blackmore PHD #30.txt
 Throughout the conversation, the host and Sue Blackmore discuss the complexity of studying consciousness and the limitations of human thought in understanding it. The host brings up a previous point made by Sue, highlighting the irony that while she has often emphasized there's nothing to "get" about consciousness, they might end up with a moment of not understandingâ€”a "don't get it" moment. Sue acknowledges this and appreciates the opportunity to discuss these ideas.

The host expresses gratitude to Sue for her enthusiasm in joining the podcast before its official launch and notes that it feels validating to have one's thoughts and perspectives acknowledged by someone with Sue's expertise. The host also extends an invitation to Sue to return for season three of the podcast to delve deeper into Sue's work, particularly focusing on memetics as presented in her 1999 book "The Meme Machine."

Sue agrees to come back and discuss how memetics are relevant today, especially considering the proliferation of information and media independence. The host emphasizes that understanding memetics is crucial for navigating the current information landscape and avoiding the spread of biased or inaccurate information.

The conversation also touches on the ancient debate about free will, with Sue suggesting that much of the torment experienced by those who obsess over philosophical questions about consciousness and free will is unnecessary. The host agrees that recognizing this can be a great relief and might be a necessary step to reaching a different understanding or perspective.

In summary, the host and Sue Blackmore engage in a thought-provoking conversation about consciousness, memetics, and the pursuit of understanding free will, with an emphasis on the importance of acknowledging the limitations of human thought and the value of embracing not knowing. They look forward to continuing the discussion in future episodes.
