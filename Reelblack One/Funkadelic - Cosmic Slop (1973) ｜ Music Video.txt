I want to vibe on to my mother, And notice us to him, three young brothers,
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough, Not always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide,
The fact from us that life was really tough, I can hear my mother call, I can hear my mother call,
Late at night I hear her call, On the note I hear her call she said,
Father, father, it's for the kids, And everything I did, please, please don't judge me too strong,
Mother knows I'm in no row, Mother knows I'm in no row,
Bring the devil's sign, Would you like to dance with me, we're doing the cosmic stop,
She was run over together, The tricks were coming, they go,
The neighbors were talking, call her, there's a bell,
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide,
The fact from us that she was catching him, Hey, hear my mother call, I can hear my mother call,
Late at night I hear her call, On the note I hear her call she said,
Father, father, it's for the kids, And everything I did, please, please don't judge me too strong,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
She said, Father, father, it's for the kids, And everything I did, please don't judge me too strong,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
I can hear my mother call, I can hear my mother call,
Mother knows I'm in no row,
I can hear my mother call,
