Welcome everybody to Science Technology and the future.
Welcome Robin.
Welcome Adam.
Well Robin of course is the author of some pretty big ideas, the great filter, burning
the cosmic commons, grabby aliens and more recently he's been writing about cultural
drift, where it could go wrong and potential ways to fix it.
So Robin I'll quickly give you the opportunity to describe what you mean by cultural drift.
So I feel like I should first acknowledge that this feels a little weird in terms of
the kind of topic it is compared to what I've done for most of my life.
So you call your thing science and technology and usually in the futurism world for decades
we would focus on technologies and how they would change society and change the world.
And that's a sort of natural place to sit in and it fits very naturally with a STEM
background and you know in that world you would hear people talk about culture and
how important culture was and it wouldn't make that much sense to you and it sounds
sort of fuzzy and think well that's all nice for you know if you want to you know enjoy
your leisure time doing culture things but we're talking about important stuff here.
And you know I would tend to dismiss that sort of discussion so I feel somewhat embarrassed
and awkward to have to come around and say oh well this is really important actually.
This is central.
So interesting yeah my channel name is science technology in the future but often I end up
talking about philosophy, ethics and other things that people wouldn't normally associate
with science technology in the future.
So maybe there's been a bit of a drift.
Right or just maybe everything's connected and if you're going to talk about interesting
stuff you can't that much predict where it'll go.
You just have to leave yourself open to where your reasoning will take you.
So eight months or so ago I started to think about fertility because I realized that if
population were to fall we wouldn't have the same per capita growth because innovation
would slow down and grind to a halt.
And I just think of so many things in our society is driven by innovation that that's
a really radical scenario to think about it's really disturbing to imagine innovation
grinding for a halt and then staying that way for several centuries.
That basically puts off many of my technology futures.
The age of M or even cryonics basically cryonics I'd have to wait for several centuries to
be revived if I wasn't revived before this fall and that's a pretty disturbing scenario
and so I started to think a lot more about fertility and what was driving that.
And I think we can at least identify some policies there that might reverse the problem.
They may be hard to get people to adopt but I think we can figure out some things that
could work.
But if you think about the proximate causes of fertility fall they end up being cultural
trends.
Trends like longer career paths of education, moving from cornerstone to capstone marriage,
higher standards for how much attention parents would pay to kids, less involvement of grandparents.
A lot of social trends who end up pushing for lower fertility and these trends are different
all around the world but nevertheless the overall fertility decline is much more consistent
around the world.
And so something suggests that cultures around the world aren't as different as you might
think because they have some variations but they end up with this relatively consistent
overall trend and that culture is approximate cause of fertility decline and that makes
you wonder, well, gee, why are cultures pushing this way or even why are they changing so
much as they are?
I switched to thinking about cultural evolution, how culture works and there's a whole field
of cultural evolution that's relatively sort of mathematical even and scientific trying
to model itself on biological evolution as a variation on traditional biological evolution
and it seems to be pretty solid.
Recent book The Secret of Our Success by Heinrich is a book about that topic and if
you think about cultural evolution you realize that it can go wrong in some ways and that
it might in fact be going wrong in our world today and that that might plausibly be behind
fertility fall and therefore this problem I was focused on which is pretty serious and
hard to fix but at least we can think of some ways to fix it and there's an underlying
problem plausibly causing that which is deeper and harder to fix and so I've been thinking
about that for the last three months.
What is it and how could we fix it and how can we understand it?
So this isn't explaining it yet, I'm sort of setting up the context for why we would
care about this and why we want to think about it a little better.
The key idea of cultural evolution is that humans had the super power that other animals
didn't have which is the power to copy each other's behavior.
Horizontal transfer, say again, horizontal transfer, yes, that is yes so and there are
analog models to biological evolution which are cultural evolution which include ways
culture moves from not just your parents but from your parents associates and from
your associates and slightly different models for how this works and this allows change
to be much faster and has allowed humans to speed up our change in growth compared to
other animals it's the source of our super power even more so than our intelligence
plausibly the what we needed intelligence for was to allow culture but once we had
culture we could go zooming fast so it's really important to understand what it is
and how it works to understand how it is we're doing so well.
It's innovation you've mentioned that fertility brings innovation or there's a connection
there so I guess once we reach a certain level of intelligence you're saying that we could
just have more intelligence by sheer numbers of people and therefore the numbers of people
would increase overall cognitive power and so other animals you know for other animals
to get to have better behavior they have to encode it in their DNA and then express their
DNA when they grow up which is a very slow process for selecting for different DNA that
encodes behavior whereas for humans we could you know invent a behavior or stumble into
a behavior see that it works and then other people could copy our behavior because it
was working for us and then we could accumulate a library of good behaviors much more quickly
than we could by encoding them in DNA that's the key idea of culture is that we can grow
much faster because we no longer have to wait for you know random DNA mutations to encode
a behavior and then for those descendants to slowly grow in number because they have
that behavior more that's very slow laborious process whereas if we can just copy other
people's behavior that seems to work then we can quickly accumulate a package of behaviors
that work and yeah so in some sense our intelligence isn't so much our sort of raw brain structure
it's all the things we fill that brain with all the rules of thumb and habits and things
we learn that we can fill our brains with that let us be powerful and capable so that's
humanity superpower but it's a new system and it's crude and not as reliable as DNA evolution
it's only been around for a few hundred thousand years hundreds of millions of years right
and you've been around for a couple hundred thousand years yeah and so only in a few million
you know billions of copies of humans over this time so vastly smaller history than all
the history of life on earth so you should expect problems with it it's not going to
be elegant and all the little you know rough edges smooths off and everything it's going
to be crucial okay but it's powerful it's like a sports car something that breaks down
a lot or like maybe compare the first airplanes that we had which were spectacular and fly
but crashed a lot to airplanes today which almost never crashed a place for commercial
flights so the key concept in culture evolution is if you just randomly copied other people's
behaviors that wouldn't help just having some people copy other people's behaviors at random
just leaves the same pool of average behaviors and we don't get a better pool of behaviors
the key thing for culture evolution to work is to be able to distinguish success from failure
and copy success so for example if you want to be able to better fisher and you can go look
at a bunch of people fishing and you can see who catches the most fish at least per hour of effort
or something and you want to copy their fishing behavior and then you could be the better fisher
and if everybody does that we'll all slowly get better at fishing if we all copy the best
fisher's behavior at any one time then if somebody manages to change how they fish and that works
better for them we can see that works better then we copy them so you know a cultural evolution
doesn't work without being able to see success somehow and not just see success see roughly
what kinds of behaviors are related to that success you know if you copy everything about the best
fisher how they dress how they sleep blah blah blah right it won't be as smart as if you know
fishing behavior when they're next to the water fishing copy that stuff not just everything right
so that's cultural evolution that's retired to being able to see success
so it's not just yeah you just got to find the salient form throughout the related to fishing
that works and not just how uh you know the color of the fisherman's hat you know or the particular
brand of fishing rod that they might have as long as it works right now but a lot of our
intelligence and ability to reason was plausibly created by cultural evolution
we have powerful intellectual abilities but they may not be so much embodied in our brain
structure they may be things culture taught us and you know obviously culture taught us how to
say do math how to do writing and reading but it may have caught us even taught us just very basic
reasoning other animals don't seem that good at reasoning at least we can't tell and even our most
basic cognitive capacities that we're proud of as humans they may have come from culture
they have come from this process copying each other's habits um it reminds me of a really
interesting idea do you think like if we were to take a baby um you know just give it all a book
with all the information and it would be able to speed run its way through to modern civilization
much faster than we would get there um if you know that that history showed compared to somebody who
lived in this day and time and if you put them back you know uh 15 000 years or even earlier
do you think they'd be able to speed run much faster to modern civilization knowing what modern
civilization is today perhaps they would because they would have had that cultural all that cultural
stockpiling behind they'd have to find a way to translate the knowledge they have that works in
our world to this older world yeah and so a lot of what we know doesn't only works because we're in a
modern context and it's a challenge so certainly you know King Arthur's you know Connecticut Yankee
and King Arthur's court those sort of stories the characters have to be very careful to find
something from the modern world that actually works in the old world that they can impress people
with and it's there's a famous uh story about um the you know the the um one eyed man is king in
the land of the blind there's a saying like that and hg wells has a story where he tries to show
that not be a true Joan vinge came out with that did she I don't know but about her science fiction
but but hg wells has a short story where he shows a man who is the one eyed man in the
line of the plan not succeeding very well because even though he can see some things he can't quite
figure out how to take advantage of it in that world um so uh that's the caution but certainly
you know that's one of the ideas of course of say you know civilized people going to less civilized
places and trying to show them how to do things often the challenge is what you know how to do
is based on the materials and equipment and the options in your world and if you don't bring those
with you then it can be harder to make them valuable but I apologize Joan vinn said in
in the land of the blind the one eyed man is stoned to death yes well that's the story of hg wells
actually uh he has a story that basically has that lesson about it anyway um so culture requires
that we uh can tell what to copy but initially it probably was very simple um we just so most
animals have a pecking order like a status hierarchy most social animals do and so the
simplest version of culture would be just to copy the high status people because they're somehow
winning in your world they're doing better than the others and do whatever the high status people
do would be a very simple heuristic could that have could have gotten cultural evolution going
but then cultural evolution would want to accumulate more ways to think about figuring out who to copy
and who not to copy for what to make the process work better but the very beginning of the process
would be just very simple copy success and success would just be the simple measure of success that
social animals have always had some animals are dominant over others right so so you're defining
innovation as not something that scientists and engineers come up with today it's a whole it's a
whole it's a wider spectrum of things oh sure it's a whole thing that that might be can you explain
what you mean by innovation so just like a better way to fish better way to hunt better way to build
a hut better way to make a shoe you know a better way to handle disputes new words in a language
new different habits of handling your children relating to neighbors like every social practices
if they're different they might be better so innovation is substituting some you know
worse practices for better ones you know and um that's innovation as you accumulate better practices
better habits better ways of doing things innovation is the process of swapping out the
worst and swapping in the better um and today we're having more people um we have an innovation
we might end up at an innovation bottleneck but i know what a lot of people who are um
may be thinking who are watching this and they might be thinking well why can't we just um
take the function of innovation the function what happens when you have lots of people
and just use algorithms and computers and ai as it's getting more powerful and um indirectly
and partially through tool ai or even like you know create the sort of transformative ai that we
might be seeing in the next decades um yeah why can't we just do that and and have technology
replace the function of innovation that normally pops out of human brains and social practices so
in our economy today it grows it's you know doubles roughly every 15 or 20 years and the
main reason it grows is innovation that's the consensus of the economy studying growth and
innovation is primarily driven by you know new companies introducing new products and new technologies
and new practices distributing through the human world and we use whatever aids we can
in all our technologies including when we innovate and innovation has been helped somewhat by say
having the internet and having you know computer communication and then uh being able to do
experiments online and you know all of the technology we've accumulated has been used in
general to quite improve it our innovation um but it's slow and hard uh we aren't having
enormous bursts in our rate of innovation lately we've had a pretty steady rate of innovation over
the last half century say even slowing a bit if anything uh even though we've had a lot more
computers so computers aren't you know so far not a easy answer for improving innovation it's
still hard to innovate uh but we're doing the best we can and hopefully uh when say AI actually
starts being more productive then it will actually help us innovate more we'll we'll just have to see
or we could augment humans right sure there's a genetic relationship to advancing technology
or create ends right so so there's obviously lots of potential in the future for doing innovation
faster better um but the problem is so far uh you know what's people who do the innovation
and if you just have a lot fewer people you're just going to have a lot less innovation
uh of the sort that we've had for the last century so we haven't found ways to make capital
that much more productive in innovation compared to people that are standard models of
the value of capital and labor is that if the population declines innovation will in fact decline
now if we can produce a human level artificial intelligence then that would that could completely
substitute for people then the game's over then then we you know then it doesn't matter how many
people there are it matters how many people substitutes there are but we're not there yet
and we might not be for a while and why do you think we're slowing down innovation is it the the
easy problems are solved and the hard ones are just a little bit further up the tree there's a
lot of controversy there so that's one certainly one of the explanations is you know we run out of
easy answers another is we're over regulating or we're getting soft and not willing to let people
try as many big changes a lot of different stories but it's only a relatively mild slowdown in
innovation rates so but it is real and worth pondering but you know the prospect of fertility
decline would cause a much larger rate of innovation decline than we've seen over the last half
century that could basically have it grind to a halt that is if the population fell by a factor of
10 then the rate of innovation might fall by a bit more than a factor of 10 and now you're talking
very large changes in the rate of innovation not so you know basically in the last half century
might have seen maybe a factor of two fall in the rate of innovation at most right from a peak in
1960 and maybe half as big now or something that's roughly the magnitude we're talking when we're
asking thinking about a slowdown over the last half century or so but if we have a population
decline falling by a factor of 10 or 100 then we have that sort of magnitude of fall in the rate
of innovation which would be very dramatic and basically mean things slow to a halt
that then you'd have a world of very little innovation and I think that also would make it
less liberal because I think a lot of the liberality in our world has been driven by
innovation and the need for being liberal to promote innovation so that's another thing you
might worry about in the dark ages that could follow a population peak and decline is innovation
rinds to a halt and the world gets less liberal but anyway that the underlying problem that I'm
suggesting is fertility fertility is culture and then we haven't explained what sort of problem
there could be with culture and so the key thing I was trying to note here is that
the very simplest cultural mechanism is just to copy the high status
uniformly without much discrimination that would have been the very initial mechanism of culture
but over time we've accumulated a lot of ways that we can you know make that better by having
better sense of what to copy about who that who is successful in what ways and what aspects of
them to copy all right so high status copying high status might have worked reasonably well in the
past it would be the simplest thing to just do initially the simplest thing to copy yes
but it might not exactly be the the best thing so what can go would be copying right so the idea
is that we've learned over you know many hundreds of thousands of years to copy more specific things
in more specific situations like how to copy someone fishing or how to copy someone making a shoe or
hunting etc we've we've developed ways to judge which things to copy in which context
and that's allowed us to copy things faster and better but there still remains a set of things
that we can't improve that way that we don't have good ways to tell like context specific success
and so those are the things that we're going to still use this ancient mechanism
of just copying the successful but we are still using that and the things we're using it at are
basically our fundamental values or sort of most basic habits
can we nudge culture to appreciate trying to discover the salient aspects of what to copy
say that again can we nudge culture to try and appreciate and value the copying of salient
aspects of context specific it's been working on that for a long time but if you just look at
the most basic aspects of a culture like its attitude toward work or war or children or leisure
or music or you know family or hierarchy and all those sorts of things those sorts of attitudes
are sort of embodied in behaviors and we just tend to copy those behaviors of the high status
people around us and it's hard to know how to make those context dependent right just your most
basic life plans going to college or whatever you're going to do it's hard you know it's grown up
you can see okay the high status people go to college so maybe you should go to college it's
hard to figure out well you know who is succeeding more on the basis of college you know if most
people get married you might want to get married etc but it's just hard to make those strategies
very context dependent based on you know who is achieving what successes from them because you
don't get very good signals of that so for your basic overall life values and you know civilization
values and overall habits we tend to just copy the high status people on those so we're still
relying on this most basic mechanism for much of our most fundamental values most basic cultural
habits because I mean we have to pick something and then we're just following this ancient habit
of just copying the high status folks um so that's the place where culture can most easily go wrong
because it's not using the more refined you know powerful heuristics about what to copy how it's
just going on this very simple mechanism of copying the successful and the generically successful
well I mean I don't want to disport but a lot of people um see a lot of uh you know copy the
status or try and copy the status of you know wrestlers or famous footballers or you know
yes basketballers and things like that and I guess that would have had a lot of selective
advantage being big and uh and being able to throw people around in the ancestral environment
right but it's just a simple right as long as like if there's a footballer and they're successful
then they just count as you know copy the successful now you probably want to be copying
some sort of average behavior of many successful people not just pick one random successful person
but still this is just going to be a deep human habit copy the successful um so but this is the
part I more I think we could be going wrong on so you know copying the best Fisher people I don't
think we have a problem with that I think we you know that works fine copy the best coders if you
want to be a coder the best writers if you want to be a writer yeah that all works great and that
will continue the best AI if you want to be really good at go right for example if you can um
might not be clear how the AI does its thing to you might be clearer how somebody does fishing
right okay so um this habit of copying the successful um works you know is more of a problem
when you don't have good you know finer indications of what to copy how you just copying the generic
successful and another way there could be problems is some kinds of things we copy are tied together
in shared behavior so um some kind of behavior you can just be different from people nearby and
nobody minds like you can like a different tv show or a different style of music maybe a different
way of decorating your couch and within a certain range of variation people don't mind you're being
different and then even for things that it's hard to know how to allocate success that can still
work pretty well because just a lot of people will do things different and you know slowly over time
the better ones will tend to win out and slowly over time the successful people will be doing
those and that kind of still works so even without being very subtle about what to copy if we can
just have a lot of variation in behavior we still get pretty good cultural evolution but there are
some kinds of things that we share norms about where we are going to discourage people from
being different where we're going to have conformity norms especially moral norms so for example on
murder we're not very tolerant of varied behaviors on murder basically anybody who murders we're
going to be down on them and we're going to discourage that now you know that makes sense
for murder of course but the point is cultural evolution isn't doing much to validate that
within a culture because the whole culture shares the norm against murder
and so if if we had a norm against something that was not a good thing to have a norm against
like you know um blinking say we had a norm against blinking a whole culture that has a
norm against blinking then people are just going to not blink and even if that hurts them then
the culture isn't going to figure that out because different people aren't really allowed to do a
different some people start blinking while they're going to get punished and the culture can't figure
out that that was a bad norm the way the culture figures out that not you know a norm against
blinking is bad is because different cultures would compete some cultures would not have a
norm against blinking and they would succeed so when we're talking about the evolution of features
that we can't like figure out exactly context-dependent signs of what to copy and we're talking about
features that are shared across the culture then the way cultural evolution figures out those is
through the competition between cultures not competition within a culture right so that's
interesting i want you to to clearly explain the difference of the so i want to do it by analogy
so think of species um the larger a species is in terms of the number of members the more rapidly
it can innovate within the species because as if anyone part of the species comes up with an
innovation it can spread to the entire species and there's just more places where anyone innovation
could start so some kind of innovation can happen with species within a species that is those are
the features that can vary within a species like if dogs can have bigger ears or smaller ears
then a large species of dogs can more quickly figure out what size ears make sense in its
environment because you know lots of different ear sizes will be tried and then the best ones will
win out but species have features that are common across the species that you can't vary
within the species sort of the basic structure of the species and for those basic structures of
a species within species evolution doesn't find those answers so for that you need between
species evolution that is there are different species that have different structures and then
the ones with the better structures win out over the others so biological evolution has these two
levels there's evolution within a species and evolution between species and there's a trade-off
the bigger each species is the more within species evolution you can have but the less
between species evolution you'll have and that's a trade-off so and for example in the ocean the
habitats tend to be larger so the species tend to be larger they have more members in the ocean
but on land the habitats are more fragmented you know there's forest and mountain and desert
and stuff like that and so they tend to have smaller species and more species and on rivers
they're especially fragmented and in rainforest also especially fragmented lots of little tiny
niches where little you know habitats where life species can be and so there's just a lot more
species and a lot smaller species in rainforest and rivers and on land to a lesser extent compared
to the ocean so now we can compare who does which of these places does innovation better
that is where do species evolve faster and then develop things that then they spread to the others
and in fact the answer is land has been beating the ocean for a while and perhaps you'd argue that
the of the marine creatures that that have that seem to have innovated the most once migrated to
land and then migrated back into the sea like whales and dolphins and things like that right so
a lot of sea creatures are descended from land creatures and more so than vice versa since there
have been lots of land creatures so the fragmentation of land and especially rivers and rainforest
has been a fount of overall innovation that has spread to the oceans and spread to other places
so more total innovation has happened in the fragmented places than in the larger integrated
places the sort of interesting fact about biological evolution which suggests that the
between species innovation actually matters more than the within species innovation
and the same thing looks true of corporate cultures so corporations have cultures
and the about corporate culture of a corporation is actually the main thing that makes it different
and valuable compared to other corporations and corporations cultures change over time
and there's the question you know do they change for the better or for the worse
and there is then evolution of culture and innovation within a company and then there's
evolution between companies so overall innovation in the economy of firms is composed of two parts
one is that each firm slowly gets better over time it invents little things inside and then
spreads them within that firm and then the other is that innovation in the entire economy is also
due to some better companies replacing worse ones analogous to the better species replacing the
worst species see and in fact also it seems to be true that the the competition and innovation
between firms matters more than within firms that is you know in some industries basically
the the improvements you see within a firm are less than half of all the improvements
because the rest of the improvements are coming from just replacing bad firms with good firms
hmm so there are these two levels of innovation within species and within corporate cultures
there's within a unit and there's between units and it looks like in both of these
cases between unit innovation matters more is there any ways in which you'd think more followed
morphological change or morphological innovation might be different enough than cognitive
innovation i mean ideas change a lot quicker and ideas are more valuable and ideas right so
that's why we look at corporate cultures corporate cultures are the idea innovation
so if you doubted the example of species then corporate cultures should be more
comforting to you as an example it's much closer so what we're going to make the question was how
are they different do you think they're analogs it's just one's a lot faster than the other
so corporate cultures are a lot like macro cultures than species are this isn't going to be my
claim because i'm what what we're mainly where we're going to be mostly interested here is in
sort of macro cultures whole societal cultures and corporate cultures are a closer analog to that
than species are but i want to point to both of them as examples that suggest the same thing
they aren't disagreeing in their lesson which is there's innovation within cultures and there's
innovation between cultures and so just like we said the the the norm against blinking say
if a culture has that norm and it just punishes anybody within the culture who deviates from
that norm that culture isn't going to find out that that's a bad norm the way the world will
find that out is some other culture that doesn't have that norm will win out and because it doesn't
have this stupid norm against blinking um so that's the between culture innovation as compared
to the within culture innovation so the thing like copying the fishing you see that's easily
handled within a culture because different people in the culture allowed to fish different ways
and as long as different people can try a different ways and people can see what works then
within culture evolution works great or things like that
but there is also the between culture innovation that is there are these features that whole
cultures share including values for children and light and death and work and family and you know
war and all sorts of things and those sorts of values tend to be shared across a culture
and then individuals within cultures tend to be punished from deviating from those shared cultural
values so in order for those to be set well we need more between culture competition where
different cultures have different attitudes towards children and marriage and work etc
um and plausibly if the analogy works that stuff could be even more important than the
within culture innovation because it seems more important in the case of species and corporate
cultures so then we want to turn our attention and say okay how healthy is our between culture
innovation process the process that would produce you know better choices there
and so for that we want to look at three key parameters there is diversity how many different
macro cultures do we have then there's selection how strong is the selection pressure to
you know pick the better ones and delete the worst ones and then there's third which is
how much do these things just change internally uh you know move away from whatever they are to
somewhere else and all three of those parameters are actually a bit disturbing so a couple centuries
ago say three centuries ago most of the world was full of hundreds of thousands of little peasant
cultures each group of a thousand or few thousand people was actually a relatively isolated culture
who could do things different and often did things different and didn't actually depend
that much on the rest of the world and was pretty near the edge of survival they suffered pandemics
and famines and invading armies and so there was pretty strong cultural selection
i.e if a peasant culture went off the rails and just started being weird about say blinking
then if that made them suffer enough then they would just be deleted and replaced by other local
cultures we wouldn't want to delete whole cultures today they did i mean they just no
they they just went away but nobody was recording them or caring much but yes
and there was so there's lots of variety hundreds of thousands of them and great selection pressures so
presumably these were pretty close to functional right they were if we think of the space of all
possible cultures if they think there are sort of functional adaptive corners of that space they
most of these peasant cultures were probably near those adaptive corners they worked
because if they didn't they got out competed by the other ones
okay now in the last few centuries we made two big changes from that the first is we
replaced little peasant cultures with national cultures so a famous book Peasants into Frenchmen
describes how this happened in France but of course it happened all over the world
these little peasant cultures were forced to adopt national languages they had national schools
national ways of organizing their town national become part of national trading networks national
employment systems they became Frenchmen and were no longer isolated peasants and
that's part of the modern world a world of people who are part of national cultures
which dramatically reduced the number of cultures in the world from hundreds of thousands down to a
few hundred so that was a huge cut and then in the last century half century or so the world has
also been converging among these national cultures to more of a global culture so and this is especially
strong among elites elites all around the world they tend to sort of go to the same
conferences have gone to the went to the same schools when they were young and when I meet
elites from around the world they tell me two things one is that the place they come from
has distinctive styles and cultures that the world should value where they say you know I'm from
Brazil and Brazilians you know they're different in these ways and the world should value these
ways are different but then they'll also tell you that they personally don't embody any differences
that would be a problem they would personally work just fine in any global organization corporation
committee anything so they embody world culture of elites so and you know I think you can see many
ways in which the world differs on the surface but when you get down to deeper values there's
much less variety so for example on policy only one country in the world allows organ sales
which is Iran and the rest of the world is always constantly trying to figure out how
they're going to get them to stop nuclear energy airline regulation electromagnetic
regulation and lots of different kinds of regulations and practices the world is pretty
convergent we saw that in cova definitely very quickly the world elites discussed what to do
they agreed and then the whole world basically did it the same way that the world elites had agreed on
uh so these are evidences that the world's been converging on culture and I think the convergent
fertility decline is dramatic evidence that the world's cultures don't really vary as much as you
might think because the world of you know actually very different cultures some of them would have
much higher fertility and they would maintain that but um you know so far the the only places that
have high fertility are the ones that are still poor and you know there's this long trajectory
where poor nations were high high fertility and then they got lower fertility as they got rich and
so it looks like the few remaining poor places mostly in Africa will probably fall in fertility
as they get rich and you know if you go there and visit they are trying desperately to integrate
in the world economy and culture they you know they want to be like other places and they are
trying to integrate as best they can with other places so these two things that happened are
greatly reducing the variety in world macro cultures um so that's one concern is the variety
is way down now this reduction of variety definitely had advantages by promoting within
culture innovation by merging all these cultures together into a single world economy etc we have
enormously more powerful economic growth you know innovation of business practices technologies
the world's been doing great at getting rich peaceful healthy but all of those things mean
there's less cultural selection you know people aren't dying in so much of famines or pandemics or
invasions so there's really much weaker cultural selection of cultures lately in part because
having so many fewer cultures meant we've really succeeded at this within culture innovation stuff
so those two things should be disturbing they would mean you know by themselves they would
mean we're you know whatever innovations we have achieved before in sort of cultural values
about blinking or whatever we aren't improving them but you might think they're maybe they're
good enough so maybe what we had before we're not improving them but we'll still do fine because
you know the things we had were the result of thousands and hundreds of thousands years of
evolution producing these macro cultures and so even if we've turned off the engine of improvement
of macro cultures as long as they don't get worse maybe that's okay so you still might be optimistic
you'd say okay you know yeah we can't do context dependent culture or copying you know the particular
aspects because you know these are overall culture things we don't know how to judge success for
and yes it's hard to vary them within a culture so you know they need between cultural innovation
but you still might think if we just keep things that we used to have that were pretty good then
that'll probably be okay maybe sometime in the future we should get back to like working on having
more variety and selection to do to learn better about how to improve our macro cultures but
things would be okay now unfortunately it seems like we are not willing to just leave them alone
we also have this surprisingly high rate at which we are changing our macro cultures
and in large ways and ways that aren't plausibly you know disciplined by selection
so you could you know we talked before if you look at my lifetime we've just seen
large value changes large cultural changes that have just well known and not only known but just
eagerly pushed for in fact in our world today people are people get a lot of status out of
being the people who caused cultural change and the winners of cultural fights are gain high status
for being the winners and so there's a lot of enormous amount of energy for people seeking to
figure out what cultural changes they would like to push for and cause
and fighting over cultural change and then being high status for being the people who cause change
and there doesn't seem to be a place where that stops that is we didn't just like fix some problems
and then stop we keep changing and changing and changing for a long time
and from the internal point of view of a culture that feels great
like people really love the feeling of status they get from feeling like I've always thought
culture should be this way and when it was that way I think that was just wrong and thankfully
people like me stood up for ourselves and advocated for a certain change and
and it happened and we're so proud of the world having followed our advice to change culture
this way and we want to push for even more changes in those directions and we're hopeful we might but
there's these other people opposing us and they're evil we're going to fight them and there's just
huge emotional energy wanting to do that within our cultures it's one of the favorite thing
many people like to do is to join culture wars and to push for culture change of the sort that
feels like it's right to them there's a lot of conferences which are
us builders being disruptive events you know this sort of disruptive culture is something
that really is attractive to the younger crowd now if you're just disrupting technology if you're
just disrupting like how you fish or something so we said there's whole areas of culture that work
fine because we have good metrics of what counts for success so we can just copy success so I don't
want to be denigrating at all you know attempts to disrupt fishing or other technology practices
where we have a good outcome measure that will lead us well toward figuring out what's better
you know for example if you want to make cheaper faster computer chips and the whole world wants
cheaper faster computer chips then disrupting how computer chips are made would be great if
the way if by doing so you give us better cheaper faster computer chips right because we all know
we want computer chips and we want them cheaper faster so if we don't have any doubts about wanting
them to be cheaper faster well then sure that's great disruption yeah well there's top-down
manufacturing which at some stage is going to get really really slow at innovating because there's
only so much you can do right at thing with life we might need bottom up right and that's
also right which is all could be great so the the doubts I have aren't about those things because
those are well disciplined by you know knowing what success looks like how to see how to measure
success right what I'm worried about is when we're trying to change cultural things regarding
children or family or you know health versus fun or psychedelic drugs or authority war conflict
you know law police you just there's a lot of eagerness to change our cultural stances toward
those things where we don't have an outside objective metric for what would be better
we just have people feeling like the way we're doing the way people think about us now is wrong
and I feel like this is right and I want to push for a different attitude about that
that's the more risky part from the point of view of cultural illusion because then the
macro cultures won't just retain whatever wisdom they had from centuries ago when we had strong
selection that selected for functional cultures we will instead drift away from that
into unknown directions and if in the space of all possible cultures most places aren't very good
we will go to those not very good places in general in evolution the usual idea is that
there's a vast space of possibilities most of which is bad and the whole point of evolution
is to search in that space for the for the better the small volume subsets that are high value
and try to find those and refine them to get especially high value that's the usual concept of
evolution but if you just start throwing random changes from something that worked you have to
kind of expect it won't work so well do you think that um okay drift and selection aren't mutually
exclusive right they often happen together right so they right exactly and they they do simply
happen together and then there's a relative magnitude with it so if you have a modest amount
of drift but more selection then it won't drift so then when you're driving a car basically
you know that you're trying to keep the car in the middle of the lane or the middle of the road
and there's random things that will disturb that and if you weren't watching the road then the car
would just typically drift off the road causing severe problems typically right so but you have
a selection process a correction process whereby you notice deviations and you push it back toward
the middle so that you can keep on track on the road so you know when selection is strong enough
relative to drift then it doesn't get very far away because selection pulls it back
can you think of any rare cases where drift is actually drifted a species or culture in a beneficial
direction and why well i mean there's just idea of you know getting to another hilltop so the idea
of that you know the evolutionary landscape isn't just single peaked there are multiple peaks so you
need to find ways to go downhill for a while before you can go uphill again and so there's a lot of
ways we understand evolution to give slack and randomness so that in fact you don't get stuck in
local maxima but can search around and find other ones so certainly some degree of randomness and
variation is needed for that degree of larger search and certainly you know that's why you need
some variation not just in exploration to a degree but not so much that it kills you
right but you want to combine some variation with selection if you have variation without
selection you just drift off into random bad places you want variation and selection together so that
you can explore a range of options and then pick the best ones
hmm yeah i find it kind of disturbing that in order to keep innovation going on one strategy
is to keep just just to keep the birth rate up i mean creating more people who sit around and consume
not necessarily contribute to innovation directly they might not even go to work
um in hope is that extra human brain power um and extra humans to to fill the i guess the the
gaps to keep the the the uh the system going the the civilization going so that we can have the
people sitting in labs doing all the experimentation coming up with better ways to create computer
chips or better algorithms for better ai or better ways of governance it's can't be just around
just population growth of course it's not so we could elaborate a more complicated model of
innovation in the world the question is the things that are causing population decline
can they be overcome by some other variations in order to keep innovation high that that's
the challenge you're trying to imagine um you might say well if we accept that population will
decline then maybe we should be searching for ways to adjust other parameters so that we could
retain high levels of innovation in the face of falling population that's not crazy but it is hard
so so one thing to realize is um economists for a long time have understood that innovation is
the most important thing in the economy by far and if we should be figuring out how to promote
innovation as best we can because that's overwhelmingly important and we have studied
different ways to promote innovation for a long time and what we found is the ways people have to
try to promote innovation it's just really hard to make them work we we have consistently failed
to find ways to do very much promotion of innovation we have found some way so for example one of the
best things is research tax credits and you give companies tax credits for doing research and
development that tends to promote more research and development which is good for the overall
economy um other things we try to promote like with patents and copyright and funding government
government funded research and things like that they don't tend to work that well and so we don't
really know very well how to promote innovation another way to think about this is Silicon Valley
say is famously innovative and lots of other nations and regions around the world have
said themselves we want to be the Silicon Valley of X Silicon Valley of Australia Silicon Valley
of South Africa whatever right lots of say how can we copy how can we be like these innovative
places and lots and lots of regional governments have tried to copy whatever they saw as the
successes of Silicon Valley and other innovative places to be innovative themselves and have
overwhelmingly failed people just don't apparently know how to be the next Silicon Valley
they try and they fail so these are warnings that yes we know we would like to promote
innovation but when we've tried to promote innovation we haven't succeeded very well
one of the best things we might think to promote innovation is just do less regulation and the
world's just said no we don't want that but you know one of the most consistent sorts of
recommendations for having more innovation is less regulation and most of the world is
just not willing to do that basically for that purpose so mostly innovation happens more in
the places that happen to allow it where regulation happens to be weak but so the point is it'll be
hard as population declines to adopt policies that correct for that because we already have
enormous incentives out there to be the place the fount of innovation everybody wants to be the
next Silicon Valley and they keep trying and failing to do that so it's just obviously not that easy
to do well I mean I worry that in some regard types of deregulating may lead to more chaos
and the types of chaos that we may end up and may be very dangerous because of the I guess the
technology technological capability that we have today there could be spikes in dangerousness
that could be discovered quite early if we deregulated in certain ways you know I wouldn't
want to see a deregulation of control of biotechnology labs for instance we don't have backyard
experiments going haywire United States was unusually innovative in part because the United
States was unusually low regulation and then a lot of disruption did happen because the United
States went pretty wild so for example the automobile was not something most of the world
was very eager to let go wild but the US sort of let the automobile just go wild and then other
places were pressured to copy the US went wild with say oil and drilling for oil and using
oil for various things that the rest of the world ended up copying that because the US went wild with
that um if you look at you know when the US was going wild with innovation the rest of the world
was hanging back exactly because they were afraid about disruption correctly so a lot of these things
were quite disruptive and a lot of things went wrong when people just went wild building oil
wells everywhere like a lot of damage happened when people went wild driving new cars everywhere
putting them everywhere there was a lot of accidents and things going wrong a lot you know
certainly like the early days of TV we just went wild like making TVs and let everybody watch it
we weren't afraid of all the cultural consequences that might happen and even with social media we
went wild just adopting social media now everybody's worried gee should we have done that but uh yes of
course innovation risks disruption and unexpected harms and downsides absolutely
in some case innovation might uh just um cause disruption uh to such a degree that it
reduces our ability to innovate or startle so of course we don't want to blow ourselves back
into the stone age by going wild right I mean plausibly you might say television reduced people's
attention to reading and to ideas and was a hindrance for innovation overall in society that's
a plausible claim I would think television and radio before it were entertaining and fun but
hindered many kinds of innovation we lost our attention for the physical world and for gadgets
and making things uh honestly I think you can make a distinction between engineering and design
and the pretty good arguments that engineering is a stronger and underlying
fount of long-term innovation but the world has actually switched from more engineering to more
design over the last century there used to be there were a lot more engineers than designers
and now there's a lot more designers than engineers and design is by its nature less
innovative because the innovations it finds are more context dependent so engineering innovations
tend to be able to be applied quite widely whereas design innovations are pretty narrow like if you're
designing a menu system for some app which things you put where on the menu that's design it's
important it matters but when you figure on an innovation there it's in the context of a particular
system whereas if you invent a new material or a new engine or a new you know kind of transport
or a new way to make computer chips or things like that those innovations have much wider
implications they because they are much more general so you could just say allowing our
world to focus more in design has been a hindrance to innovation in a sense it has
but the world is just not very interested in our regulating on that basis actually
so I'm not sure if we really can change that but certainly I'm happy to support any way we could
promote innovation more innovation is overwhelmingly important and there's lots of ways we could try
right so so would you say okay so some of the real strong forms of innovation some of the real
boons we've had recently in technological development I mean the internet we've some forms
of social media I guess beneficial artificial intelligence of course and and just you know
algorithm design maybe there's some boons to be gained in the way that we harvest energy
we get better at photovoltaics get better at battery storage and all that sort of thing
are you worried that you know bad innovation might disrupt some of these
type these really powerful avenues of innovation so just overall just allowing pretty much all
innovation has gone pretty well for several centuries so I might think you could do even
better if you were really good at figuring out which innovations to support and which to hold
back but I might think I'm not sure I trust people to make that judgment well so I think
we do okay with just allowing pretty much all of it so in this discussion I'm focused on the
problem that we've been neglecting macro culture innovations and that that can take down all the
rest that is macro culture innovation because it's not being constrained lately by much selection
and it doesn't have much variety and it has this huge drift rate that it's just going to be going
bad that's a predictable thing we can guess from the structure of the situation and we can also
seem to verify that say in falling fertility that seems a very concrete evidence that exactly this
sort of going off the rails is happening and you know we can even walk through mechanically how
it might be in fact you know we can have a more detailed causal story of that if you want to get
into that of how particular you know cultural selection has plausibly been causing some of
these trends but the more fundamental fact is just that plausibly if you have macro cultures
without go off the rails then you will just get less adapted less functional and a lot of things
will go wrong and that's a key problem we have and then we might want to think well what the heck
can we do about that and it's much harder to fix than merely fixing safe fertility which we
have some actual ways we can do that. Let's just say okay just briefly in the event we have an
overall cultural fail and all we have is smaller cultures around but we want to get back to this
modern civilization culture maybe or something like it what metrics do you hope our successor
civilizations will be able to use to keep alive the good aspects of the failed civilizations
or the the failed cultures. Can we learn from failed cultures because I'm sure not everything
they do is bad right is there is there is there anything that any signatures that we consider
derived from the graveyard of failed cultures of the good aspects of their culture we can use to
feed into ours if if we were choosing our culture and consciously for the purpose of
winning at cultural evolution then we can certainly learn a lot from not only history but just the
nature of cultural evolution and figure out things that would work there the problem is
no one's in charge of culture so no one gets to set culture and even if you could set it it just
keeps changing so that's the more fundamental problem here if you if the problem was only
how could we design a culture that was would work well that's a much easier problem actually
than the problem we face because we face a problem situation where cultures whatever you set them to
any how they won't stay there they keep drifting away that's the problem of cultural drift is
where any world with cultures just won't stay but
how can you prevent them from drifting is the most fundamental problem
now I you've you've written about this right solutions to the problems of cultural drift
right so I could at this moment I can see sort of you I think I've sort of brought it down to
basic categories so one category is to try to just promote a lot more variety of culture
in the hope that with enough variety even the week selection we have might be enough
and with enough variety the drift doesn't matter so much because they just
drift off in different directions and maintain the overall variety
to do that I think we would need something like a deep multiculturalism so in the world today and
in the past there have been people who celebrated the idea of multiculturalism the idea of
encompassing a range of cultures within a society and liking that variety and promoting it but
in fact what people mostly seem to like is what's been called a boutique multiculturalism
where we have a variety of foods and clothes and holidays and hairstyles and songs and languages and
you know ways to decorate houses but we don't have so much variety in the deep values
that are the key things for macro cultures and so I actually so I think Robert Nozick is a
philosopher who's thought of as a libertarian but his book Anarchy, State and Eucopia is really
trying to describe a world of different cultures that could be very different but still share
a larger governments and a larger market and that vision is actually not very appealing to most
people so I did a set of polls on Twitter where I asked about 12 different kinds of
variety in the world and which kinds people wanted more or less of that variety and fundamental
values was the one people least wanted more variety of that they most wanted less variety of that
people don't like the idea that we would share a culture with a governance in a society and
markets with people who had very different values about say gender equality or how to treat children
or things like that people hate the idea of that kind of variety and in fact there's a guy named
Stuntz who was a Harvard Law professor who wrote a book around your 2000 about law the history of
law in the US and he said initially in the US the legal system basically allowed enormous variety
the law could just be different in every little county every state could be different and states
could allow every county to be different and then over over the decades and centuries the law became
much more constraining of this variety through a series of moral campaigns where people just
really wanted to make the whole nation agree with their position on each new moral campaign like
prohibition or prostitution or polygamy or alcohol you know a bunch of things like that
in these situations people felt very strongly that the whole nation had to agree with their position
on that moral issue and that the supreme court made rulings to allow
everybody to be forced to follow the majority's opinion on that and that's and now the US law is
much less open to such variety each local county can't so much have whatever laws it wants because
it's constrained more to follow the moral opinions of the country's majority but that's just what
you expect given that people really like to be in moral crusades where they push for their moral
view and want to push for everybody to adopt it and that's been the driving force of cultural
change and corporate cultural conformity so but that would be one solution if we could get people
behind just tolerating and even encouraging more cultural variety of deep values more cults basically
get everybody to say cults are great let's just have more cults let's let cults do weird things
with their kids and weird things with their work and weird you know weird things with their bodies
make more cults lifeboat that would be one approach that plausibly could work right i mean
people have spoken about like bubble worlds before and bubble worlds with chorus membranes and you
know cosmic sea steds where people could drift at one you know from one culture to the other and
they didn't like it they could try out other cultures right but remember only one country in
the world allows organ sales all right and the rest of the country keep worlds keep trying to
pressure them to switch and that's true for a lot of different policies there's not that much appetite
for wanting to allow experimentation and variety in the world there's enormous appetite for enforcing
conformity or making sure that everybody does it the right way so i mean like we do have organ
transmission though but it's highly regulated and regulated similarly worldwide right sorry
regulated similarly worldwide that's the key thing so a lot of say challenge trials well there's a
maybe one of the issues is it's it's it's opt in for people who die rather than knocked out maybe
the default should be opt out so the more organs to be transferred because that's the problem right
it's just not enough organs sure but again the usual conversation they like these is this sort of
conversation where we ask what's the right answer not how much variety should we allow
or even encourage people especially with medical ethics are not very eager to talk about what variety
we shouldn't allow or encourage they want us to talk about what's the right answer that we
should force on everybody so that's the I mean obstacle yes it's true i mean like there's a
lot at stake um in experimentation here if you have a market for organs you could end up like
you know someplace in South America waking up in a in a in a you know a bath of ice with a phone
saying you're missing a kidney right right that that's the risk of variety yes and so if we allow
people around the world in different multi cultures to have different ways they raise their
children maybe they won't send them to school right maybe they won't have the same attitudes
towards violence uh there's people feel strongly about their shared values and disliking deviance
who have different values but again this is one possibility that we get people to swallow and
accept and celebrate even more deep cultural variety not shallow stuff that's one right i mean if
you let a thousand cults bloom would you want some sort of governance of the cult some sort of super
sort of um overseer to make sure some of the cult don't spin out of control the very minimum what
you would like is a world that could trade and even have some you know peace among diverse
cultures right if they were just constantly at war with each other then you know that would be pretty
sad so you might like them to be able to trade with each other and to keep some sort of military
peace between them so you'd have to like nudge and all to be friendly um but you know it would be
friendly things could go pretty pear shaped if just one of them thought that hey let's go do stay
and our cult right so but the risk is that oblivion like you think well we want a lot of
cultural variety but and then you're going to have a list of exceptions where you're not going to
allow variety on those exceptions now you have to realize that for each of those exceptions you're
not going to have cultural evolution on them and maybe for a couple of them you can gamble pretty
solidly yeah we don't need variations on those we're pretty sure those are right but the more
you add to the list the more you are risking failing to have cultural evolution on those things but
also drift right the problem is they won't just stay where they are our shared world attitudes
towards those things will drift and they could just go off the rails drifting from wherever they are
so that's the risk but yeah that's that approach you you probably will tolerate a couple of ways
that the world shares something so that it can share peace and share trade but you don't want to
risk very many of those because each one is a way in which we don't have cultural selection and
we could have drift okay let's let's drill down into that with the specific
like you know weapons of mass destruction or weapons of potential mass disruption right
yeah so so how do we regulate that such that we don't see drift and uh we don't see that's the
point is you can't regulate against drift of cultural values so you know we'll have to define
what is a weapon of mass destruction and then the world culture will drift in what it defines as
such things it might initially start out as nukes and bio weapons but later it decides its AI and
then it adds misinformation and libraries and libraries become weapons of mass destruction
and then they get to regulate those and you know that's where drift could go
um hmm or how would that work that is knowledge is power and therefore you know
paranormal and to translate exactly that is one person with a very persuasive message could
destroy the world by getting everybody to believe their very persuasive message
and we would we can't risk a persuasive demagogue having a voice to let everybody hear them
and therefore we must regulate against um potential persuasive demagogues
right sounds like a sweeping regulation right there i mean it's not it's not right it's not
what we would adopt initially but the point is you can't constrain where the future will go with that
that's like the problem of because the world doesn't want to constrain it like so the question is
how could you get the world to want to constrain itself from changing
so but my second alternative solution is in the direction of this so maybe we should switch to that
so the my my second alternative solution is to say let's let's have these large shared cultures
try to constrain themselves in terms of their future cultural evolution
how could we get them to do that well we'd have to get them to sign on to something
that they were so devoted to that they saw as so sacred that they were willing to
let it constrain them when they were otherwise tempted to change their values to let culture drift
that's the challenge so so as you know i have this form of government design called futarki
where you pick a metric and then betting markets would decide which policies would
most likely achieve that metric and by repeatedly adopting whatever policies this
the betting market say would achieve the metric you would in fact tend to achieve the metric over time
so if you adopted a futarki about some long-term simple values like the size of the world economy
or the amount of energy we use or the population or something then the betting market
speculators would know that certain sorts of cultural changes would tend to get in the way
of that maybe causing a population decline economic decline and then they would adopt
policies to try to resist those but then the problem is people could just change the metric
when they didn't like its consequences if it didn't feel a very compelling metric to them
because all these cultural value changes tend to feel very compelling at the time
and people feel very devoted to them so the question is how can you have something they feel
as devoted to as that to get them to resist those sorts of drift changes so well here's
an example that might work we can at least think it through imagine we had a futarki
around the metric of the date we get to the stars and there's ways to define that but
that's a long way off okay but maybe we're willing to treat this date of getting the stars as a
sacred thing because this just isn't some economic metric or something this is our cause we we want
to get to the stars we are the community we are the society that is going to get to the stars and
we have decided we want to do that and then the futarki will see that if we allow population to
decline or the economy to collapse then that will put off the date we get to the stars and
then when it can see policies that might reduce those threats it would adopt them
and then when people saw that those policies were pushing against some of their cultural values
they might let it happen anyway because they saw this getting to the stars date as a sacred
thing that trumped their other concerns um i don't know if you know i you know a year ago the previous
year before that i spent the year thinking about the sacred and studying the sacred as a way to
understand it so there so here i'm invoking that and all that kind of stuff right here
some collective repossessence um as sacredness that um sort of guides people's values
and uh yeah well we can go into more detail now i feel like but for the for the purpose of this
discussion the idea is just could we identify or agree on some sacred value that we could we would
be willing to enshrine into governance as the value we were going to pursue together and then
that is resistant to selective pressure say again that is resistant to selection well
that we are just going to not change as a large society that you know isn't suffering much selection
pressure now so we would just adopt a governance structure as the united states or even as all
the west or something where we say this is what we want and this is what we agree to
do and then when it sort of pushes in some directions that we you know that feel a little
uncomfortable or that aren't well matched to our self-concept of what our values are we we
tolerate it because all through history people have been willing to suffer for their sacred
things and they're often proud of that you know when when christianity demands certain things
that they don't feel very natural to you you often felt well this shows my devotion to christianity
because i've been willing to do things that feel uncomfortable because that proves my devotion to
the sacred costly signal and you can get status from it right now i mean i have to admit like
this is also a long shot like getting a large world to agree on some sort of long-term goal
like that that they could you know embody in a concrete metric like the date we get to the stars
that's a big ask of our culture our culture isn't that inclined to pick those things and
make them super sacred um our culture isn't even inclined to say explicitly what we value if we
we mostly tend to have implicit values for things and want to make choices based on our
implicit values and not have to commit to a explicit statement of our values at least
not very constraining one we we don't mind vague description vague statements that are slogans
you know all we need is love something like that or everybody counts or any children of the future
blah blah blah right i mean you know but to actually commit to a concrete measurable metric
that constrains what we value that's something people are much less comfortable with
so when they see the sacred up close they with a magnifying glass they won't appreciate it as much
because there's you know some people don't like an aspect of the sacred you know if you come too
close to the cross uh you might find you know splinters you might find parts that you just don't
like but let's say the date we get to the stars is nicely abstract right the date we get to the
stars is nicely abstract if you are willing to just embrace the idea yeah we want to get to the
stars as soon as possible then you might accept that as our sacred value and willing to make other
sacrifices for it i think it's less that the details of that look ugly than that just it
may not be compelling enough they may not really stand for what you really are willing to sacrifice
for um now for an intellectual like myself you might think oh let's let's make a metric of how
much we know that should be civilization should be devoted for some integral over what we know when
and knowing more sooner is the great thing we all want to do as an intellectual i can get more
behind that that's more sacred to me but um i'm not sure how compelling that would be to most people
but the point is this is the kind of thing you're sort of torn to so this is this is awkward for me
like not only am i more of a STEM person who doesn't want to think about culture i'm also more of a
libertarian who doesn't want to think about empowering a government to you know push everybody
in a direction they don't feel like oh that's what we're talking about here empowering some government
to adopt policies that push us all in a stated direction that may be at odds with what each of
us feels like doing i mean besides these two alternatives the default alternatives is just
to accept that our civilization will in fact fall and collapse until it's replaced by something
like the amish or heredim who are insular fertile subcultures who are not so much suffering from
cultural drift and then a new civilization rises which then has to go through all of this over
again because it'll also drift and can't figure out how to fix it yeah and that they'll be at the
same place we are right right except a little higher the cycle will continue and you know even
if they have the the sacred value of just uh you know bank just having a large population and the
sacred value of fertility um you know and that and that is a drive for innovation they're gonna
reach up hit against resource bottlenecks i mean there's practical limitations to fertility
sure but if you think about say the roman empire there was a collapse of civilization before the
roman empire from the bronze age it was a minimum there there was a higher point of civilization
say 3000 years ago or 4000 years ago and then there was a collapse and then there was a rise
again of the roman empire and then there was a collapse but the low that the roman empire fell
to at the end was still higher than the low before the roman empire began uh there were a lot of
specific technologies that the world had in the poor middle ages that they did not have in 3000 bc
so if our civilization rises and then collapses again it won't collapse to the same place
it was in 1600 i think we'll still have electricity running water sanitation
even and you know electronic communications i think the world would have those things still
even if we lost much of ai or other large infrastructures so the rise and fall of civilization
can still take us higher in the long run it would just be it's just be kind of sad in the sense of
you might hope not to have to go through all these crashes and rises and it becomes harder to
imagine influencing wherever they end up right culturally especially like if our civilization
you could if you know that you're a civilization about to collapse but you do care about the future
of general life um you may decide to try and uh have efforts to preserve certain types of information
in non-destructible readable ways right well the problem is that you need the next civilization
to be willing to pick that up so say we look at the roman empire the roman empire was eventually
replaced by the christians who initially in the year zero say was only a thousand people or so a
little after that and then doubled every 20 years for three centuries to eventually take over the
roman empire but then when they finally took it over they did not keep everything from the roman
empire there are many things that were associated with pagan heathen practices and attitudes that
they rejected because they didn't want to be tainted by those things and plausibly our descendant
civilization may be feel that way about us for example much of our music they might feel that
it embodied the wrong sort of values and they might reject most of our music so even if they
went on archaeological digs and found all these stellar um containing useful information we find
valuable today they might just take a torch to it and burn it so nobody ever get to see it
exactly so i think you have to imagine how you could offer them something that would not feel
threatening to their different valued civilization you know so as we know the amish and the heredom
are reluctant to embrace many technologies in our world they have direct access to them it's not
like they have to dig dig them up but they are explicitly rejecting them because of the fear of
other things that they will get contaminated with if they use them do they burn like evidence of
technologies existing um in their cultures so i mean no they don't need to they just keep them out
right right yeah they just don't use them for example you know i'm just wondering if you know
like uh like the heredom or the amish if in the future they might have museums of of uh
different ideas that different civilizations had that people would go and look at but they they just
didn't use them in their modern society right but it's also that you know a lot of things that
were lost completely a lot of things that were lost from the roman empire weren't lost so much
because of christian hostility because they were integrated into a larger society and weren't very
sensible or understandable outside that context a lot of technology is like that uh it you know only
works in a context and separated from that it's not very understandable or useful so that is a basic
problem of the collapse of civilizations is how to to preserve something you need to make it
less dependent on the rest of the civilization factor it out pull it out from other things
and the kind of technologies that people continue to use at the end of the roman empire were simpler
more separable technologies that you could recreate with very low tech etc um so in the
scenario where you accept the collapse of our civilization yes if you want to think about
the future the main question is what can we do today that would be the sort of thing they would
want to keep to help you know make them speed up so that they don't have to rediscover things that
we could they could just inherit what we figured out and one one issue would be to like keep it
low tech and simple like modern ai technology at least of the form it is today is not a good candidate
here it requires enormous large infrastructure and systems to do right yeah and then well
methodologies like the scientific method might be very useful if they did they completely forgot
that then rediscovered it right so i think you'll want to separate those things from our ideologies
so i think for example a lot of social science or even humanities science will be at risk if
they think they are infected with atheistic attitudes or you know attitudes that are
pleasure oriented or you know heat decadent etc they might wholesale reject
aspects of our intellectual world that seem to be infected by value as they disliked and you know
we can know what those are maybe for today's redam and amish but what they will be in two
centuries or three is much harder to predict and that makes it much harder to figure out how you
can pass something on to them that they would not fear being infected by do you think can you
imagine a future civilization be scared by something like science or the scientific method
would be frightening i think if it had been clearly applied to something they disliked
and it was seen as the justification for something they disliked they might well
so for then they'd need to like then that would need to be preserved they'd need to say the reason
for the previous civilizational collapse was because of science and here's why and so the
the the encoding of the why would need then to be preserved wouldn't it i mean at the moment
they don't have to give very elaborate justifications when the amish decide which
technologies use they don't have to do long white papers justifying it they just have to
have a sense that that would be risky and they want to keep it away so i mean in our world today
they you know in their small businesses they are happy to use machines that you know they buy
from elsewhere as long as they don't need much training to learn how to use those machines because
they don't have to want to send people off to be trained and then mix up with other people
that's why they don't want them to use the internet or you know email so much because
they're afraid of the mixing in the larger culture cell phones or even cars the main
reason they don't use cars is because with cars you can go farther and mix with more people
so they are very attentive to worrying about that mixing and same for the heredim
and so very insular fertile subcultures are going to be in this long-term habit of having
resisted outside influence and keeping themselves insular and then it matters how they define that
in their minds like what is the package of things in their minds that's the risky package that they
want to stay away from and things you think might be valuable could be mixed up in that package but
they can't see it and they're just going to keep a whole package away because the package looks scary
hmm i mean do you think that okay so is there any been been any
i mean it seems as though even the amish like you you may say that the amish are insular
but a lot of people drift out of the amish culture into um they lose about seven percent
per generation yeah right that's a lot well they i mean okay but they keep 93 percent so
they're they're growing rapidly on the basis of that um they aren't very interested in recruiting
outsiders to join themselves same for heredim um but this is again this is a long-term problem
to think about but there aren't very many good answers here so that's the main thing to say
this is kind of discouraging not only is it discouraging to have to admit that all those
culture people were right and there is important things to think about in culture it's discouraging
to not have a solution very easy the solution none of the solutions look very attractive here
and it's even hard to get people motivated to see this as a problem honestly people love their
cultures people feel very attached to them they feel very motivated by wanting to join cultural
fights and to push for their cultural drift of favorite directions um well okay so of the
salient functions of culture that we can see um do do we see them all do you think we're
aware of all the salient function of culture um that that is useful for innovation that is useful
for preservation if we don't and okay so how do we find out what they are so I think if you look
at corporate cultures it's a great microcosm because it's just a lot easier to study corporate
cultures we have a lot of data on them you can go into them and see how they work and I think it's
a good microcosm to help you understand macro cultures um corporate social worlds or complicated
worlds and managers of these worlds have a limited set of tools they can use to influence these
worlds but it's pretty powerful they can fire anybody import anybody any job they can change
budgets they can move around functions managers have a lot of power over corporations but nevertheless
there's this whole set of other things that are happening as a complicated social equilibrium
that they find it hard to see and understand and control and sometimes I just call that culture
culture is all the stuff that the managers can't very easily see understand or control
and in that sense yeah there's lots of stuff that you don't understand there because
it's our name for all the stuff you don't understand and all the stuff you don't understand is
something they in fact can't control very well so managers are very quite often trying to initiate
corporate culture change initiatives they see some problems with the culture and they want to
change it and most of those initiatives fail and in fact on average corporate cultures just drift
into dysfunction and it's selection that mainly fix that that's why corporations just tend to die
over time their cultures drift into dysfunction into maladaption and even with all the powers
and incentives that CEOs have they can't typically fix that that should be a warning about macro
cultures how are we supposed to understand and control our macro cultures when we have less
visibility into them less control of them less powers over them in whoever we give powers has
less incentives it's just a much harder problem to understand and control our macro cultures
compared to a corporate culture and with corporate cultures we usually can't control them and they
usually drift into dysfunction as selection is what fixes them so that suggests that you really
want selection I should mention that with them with the deep multiculturalism you want more
variety but what you want is a combination of variety more variety and less drift so we could
also help that scenario by discouraging drift we might be able to perhaps get our culture to see
drift as risky and not so because many ancient cultures revered their cultures and we're wary
of changing their culture our culture today celebrates changing our culture so could we somehow
adopt a more literally conservative view wherein we were less eager to change our cultures and more
wary of changing them and maybe even more idealized keeping cultures from changing
it that isn't enough by itself but it could be work with more variety together to produce more
selection and of course the third element is more selection what if we just had more wars
or other disasters that caused selection I mean who want I don't want to wish more wars on people
but honestly if you had a high enough rate of wars going on that would in fact be strong
selection that was probably the strongest selection factor for the last 10,000 years was war
I mean it certainly drives a lot of funding for technological innovation in some ways right
it's driven some right but it's still you know a minority of the economy I mean
even in the US defense funding is like more than five percent of the economy maybe three percent
so that's limits how much funding it can be giving for innovation because it's only a
tiny fraction of the economy but and it's less funding for military that it's more actual
it's the actual selection of war that is the would be the mechanism that would
prevent cultural drift but that means some cultures have to lose by losing wars
which would be do you think there's any hope in trying to um understand the the landscape of
cultural possibility and try and etch out what it what it looks like in in in a way um and try to
understand what it is the function of culture that is useful um and and the stuff that isn't
I mean it could help I mean there's certainly no reason not to understand it but
I guess my best bet would be if you could understand the process of cultural change
enough to make that vivid to the people who are pushing to changes so that you could get them to
back off from trying to cause such rapid change so often that would be my best hope is to make
that vivid of course you'd also like to make vivid where is the deep variety and where is
the shallow variety and let people really see you know it's the deep variety that matters more
but people tend to focus when they think about cultures in shallow cultural variety so people
say look how could how could we have a world monoculture look at all the different kinds of
music look at all the different tv shows look at all the different hobbies people have look at this
enormous variety and there is enormous variety there it's just not variety of the kind that
cultures share across the culture like the blinking norms right that's the problem with
things that were allowed to vary on where we don't have strong norms to enforce conformity well
yeah we have a lot of variety in those and those aren't a problem um so if we could get people to
just see that they do have a bunch of these cultural norms that they do share and that
there is low variety of it maybe people could be more disturbed to see how little variety we have
but even then often they're just they love that fact so many people love the fact that
century ago the world had all these different conflicting cultures who had world wars and
didn't understand each other and didn't think well of each other and now the world together
we have mutual understanding and mutual peace and trade and we get together at conferences and we
respect each other and we all agree about the value of education and the value of paying
enormous attention to each child all the time and all and the value of art like we like the fact that
we share a culture and many deep cultural values are shared people like that so the hard thing is
to get them to see that as as a risk as something that has a problem with it
if we did develop like a super powerful AI that would be able to simulate culture
without actually destroying our own in the process maybe we could do some form of indirect
normativity where we have an oracle AI that says hey here are all sorts of permutations
on cultural value that that could sprout off from here and I'm simulating all these cultures
and I have such a huge amount of computational power I can do that I don't I mean I think the
key lessons don't need very complicated simulations it's fine to do simulations more
realistic simulations are better in some sense but the the key lesson so imagine somebody who's
really passionate about say transgenderism right they think in the past people didn't care about
this they had the wrong values about this today more people have the values I treasure but not
enough and I'm really want to push for more valuing you know agreeing with my values on transgender
the question is can you get that person to see that that process that they're involved in is
attaching themselves to a value that's trying to change culture is the thing that's causing drift
in the long run get them to imagine what happens if a hundred other groups like that happened
over the next century each with its own new concept of values each pushing in a new direction
what's the net effect of that on the world over that time that's the thing to get them to see
is to be able to imagine that I don't know you need that complicated simulation to convey that but
even to get people to engage in and see that simulations in their head not everybody's willing
to do that so offloading this the head simulations we do in our little skull brown brains right so a
supercomputer that might be you know smarter than us in many ways and can sort of do a deep sort of
simulation across many different varieties of growth and cultural change and then maybe we'd
be in a bit better position to be I certainly don't object but you know I'm a I'm an economist
I'm a social scientist in a world where people sometimes do simulations and it's actually honestly
hard for social scientists to do simulations to get the attention of other social scientists much
less the public because there's just so many different ways to interpret a simulation so many
different choices you might have made so many different ways to frame it it's hard to convince
somebody that this was a robust simulation it wasn't just the outcomes weren't as a result of all
the particular choices you made and to sort to get the answer you wanted that's hard to do among
social scientists who are willing to look at a lot of the details of these so there's a much
bigger challenge to get ordinary people to believe and be persuaded by the results of computer
simulations of society I'm just going to tell you that it's even hard to get ordinary people to buy
a simple game theory argument about yeah society and it's just much way more ways to be skeptical
about a computer simulation because most people disagree with the simulation theorists the social
scientists in the game theorists or maybe that's a cultural change we need get people maybe social
scientists or game theorists and but then you also have to make those people actually tell the truth
as opposed to tell whatever is in the interest of so honestly much of social science is in the
service of various activist groups that are trying to push for various cultural changes
rather than trying to check those people in discipline they were often see themselves
literally in the service that that is they see their highest goal is trying to push for some
kinds of social change many social scientists are in that mode that's what they're trying to do
so getting even social scientists to be wary of that and to understand this risk of cultural drift
is a big challenge right I mean a lot of social science probably can't be really tested in
in the real world unless the experiments are played out but what aspects of social science do you
think could be more amenable to empirical testing such that they they would have to be believed if
they could be proven replicated obviously the the academic literature and the concepts I'm most
drawing on here for the discussion I'm talking to you is the literature of cultural revolution
cultural revolution is still a relatively small part of social science it doesn't have its own
discipline for example you know and the first simplest step would be to get the specialists
in the field of cultural evolution to to be the one saying what I'm saying instead of me to use
their authority as a specialty field who knows the most about cultural evolution to say to the
world yeah we have a problem with maladaptive cultural change and to be willing to say that
and explain it to people and to then they can use all of their evidence that they've been
persuaded by internally to convince themselves of all the particular views they have on cultural
evolution then to try to persuade other social scientists and then the rest of the world about
this key problem so I've talked to some relatively elite people in cultural evolution and read them
and they seem to know that this is an issue and agree with it that is what I'm telling you isn't
some radical view that isn't roughly known by cultural they know that cultural evolution could
go wrong they know that there are in fact signs that cultural evolution has been going wrong lately
they do get less variety and selection pressure is a problem with evolution but they've just been
shy about saying this to the public that is this is still a small field they're trying to they crave
respect they don't want to be you know saying things that might get pushed back that might get
people complaining about them which makes sense so yeah I understand yeah they've all got no
livelihood to protect and they all got you know their peers that they want to appeal to and they
don't want to lose friends and things like that sure they don't want to back up against
sacred values because that could you know end up you know hurting them but I mean I think you know
as a futurist you can see that to the extent this is right a lot of analysis of the future is kind
of missing the point if this is actually a key dynamic that's likely to play out then it's going
to delay a sidetrack many other futurist visions of you know what we will be doing and accomplish
in the next century or so there's an aspect of this that just doesn't sit right with me and that
is this this sort of big unknownness this big cloud this obscurity this you know you must trust
selection pressures but for things that you just don't understand but my default sort of means of
sort of solving that is to try and understand what you don't understand do you think there's just a
sort of like just aspects of all this that will never ever be able to understand
like this so here's a dynamics of cultural drift and dynamics of cultural change you think there's
just pieces of it just will never understand we'll always have to trust the selection pressure
I think we might well understand enough details of culture to talk sensibly about how you might
design culture if you were allowed to to be functional that's not crazy but the question
is who will ever let you do that design culture that is so one view of history is that humans
first evolved reason and then we evolved culture and under that view culture is something we only
ever do when it makes sense because we use reason to figure out when to say copy somebody else's
behavior under that view culture couldn't be going off the rails because cultural changes are all
produced by reason applied to some complicated context where we then figure out who to copy how
and what to change so if our majors world cultural changes were primarily due to reason because
reason was the underlying mechanism people had and culture was just a way reason was expressed
then we wouldn't be having a problem here the view of the cultural evolution people is not that
the view is that reason was developed after culture culture made reasons we first have this
underlying mechanism for copying and doing behavior and then we we figured out that reason was a nice
behavior to copy and we figured out ways to use it and when but we didn't let it replace
all of culture and take it over it was something we used in certain times and places and as you
may know that we often use reason to justify things but not to choose things so it shows that
reason actually has a relatively limited application in our world although we
try to pretend like we apply it we try to do that with like empirical studies I mean if something
it's something to bad study we have meta science and like right that's all using reason I'm including
all of that in reason looking at data and analyzing data and drawing conclusions is all reason but I
mean it's been junk science which has been subsequently thrown out sure because the methodology
was bad right but look so I am a economist who has specialized say in the topic of governance and I
I know that and mechanisms I know many ways in which you know economics seems to support
ways we should change our institutions but the world isn't interested in these ideas because the
world really isn't interested in believing what economists say about how to change institutions
that is the world in many ways just isn't that interested in listening to pointy head
talkers about their abstract ideas and changing behavior on that basis that they tolerate them
to teach their kids to be impressed and we get selected by companies but they don't actually
want to do what they say so even if we can get a detailed analysis of culture and its structure
and what it causes the question is could you actually get people to change their process of
cultural change on the basis of that analysis that's analogous to sort of changing our government
from what we have now to futarki on the basis of listening to analysis of people like me saying
yeah that would work better but nobody wants to do that nobody is at all interested in listening
to academics tell them how to change the structure of government because nobody wants to change the
structure of government on the basis of abstract ideas that's not something anybody's interested
in really really I have a bit more faith than you perhaps I think people do listen for reasons
arguments and change based on them but not everybody it's a slow maybe it's a slow process
and I'd like maybe it's a much more process and you'd like for example you know the specialists
in the field of economics of medicine have known for a long time since you know at least for
50 years now basically that on the margin medican medicine has very little health benefit
and so we don't need to be spending as much as we do on medicine because the marginal effect of
medicine is very low we've known that for a long time and the world just doesn't want to change
its behavior about spending a lot on medicine on the basis of that abstract academic analysis
so that's a pretty simple direct thing but so that's my experience you see
embedding myself in the world of ideas and analysis and realizing that you have pretty solid
arguments for ways the world should change in the world just doesn't listen it doesn't care
and people are much less sensitive about that than they're going to be about culture
people are going to be maximally sensitive about culture when they have a moral campaign
they're on and they want to change the world on the basis that moral campaign I don't see
what sort of abstract analysis they might listen to to back off on that moral campaign because
they really love that and they think it's the most important thing and they think it prompts
everything else and that there is no possible argument against it that's how people feel about
moral campaigns yeah I guess because people don't ground morals in real world phenomena
they just assume that what they are is what they are well they have some way they came to them but
they aren't very aware of exactly how that happened but once they have this in their mind
it feels very compelling that it's just obvious yeah well that's the start point of your analysis
here it's like you believe very strongly the values that the culture that you're embedded in
tells you right and if you don't you may be selected out right the culture will punish you for
not embracing its values and they just seem obvious right I mean but the thing is what you did is you
copied the values of the prestigious people in your culture the high status people that's the
most fundamental thing and then when high status people said it should change then you copied them
too you didn't I mean it's it's made you don't just stick with the culture you were taught when
you were young you're willing to change the culture you taught when you're young on the basis of
the prestigious people in your in your culture telling you it should change
unusual is besieged people are telling you to change because it's in their interests
or they're just doing the same thing they're following the same cultural strategy as as you are
right because there are some at some point there was somebody else who was prestigious and they're
copying them again the fundamental mechanism of culture is copying success and the simplest
unconditional strategy is just whoever is high status you copy them and yeah I mean like is it
I mean it's becoming more high status to be able to change based on new evidence and change based on
you know scientific findings and all those sorts of things and that's a good sign in a sense that
like part of part of what's popular is the ability to change based on evidence but people almost
never want to change their values on the basis of that evidence they only want to change their
beliefs and facts and and what what actions have what consequences well I hope not oh well I hope
that gets better right I hope that the lessons do we actually have an argument for this so this
look I can give you another real if I'd say yes so I mean the key thing is this cultural analysis
and by evolutionary analysis will basically tell you what will survive and what will exist in the
future and then people often say but I value this and I don't care if we exist in the future so many
people when they see the conflict between our current cultural values and the fact that our
civilization might decline and be replaced by the others they say fine let's be replaced
that it's more important that we stay true to our values than that we prevent our civilization
declining and being replaced right and they take the rest of civilization down with them okay that
would be scary that is very that is the most common instance here within within the culture
select out that kind of way of thinking
we don't want to have a I've heard of many times selected out because of that way of thinking
I think you more have to convince people that there's a modest amount of they don't have to
give up that much of their culture that it is only a bit that they have to give up true
um is it almost time for you to have yeah it's about time for me to go home yes I quite a good
impression but yes it's getting uh well I guess we're above two hours now but um it like is there
any thing you'd like to um sum up with is there any like a conclusion or or um you know I think
I've definitely gotten to say plenty of things here I don't feel I haven't gotten to say how
my say uh so I just say look this is only something I've been thinking about for three months now
so I've got to admit a lack not on the expertise of somebody who's been at this for 30 years
and so I am a little bit puzzled why the other people who are experts in cultural evolution
haven't been saying this before me there are people have been doing this for many decades
although maybe they think they have said it it's just hard to get the word out um it's doesn't
look easy to fix um and all the plausible fixes just look pretty hard and but nevertheless
it's a problem we face and so you know I feel like what else do you do and figure out what are
the biggest problems and bang your head against them as best you can so that's what to do here
well been wonderful having you again and it's certainly a very interesting topic and I really
hope that could be more achieved here whether more progress can be made on on this front
and I look forward to hearing more of what you have to say once you've had a lot more time and
a lot more people get to weigh in on this for sure um I hope we'll talk again about it I guess
yeah all right well thanks um yes and uh you have a wonderful dinner
you
