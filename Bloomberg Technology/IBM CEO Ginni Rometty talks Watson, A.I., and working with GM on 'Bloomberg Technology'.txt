I'm Emily Chang and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up Tesla shares jump
after smashing estimates the electric car maker reports a rare quarterly
profit plus IBM CEO Ginny Rometti joins us live we will dig into Big Blue's bet
on Watson and the new partnerships with Slack and GM and our conversation with
Steve Balmer the former Microsoft chief weighs in on Twitter's future ahead of
earnings Thursday he's also a big Twitter investor but first to our lead
Tesla shares take off after the company posts a rare profitable quarter its
second in Tesla's history as a public company adjusted earnings per share came
in at 71 cents versus an estimated 54 set loss adjusted revenue also beat but
beyond the financials investors are listening closely to the call with
CEO Elon Musk particularly for more color on his controversial plan to merge
the company with Solar City and create a one-stop shop for clean energy products
shareholders get the chance to vote on that plan in just a couple of weeks
joining me now for more our Bloomberg View columnist and auto industry analyst
Ed Niedermeyer and in New York Axiom Capital managing director Gordon Johnson
who covers Solar City and I want to start with you because earlier this year
we got our hands on an email from Elon Musk to employees saying quote it would
be awesome to throw a pie in the face of all the naysayers on Wall Street who
keep insisting that Tesla will always be a money loser is this a pie in the
face of Wall Street and is it just one pie or will there be more pies yeah I
think that's the that's a good way of thinking about it it is it is clearly it
is a pie in the face of Wall Street but I how many more pies he has left is
unclear I think one of the things that was really important in pushing them
over the line to a profit this quarter was the ZEV credits from California those
are those are essentially going away and the color that I heard from Mr. Musk on
the call suggests that it's not clear how they're going to repeat this in the
fourth quarter although he is saying that they will repeat it they did boost
production they made 25,000 cars which is almost twice what they did last year is
that sustainable oh yeah I mean they have to keep ramping up production the
real big yeah yeah no I believe they can up to up to a given point I've done some
research into the permits for their factory I think there's a limit in the
short term and potentially in the longer term until they file for new
environmental permits but that's that limit is significantly higher than where
they are right now it's more like 250,000 units so up until that point I
think they're good investors also excited about free cash flow right now
176 million dollars why is that a big deal well because it hasn't happened
before and yeah it's an important thing again though I mean I think you know you
look at the valuation of the company and if this is you know what a profitable
quarter looks like for them you know how does that right how much how much cash
are they really going to ever return to investors manufacturers a low volume
business this is a great a huge accomplishment I think they pulled out a
lot of stops to make it happen and they got over the line but it's not like
they're you know generating huge amounts of cash here and I think that that's
something that looking down the road you have to wonder will they ever reach a
point where they're gonna really return a huge you know throw off a lot of cash
for the business all right Gordon I want to bring you into this of course you
cover solar city and solar city shares are up following Tesla shares does this
mean that shareholders are more likely to approve a merger well I think I think
the shareholders are I have always been likely to approve a merger I mean if you
look at the merits of this deal it just doesn't make sense the core the core
basically concept of this deal is you're gonna marry rooftop solar technology
with battery technology storage technology but the whole premise and the
whole tell when behind rooftop solar technology is the ability to access net
metering i.e. storing your power in the grid if you bring in a battery you
essentially eliminate that dynamic so the merger doesn't make sense from that
perspective and just real quickly on Tesla's results keep in mind we talked
about the 140 ZEV credits but they're also guiding the street to a 35% lease
rate and it came in at 32% the street was changing their models that was also a
big benefit in the quarter and we know that there was big discounting so again
as was stated earlier I don't know if these results are repeatable and with
respect to the deal the merits of the deal never made sense and one other
thing that's worth note is when you had Evercore come in and do the valuation on
this deal they didn't even have solar city or Tesla's financials before they
gave the okay and put it three to five percent terminal value on this deal so
it's like they were in the dark and they gave the okay there were three other
bidders who didn't match Tesla's bid for solar city so it's aggressive I think
Elon Musk takes it takes a very Machiavellian approach to business you
want him toiling around but you don't necessarily want him doing it with your
money and you're smiling and nodding yeah well I think one of the things that he
didn't mention was actually that cap X is reduced I must just said on the call
that they're gonna ramp that back up in the in the fourth quarter as they start
building up the model three launch I think a lot of investors probably assumed
and fans of the company assumed that a lot of that ramping has already started
happening and I think the fact that they're coming in under guidance by about
half a billion dollars on their cap X that that they're behind on that and
yet Musk says there's no impact to the model three you know production which
is already a really really aggressive schedule so that's something we're gonna
you know have to watch closely Gordon we're expecting Tesla to unveil its solar
roof product on Friday what sort of an impact are you expecting from that on
the potential merger I don't think it's gonna be a big impact look which we're
tracking California solar initiative data as well as investor owned utility
data looking at applications for net metering and advocate applications
for rooftop solar there's no doubt the US market has taken a nose dive this year
just six months ago ASPs average selling prices for modules in the US for 65
cents you're talking about 40 cents right now there's been a big drop so the
demand in the US market and the US solar rooftop market is suffering right now as
the utilities are winning the battle the net metering battle and I think that's
gonna weigh on all the rooftop mentors including solar city if you're a Tesla
shareholder and you're voting for this deal I got a question you know your
sanity I think essentially you're following Elon Musk into the void and
we think that's just what it's gonna be it's gonna be a void of cash flow eating
essentially Tesla's cash flow I don't get it Tesla and Elon Musk also ramping
up their plans around autonomous driving I spoke to Sebastian Thrun who
basically invented the Google self-driving car was very excited about
what Elon Musk is doing you know saying that a new generation of cars Tesla
cars are going to be fully autonomous but there are still questions around the
existing autopilot feature you recently wrote a column where you talked about the
number of deaths related to autopilot and there's some contention around that
clarify what exactly you were trying to say yeah so I wrote in the column that
you know several people have died and and you know Tesla came back and asked
me to correct that to two and I think it's important to clarify that two is
the number of deaths that Tesla doesn't contest there have been a number of
crashes in which you know there's been some question where what the owner says
and what Tesla says the data says you know are in conflict and I think it's
important to understand that you know Tesla does not provide owners with
copies of the data which for event data recorders under legislation in the US
you're supposed to and they say their their data collection system just doesn't
meet the definitions of that and the other thing is is that they don't provide
a commercially available tool so none of Tesla's claims are been verified by
third parties so I as you know someone who writes these columns I'm totally open
to corrections and and and to you know third-party verification of what I
report I just wish Tesla played by the same rules all right Ed Meenermeyer
Bloomberg columnist auto industry analyst Gordon Johnson of Axiom Capital
Management thank you both staying on the earnings front group on shares
sliding after hours after the deal provider announced it's buying former
rival living social group on said the amount of the purchase is not material
the transaction should close next month it was once valued at six billion
dollars in 2011 group on also posted a loss for the third quarter but met
analyst estimates coming up IBM chairman and CEO Ginny Rometti joins me live
from IBM's world of Watson conference in Las Vegas her big bet on Watson ahead
also ahead former Microsoft CEO still Steve Ballmer known for sounding off and
he says Twitter is the best way to do it he'll make the case for Twitter's
independence later this hour this is Bloomberg
on Thursday but the company's bumped up its release time to before the bell
departing from its usual time after U.S. markets close this on the heels of our
Bloomberg scoop that Twitter plans to fire about 8% of its workforce as the
struggling social media company prepares to go it alone for the time
beating we caught up with Twitter investor Steve Ballmer the former CEO of
Microsoft and Ballmer Group co-founder got his take on the company's road ahead
his take very important given he's an investor in Twitter and Microsoft among
very few other things take a listen to what he had to say I think Twitter is an
irreproducible asset just think even you know what goes on Donald Trump
tweeting out late at night everybody wants to talk about it I don't think
there's any vehicle that lets you speak broadly to a mass audience any better
than Twitter could the product be easier use of course the product could be
easier to use and I think that's an important area could the product
benefit from additional innovation that takes it in surrounding areas yes the
cost structure that leases rumors they're working on it I have no information
that anybody else doesn't have but I see a lot of potential in Twitter so do you
see Twitter having a future as an independent company I think Twitter would
be great as an independent company and I'm sure there are acquisitions that
would also make sense for the company the product and shareholders anything
you've heard about you know I read but everybody else reads in the paper if you
will and we'll see what happened what about going private going private is a
distraction I you know in my opinion I think the company would be better served
to put its energy into innovation then all of the work it would take to go
private interesting we've also we've heard rumors about you being interested
in buying the company we've heard rumors about various Silicon Valley
heavyweights getting together to buy the company any truth to any of that so no
truth to my interest in buying the company none and do you have heard
anything about any others wanting to buy the company nobody's reached out to me
that's for sure what about Jack Dorsey having his two jobs do you think that's
a good setup I think it's easy to question people would obviously including
me like more out of Twitter CEOs clearly divided in the way Jack spends his
time certainly as a shareholder it would be reassuring to me if he was
entirely focused on Twitter and also as a former CEO I mean you know how hard a
job that is is it really possible to be the CEO of two public companies and do a
good job it's not possible for me to comment I've never tried it has he ever
calling being a big shareholder has he ever called you and asked for any
advice I do speak not to the management team once a quarter after earnings I
certainly share you know opinions that I have as they come up and they listen to
them and I wouldn't say they solicit advice that would be incorrect what do
you tell them well I call them the same things I just talked to you about
product innovation real opportunities simplifying the product real
opportunities cost structure do they have it where they want it to be those
kinds of things okay so last question on Twitter as one of their biggest
investors what would you like to see happen with Twitter would you like to
see them stay independent would you like to see them sell themselves what would
you like to see I'd like them to see them work on the things they need to do
from a product and cost structure standpoint and be open always open to
opportunities to be independent but also to make a sale if that seems
appropriate how excited are you about the live streaming aspect I mean the NFL
games presidential debates I think it proves the power of Twitter how it
actually works out from a business model perspective I think you know we'll
learn but I think it shows the power of the of the brand and the asset my
conversation there with Steve Ballmer former CEO of Microsoft be sure to tune
in next Sunday 9 a.m. Pacific 12 noon Eastern for my full conversation with
Ballmer on Bloomberg Studio 1.0 of course he is also now the owner of the LA
Clippers this Sunday don't miss Vinod Kosla founder of Kosla Ventures always
full of controversial things to say you don't want to miss it coming up we
head back to Las Vegas to IBM's World of Watson conference and speak with slacks
CEO Stuart Butterfield
the secretive Silicon Valley startup Palantir technologies may be heading
towards an IPO CEO Alex Karp said the software company is well positioned to
go public Palantir has previously valued at 20 billion dollars and Karp says he
expects to reach profitability by next year lately Palantir had seen increased
employee defections over compensation backlash and its reluctance to go
public and turning out to another major tech exit on the horizon snapchat
trying to raise as much as four billion dollars in its IPO this according to
people familiar with the matter that could value the company at about 25 to
35 billion dollars our Bloomberg technology executive editor Tom Giles joins
me now for more so snapchat is going for it they are going for it after this
year of IPO drought they're really gonna kick off 2017 with a bang four billion
dollars on the high end is what they're looking to raise a valuation that would
be in the 25 to 35 as you mentioned this is pretty ambitious given that the
last time they raised they were in about the 18 billion dollar range so I mean
what you're looking at is a company that's really optimistic about its
prospects it's optimistic about its evolution this is the company that
started out as this you know fun disappearing text that got used for
some sexting and for things that you didn't want your kids involved in we
sort of banned our kid from snapchat for a while but it's really evolved it's
becoming much more of a media platform much more of a destination much more
useful to marketers for example they're innovating and creating new types of
advertising tools that you can use you know you can add filters politicians
have really glommed on to snapchat as a way of getting their message out
clinton's on there Trump is on there they've realized that this is important
for getting their message and marketers are seeing the same thing and snapchat
is moving into these other areas like the glasses video they're taking your
video clips and compiling them into this kind of rough draft video of events
around the world so again been a really big evolution for snapchat and it's
filled with exclusive content whether it's a snap from a presidential candidate
or a new treatment on a story from any number of media organizations and you
actually have to be on snapchat to actually see that content and engage
with it and if you don't it goes away right that said so much of this is so
new what makes snapchat so it seems almost like they're in a rush well I
think there's a few things maybe that's because everyone else is moving so
slowly when it comes to the road to IPO right I think about it I mean there's
not a lot of there's the impetus to stay private for so long is not going away
these companies you know uber is talked about we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
we're gonna drag this out as long as humanly possible there's at some point
the investors the venture capitalists who have been putting money into these
companies they're looking for an exit you know I am not privy to the
conversations between snapchats vcs and the company's management and their
bankers but you have to think that of all of my investments I'm a venture
capitalist Silicon Valley so many of my investments are staying private for a
hell of a lot longer I want somebody I want an exit somewhere I want somebody
to get out there also don't forget employees they want to be able to you
know the cost of living in San Francisco in the Bay Area is really really high
they want to buy a house they want to start their kids in private school
whatever it is some employees are looking for exits management are looking
for ways to unlock some of the value that they've been sitting on some of the
earliest investors in snapchat light speed ventures benchmark partners
benchmark of course and bill girly also investors in uber right and it's so
ironic that uber and Airbnb are businesses that are at least valued much
more highly and yet they are still waiting in the wings right exactly and I
mean look something to bear in mind too that in by some measures snapchat is
doing better than Twitter a company that's been publicly traded for a long
time just in terms of pure numbers and engage in some measures of engagement so
you know it's it's actually at the point you know they're looking at revenue of
350 million I mean they're at the point where you start to think about them as a
more mature company as a company that's ready to get out there and a company
that's ready to take in a lot of money as we said four billion you there's a lot
of snapping that can happen using four billion dollars a lot of areas expanded
to with four billion dollars all right Tom hang on I want to ask you a quick
question about Apple shares slid Wednesday after the company reported
fourth quarter results on Tuesday Apple boosting its sales forecast for the
holiday season to between 76 and 78 billion dollars beating most analysts
estimates some thought it should have done even better in light of rival
Samsung's massive note 7 recall analysts on Bloomberg earlier today explained the
stock reaction take a listen what investors have been asking for of Tim
Cook is make Apple grow again and I think that's what we finally saw in this
outlook it wasn't modeled it wasn't in our estimates and the outlook in terms of
revenue for the December quarter is excellent as investors think about their
confidence in the iPhone business it should have been boosted last night I
think the reason why the stock is down is that simply expectations ran up over
the last two weeks for example B of a was out with a call just before that they
would guide to 81 million iPhones for December and in fact they guided above
the street at 77 or 78 but below some of those whisper numbers and so I think
that the our perspective is that look at the big picture the iPhone franchises
intact it's going to return to growth and should stay in growth mode for about
the next seven quarters which is about as long as you can see in a tech company
one thing is clear that Apple is no longer a growth company we have to look
at it as a value company and the way we've looked at it as we've looked at
the intrinsic value of Apple and what what it has is it has a very loyal
customer base which is actually growing not at the pace as we would like but
it's growing it's growing install base and they remain loyal and they spend
more money with Apple on a bunch of different products now I did speak with
Apple CFO Luca Maestri yesterday and I asked about the Samsung issue and he
said that they simply could not tell just how much this has actually impacted
them at this point I mean we're talking only a week two weeks of the actual
quarter and you know what he said is we've already been seeing so many Android
switchers to the iOS platform it's difficult to know at this point but you
know presumably they'll have more information by the end of next quarter
but what's your take well there was a little bit of disappointment that
they're not making more hey they're not capitalizing this or at least they're
not expecting it at this point Apple can always surprise us right this could be
a great holiday season for them it is too early no this is a projection they
don't know if it's that revenue is going to be 76 78 billion it could be much
higher than that they are being conservative now the thing you have to
remember is Samsung is going to come back with a vengeance as soon as they can
get that aid out and you've also got to remember in China where there was a lot
of declines for Apple in the last quarter in China they've got they've got
to deal with a lot of low-cost competitors we've been talking about this a
lot and that's an area of great concern so that's another wildcard that you
got to take into consideration for the for the Christmas quarter revenue in
China down 30 percent year over year for Apple okay Tom Giles our executive
editor for tech thank you so much for stopping by coming up IBM chairman and
CEO Ginny Rometti joins us live from IBM's world of Watson conference in
Las Vegas her big bet on Watson just ahead this is Bloomberg
I'm Mark Crumpton you're watching Bloomberg technology let's begin with a
first-word news 2016 has been the deadliest year for refugees crossing
the Mediterranean headed for Europe according to the UN's refugee agency at
least 3,800 people have drowned many of the refugees were attempting to travel
from Libya on the North African coast to Italy in Calais France migrants set
fires to a refugee camp before police moved in to relocate them authorities
then dismantled the shanty town known as the jungle the people are being moved
to centers around France where they can seek asylum an Egyptian court has
upheld life sentences against the leaders of the country's now outlawed
Muslim Brotherhood and 36 others the appeals court rejected appeals from the
group's leader Muhammad baddie debt sentences were also upheld against 10
others the case dates back to July of 2013 in the aftermath of the military
led removal of Islamist president Muhammad Morsi a new report finds that
of current trends continue the global gender pay gap won't be closed for
another 170 years the annual study by the World Economic Forum also finds the
pay gap has reverted to where it was in 2008 after peaking in 2013 the US ranks
45th on that list global news 24 hours a day powered by more than 2600
journalists and analysts in over 120 countries I'm Mark Crumpton this is
Bloomberg it's just after 6 30 p.m. Wednesday here in New York 9 30
Thursday morning in Sydney my colleague Paul Allen has a look at the markets
Paul good morning good morning Mark let's start as always over in New
Zealand where the NZX has been trading for 90 minutes now and already looking
pretty good up a third of 1% and Nikkei futures are looking mixed and we are
expecting very modest gains here on the ASX at the open and at the open we will
be closely watching shares in National Australia Bank just announced full-year
cash profit up 4% to 6.48 billion that beat estimates are still coming under
pressure from bad debts though bad debts up 7% and net interest margins
contracting by two basis points a 99 cent dividend coming out of National
Australia Bank sticking with bank earnings the markets going to have its
first chance to react to Bank of China which came out with the third quarter
earnings after the close on Wednesday two and a half percent rise there to 6.2
billion dollars for the three months to the end of September later today more
earnings from China Construction Bank Agriculture Bank of China and the big
one Samsung at third quarter I'm Paul Allen in Sydney more from Bloomberg
technology next
this is Bloomberg technology I'm Emily Chang IBM is teaming up with Slack GM
and Teva Pharmaceuticals as the company expands its reach of its Watson
artificial intelligence technology IBM has placed a huge bet on Watson being a
big part of the company's future the announcements all coming out of the IBM
world of Watson Conference in Las Vegas where IBM CEO Ginny Rametti joins us
now with more Ginny thank you so much for joining us it's great to have you yep
thank you Emily nice to be here so you're announcing several new partnerships
today Slack GM Teva Pharmaceuticals just how many more people will Watson touch as
a result of these partnerships yeah we just we just had a great conference here
in fact over 20,000 people world of Watson and as I just told the crowd I
said right now Watson already touches hundreds of millions of consumers and
by the end of next year we're on a path to be a billion it will be a billion and
that is through you just mentioned Emily some of the customers that we're
partnering with so you mentioned General Motors now coming out in the 2017
vehicles on Star Go which is a partnership with Watson about really
using your time in your vehicle in a very personalized but safe way or Teva
which is all about changing the Teva by the way for those who don't know it's
the world's largest generic manufacturer and what we're doing all around making
the whole process in kind of delivery of drugs in a different way with Watson
and you talked about Slack and we had just announced by the way last week the
work now out in available with quest diagnostics which really does make
precision medicine available to almost everyone in the United States let's
start with the GM partnership bringing Watson to the road give us an example of
how Watson will be powering a new driver experience so this idea and again keep
it simple but it's interacting GM has got in about 1.5 billion pieces of
information from connection and you individually permissioning what happens
here so the car gets to know you and everything from you have a prescription
to pick up for your children on the way home telling you where to get off early
when to go get it to preordering paying for your coffee to another example would
just be look you're going to run out of gas getting you to the right place
paying ahead of the pump for you to get your gas and it just goes on and on from
there so this is just the beginning of it and in fact there are a number of
partners as part of this first round coming ExxonMobil you've got MasterCard
Parkopedia a whole number a whole group of partners you could see more being
added on but in a very permissioned way so it just changes that experience
because people on average in their lifetime spend 38,000 37,000 hours in
their car tech companies from Apple to Google to Uber are vying for control of
the car what makes you think that Watson and IBM GM plus IBM have something
special that other technology companies can't replicate well in this case using
Watson in the artificial intelligence can't replicate it and therefore GM has
got data that can't be replicated either and by the way others have different
kinds of data of their own that can get used so I can see us being able to play
a role across many different parts in auto and we do today by the way so
whether it's Daimler car to go or what's work we've done with Honda on batteries
there's many different places that this type of cognitive intelligence will
come into play and it isn't just autonomous driving we do participate by
the way on autonomous driving with subsystems in the car so this is a whole
continuum of opportunity that's out there and they'll be all different forms
whether it's ride-sharing autonomous driving your own own car and there'll
be a very wide variety of ways you'll participate now you say that Watson is
differentiated because every client basically gets their own individual
version of it and that as I understand it IBM won't own or use that data why is
that important and what advantage does that give you over other companies like
Google like Microsoft like Amazon that are pushing hard on AI yes it's a no
look as you as you know we've been building Watson for quite a period of
time and in fact a decade before we even did Jeopardy and now in this five years
how far we have come and we really made some strategic decisions that make
Watson the AI platform for business and knowing what matters to business and in
every business you've accumulated a lot of information it's yours so its value
is yours the IP is yours but so should be the competitive advantage so we've
made a choice of an architecture where we'll bring data we'll bring Watson and
algorithms and you bring your data but the insights go to you as the client and
we're able to separate those so they don't train the base platform and you
make choices on that into a client that's extremely important because there
isn't a client in any industry that isn't going to have as the basis of their
competitive advantage be this information everyone we know and so this is
perhaps in my mind not just mine clients eyes one of the most important
decisions we made now Jenny you've been hard at work transforming IBM and
Watson is a huge part of that how would you rate evaluate your progress so far
given that as we all know transformations in tech are not easy
yes well and you know we're 105 we are the only one that has made it through
multiple transformations in multiple areas of technology and I'm proud the
work of 400,000 IBMers and just last week when we did earnings you saw the
strategic imperatives they're now 32 billion dollars in size 15% growth 40
percent of IBM and you'll find Watson is a silver thread not only through those
but you'll see it in many parts of our base business if you look at our big
technology services business the largest in the world much of what they're
doing is porting clients to the cloud and Watson's a piece of that so IBM at
the same time has several legacy businesses in addition to these new
businesses that you're pushing into and investors still seem to be focused on
these legacy businesses how should we think about you know the performance of
these legacy businesses versus your newer businesses over the the short term and
the long term yeah Emily and you know one thing is I don't think of them as
legacy businesses we've divested of a set of businesses that we thought were
commoditizing and better with others but the businesses that we have these are
really important core franchises that we run and if you look at our global
technology services business our systems business these are really important
parts have been modernized many times they may not be in growing markets but
modernized for whether it's blockchain mobility security and have Watson be
part of them so they're really an important piece if you look at what we do
for running the banks of the world the airlines of the world the manufacturers
of the world so they work together and the announcement with GM is a good
example of that we've been doing work out of our global business consulting
services unit for a long time on on-star and so that served as a platform and
knowledge as we then moved into what we did here with on-star go with Watson and
so they are related together and they're just two different markets different
growth rates so what we call the strategic imperatives businesses that
are we're either building they're new and now clearly at scale at $32 billion
and 40% of the company and the other businesses our core franchises while
may not be growing are very important businesses they're profitable businesses
they're solid businesses together now you've ramped up acquisitions and a lot
of these acquisitions in part to build up data and boost the power of Watson is
that something and a strategy that we should expect to see continue yes in
your right we've done a good number of acquisitions and in fact over the last
two years 25 acquisitions and how we look at them is example for Watson health
that is an industry that would benefit tremendously from data data that you had
the ability to reuse anonymize and reuse and so you saw us acquire companies
like Truven and Fytel explore us and merge ways to train Watson so that is
all for Watson health on the other hand you would have just seen what we
acquired a company called promontory which is the world's most expert group
in compliance and risk and financial services they'll be training Watson as
we've launched Watson financial services so where there's information where
there's expertise because you're really changing industries and you're changing
processes you need those skills you need that information as well as just the
technology itself and that's a really important differentiator for what we do
all right IBM CEO and chairman Jenny Rometti live from the world of Watson
conference in Las Vegas Jenny thank you so much for joining us we're also going
to be catching up with Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield coming up next after
announcing this big partnership with IBM this is Bloomberg
back to the IBM world of Watson conference in Las Vegas where Slack and IBM are
teaming up to bring Watson to Slack's global community of developers and
enterprise users with the computing capabilities of Watson developers will
be able to create more bots and conversational interfaces joining us
now Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield Stuart every time we talk about bots I feel
like we're adding new words to the dictionary some people don't necessarily
even understand what this means in practice but tell us how this partnership
with IBM actually changes the user experience for Slack users
I would love to so there are a couple of simple ways one of the ways that we're
going to be integrating Watson technologies into Slack in a very
direct way is to increase the capabilities of Slack bot which is a
friendly bot that helps onboard new users into Slack and answer questions
that's just kind of scratching the surface right now there's thousands of
developers who are creating applications for Slack for customers to use to
interact with systems for business workflows processes that they use
you know things in the one hand like submitting an expense report or setting
up a meeting time and a lot of those right now are very dumb they're useful
but they're dumb and to the extent that we can help developers leverage
Watson Watson technology to make those applications smart to make a meeting
a meeting scheduler that understands the precedence of people understands what
kind of means can be shuffled around and do a much better job so kind of
approaching human level intelligence in these very simple applications so if
you're using IBM AI then what is Slack building in house and how do you decide
what to build in house versus what to bring in from outside well the surface
area for these I don't know what we want to categorize them as like intelligent
technologies is really really broad we have a group in New York called search
learning and intelligence and there's still a lot of value obviously in simple
keyword searching and so we're working on that and improving the technology there
and we're working on things that are pretty particular to people's use of
Slack so things like recommendations on channels that people should join or
channels that people should leave where I think there's a there's an
intersection and where we can really collaborate with the IBM team is on
things like summarization of information you missed while you were out helping
you catch up from a day of travel or you know if you imagine a really capable
and intelligent chief of staff who was able to read all of your messages for
you and kind of distill it down to the few things that really matter today
maybe make some proactive recommendations for things that you should take care of
you know I'm lucky enough to have someone like that but even she's not capable
of reading every single message and Watson powered bot is theoretically capable
of that and we're making some nice progress now and we have big expectations
for the future now Slack is seems to be a target these days you've got everyone
from Microsoft and Facebook trying to do what you do let's start with Microsoft
they're reportedly trying to take you on they've got some of the tools in place
already like Yammer like office like Skype do you have any concerns about
that we welcome the opportunity to compete I mean one of the challenges we
have frankly is that this is a brand new category and not everyone knows about
it so I think Microsoft kind of giving its seal of approval and this is the
category is actually going to help us quite a bit we you know if you ask our
customers what did you use before Slack 80% of them say nothing even though
obviously they did use tools for internal communication and you can imagine
what kind of challenge it is when we come into brand new companies where people
have no idea what they would even use this for I believe in our ability to
produce a product that people truly love and people list Slack as a perk in job
descriptions we have this kind of organic growth which is usually unseen so here
at IBM started off with 5,000 people using IBM at the beginning of this year and ended
up with 30,000 and that wasn't because we pushed that's because people love the
product and they find genuine utility in it and therefore spreads so I think
they're gonna have to compete on that basis of building the products that
people truly love and do you have similar feelings about Facebook's new
product workplace this is something that they've said they've been testing in
house for two years they're touting AI and look Facebook does a lot of other
things like Microsoft does as well but they're still Facebook well you know I
don't know if you ever seen this photo of 1977 era Microsoft when they're all
hippies and they look all crazy and no one thought that they could take an IBM
in the operating system business but they were very successful there and IBM is
still a very successful company and then Microsoft went up against Google on
Bing and they put a lot of money and a lot of effort into competing on search
Microsoft still a very successful company but wasn't able to catch Google
on search and then you have Google pouring everything they got into trying
to take down Facebook on the social side again Google you know toggles as the
either first or second most valuable company in the world but they weren't
able to catch Facebook on social and now you have Facebook going up against
Snapchat so the moral of that story as far as we're concerned is if you're a
large incumbent you have many lines of business and you're going up against a
small capable startup that has a lot of traction it's very difficult for you to
compete. Moral of the story also I hope you're taking lots of pictures for
posterity last question Stuart Slack is clearly getting traction but often times
that traction is among individual teams with in larger companies and different
teams and different companies use different things how do you overcome
that challenge because if not everybody is at the company is using it then
certainly you're not seeing the full power of the advantage of using your
product. Yes I think as we move to the enterprise product which will be coming
out next year but which we have a couple of larger customers including IBM's
beginning to test we're starting to see the benefits that come from the whole
company using it but it has always been a product for teams and that is still the
core of it and a team can be five people it can be 15 people it can be 50
people you know when you get to 50,000 people it's only a loose metaphorical
sense in which they're a team so what we want is something actually a little bit
different which is the ability to have multiple overlapping teams people can be
have memberships in multiple there can be shared channels and you can create
any kind of organizational structure you want but there's still a huge amount of
value even inside a large organization for a team of people which could be like
you know a business unit it can be a functional area it can be an office
location to be using Slack just within their team. Okay alright Slack CEO Stuart
Butterfield fresh off a new partnership with IBM joining us from Las Vegas thank
you Stuart we will be right back this is Blueberg.

Microsoft kicked off his Surface 2016 event the tech giant announcing a new
all-in-one PC called the Surface Studio that may be aiming to take on Apple's
iMac. Microsoft also announcing a new Surface Book Computer and an update to
Windows 10 that focuses on creative features joining me now to break it all
down IDC chief research officer Crawford Del Pratt so what would you say the
highlights? Well clearly the bell of the ball was the Surface Studio they're
going after the iMac 5k it is a pricey device it's a device that's gonna be
priced somewhere between $2,900 and over just over $4,000 depending upon
features but the single the couple things Microsoft are doing is they're
leveraging touch which is something Apple is not willing to do and doesn't do
in their in their OS or in any of their desktop devices having said that what
Microsoft is also doing is you know they're leveraging premium hardware and
they're starting to integrate features only available on Surface which is a
trick that we've seen out of Apple it's a trick that we've seen out of Google we
saw it on the phone with Google Assist now they brought a product called
Surface Dial which is a way for creators to navigate very quickly that only works
on Surface devices so you're starting to see Microsoft sort of leverage the
power of the Surface to give you that integrative experience. Now talk to us
about how what they're doing fits into the broader context of what's
happening in the in the PC market because you know we've talked about
potentially hitting a bottom and then it seems we're not hitting a bottom. Exactly.
Yeah so I think the PC market is at a you know it kind of important
function point we're starting to see that demand particularly in commercials
starting to recover a bit and I think that what Microsoft is doing is they're
going to leverage their ecosystem so I think that the Windows Insider program
them bringing 3D paint which is a way to experience and scan 3D devices two windows
will allow a broad range of users the whole Microsoft ecosystem to start
experiencing 3D. What they're also starting to do now is they're going to
integrate that 3D capability into office so we believe that by 2021 augmented
reality will be used in 35 percent of connected meetings in an enterprise
environment to sort of help people collaborate in new ways starting to
disrupt the web conferencing market you know the three billion dollar web
conferencing market. We believe this is the beginning of that trend Microsoft
is taking the power of office and they're integrating 3D the next phase will
be integrating augmented reality which they also announced today they
announced low-cost augmented reality devices available from PC leaders like
Hewlett Packard, Dell, ASUS and Lenovo. So you know again you're starting to see
that we know we'll see that hardware next year and new kinds of experiences
around augmented reality. And just quickly we only have 30 seconds.
Apple's expected to unveil a new lineup of laptops and Macs tomorrow.
Do we think any of these things are actually going to change the direction of the PC market?
I think that yes the the short answer is I think that the PC is relevant it's not
going away it is the number one creation tool and it's about refreshing and
updating the platform and that's really what we're seeing.

I want to begin with Russia and the U.S. relationship with Russia.
The Russian new and ambassador said in the last week that relations are
as bad as he's seen them in the last 40 years.
Um characterize the U.S. Russian relationship.
Well it's not uh it's certainly not as it's uh you know peak by any stretch uh we've had
a lot of difficult issues don't really in you know Syria Ukraine just uh just a name too.
Um so it's uh a stress time for the relationship I don't know that it's uh
you know worse than uh times I can recall.
