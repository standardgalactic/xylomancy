When I was in school, I wondered, like many others, what happens in between the different
forms of graphs of elementary functions. How does this become this, become this, or become this?
And what's the deal with the Pac-Man-like behavior around division by zero?
It made no sense to me that these wildly different shapes and features have nothing to do with each
other. There had to be some hidden metamorphosis between the integer powers. And there was,
extending the domain and range of these functions to complex numbers does give us a much deeper
insight, but we no longer have the luxury of graphing two values against each other in two
dimensions. We're stuck with either abstract algebraic answers or slices of the story akin
to taking x-ray images of a cocoon caterpillar turning into a butterfly. I was never quite
satisfied with that, so today's video will be taking a somewhat unorthodox approach
to indulge the intuition of my younger self. We'll introduce complex arithmetic as it's needed
and draw almost everything in glorious uncomplicated duty. The goal is to watch the wings of the
butterfly form and grow. I hope you enjoy. Let's first just see what happens if we start with
f of x equals x, the simplest possible linear graph, make the first power of x explicit and
vary that power up to two in discrete steps. The negative side seems to be jumping up and down
and disappearing in between. Let's look at a few specific examples. For x to the power of one and a
half, we only get a graph in the first quadrant where both x and f of x are positive. Both the
domain and range of this function are real numbers greater than or equal to zero. This is because x
to the power of one and a half is actually x to three halves, which is a square root of x cubed.
For negative values of x, x cubed will be negative and when that negative ends up under a square
root, there won't be any real value dancers. So right off the bat, half of our shape is missing.
In this case, we can still recover it because it's just the other square root. There are always two.
We can get both by treating our expression as an equation instead of as a function.
We'll write y equals square root of x cubed and then square both sides. That gives us y squared
equals x cubed and the graph looks like this. It's just the piece we've already had reflected
about the x-axis. Let's just take that as it is and move on. What about x to 1.4? Again,
we make sense of this by turning the exponent into a fraction, in this case 14 over 10 that
simplifies to seven over five, which makes f of x the fifth root of x to the seventh power.
The power under the root is odd, so it can yield a negative, but that's okay since the degree of
root is also odd and we just get negative results out. We also don't have to deal with multiple
roots since there is only one odd degree root of a number in the reels. This shape does look like
a slightly bent line and intermediary step on the way to a parabola, but the left side doesn't look
like it has any intention of bending upwards. Let's keep exploring. What happens at x to 1.6?
That's 16 over 10 or 8 over 5. So same story with the odd degree root, negatives are allowed,
but this time it doesn't really matter since under the root we are raising all numbers to an
even power, 8, making them always positive. That gives us a shape similar to a parabola,
but it came out of the blue without following any pattern from the shapes we've seen before.
So there isn't really a smooth transition between the first and the second power. The
negative arm of the graph jumps erratically between the three remaining quadrants. And we
didn't even try to plug in an irrational power. That's a whole other can of worms we won't be
opening today. Why is this so messy? And why is all the mess happening when x takes on negative
values? It turns out that negativeness is a part of a much bigger story where numbers can shoot
off not just away from each other relative to zero, but in all other directions too. I have
a whole video about that, a link should pop up in the top right corner, and it's also available
in the description. Raising negative numbers to non-integer powers can have the effect of
breaking down negativeness and taking numbers away from the real line altogether. Let's do a
quick rundown of what these so-called complex numbers are and how they work. All the real
numbers can be arranged in an order on a line relative to zero. We get complex numbers when
we define another direction for numbers orthogonal to the reals. This forms a two-dimensional plane
and specific complex numbers are points on this plane. All the reals are of course included,
but there's also all these other numbers above and below the real line. Numbers that lie specifically
on this new vertical line are called imaginary, and they are the same as reals in every way except
for the direction in which they are spanning. Just like negatives are equivalent to the positive,
except for the direction. And just like a unit of movement for positive reals is one and for
negatives minus one, imaginary numbers also have their own version of the number one, called i,
that happens to point at a right angle away from the real line. So any number on the complex plane
can be expressed as a combination of real and imaginary, like x and y coordinates of a point
on a regular coordinate system, and we express this combination by adding them together.
An example of a complex number would be 2 plus 3i, and you can think of it as walking away from
zero, first by two in the positive direction, and then by three more in the imaginary direction.
This also works as you would expect in the other quadrants. What can we do with this?
Within the regular reals, we have this concept of absolute value, which gives us the magnitude of
a number independent from its direction. The same thing exists for complex numbers,
but this time we have a whole circle of infinitely many complex numbers that are the
same distance away from zero, and therefore all share the same absolute value or magnitude.
And this is what we'll need for our journey today. Instead of considering just positive
and negative numbers, we'll be plugging in the entire range of directions for each magnitude,
and tracking what happens to them as we vary the power we raise x2 in our expression.
By doing that, we are extending the domain and range of our functions to complex numbers.
Two coordinates go in, two coordinates come out. This is not as simple as drawing a line,
basically all the points on the plane map to some other points also on a plane,
and we can't plot them against each other because we can't draw in four dimensions.
This is where the unorthodox part comes in. We're going to compress the behavior of the
complex valued function onto a single complex plane. Let me walk you through it.
We'll start by taking the function f of x equals x squared and importing it into the complex plane.
We do this by redefining it as all complex numbers z of the form z equals x plus f of x i,
so actually x plus x squared i, and for now we'll just use real inputs for x.
This keeps the shape exactly the same. Only now we have the advantage that we can also plug a
complex number in for x and see where the value of z we get ends up. Let's first see what this
looks like and then we can talk about what's going on behind the scene. First we'll take all
complex numbers of magnitude one. We'll start taking them from the real value of minus one here,
going around through the negative imaginary half of the circle to positive one, and then back to
minus one around through the positive imaginary half. All right now we draw the z values in the
same order. Watch the bigger complex plane on the right. The curve we get starts at the regular
point of the parabola for x equals minus one, travels to the regular point for positive one,
and comes back to x equals minus one another way. Let's do the same for x of magnitude one half.
And now we zoom in a bit and fill in magnitudes between zero and one.
You'll notice that for magnitudes of one and one half which were drawn twice,
the curves appear a bit brighter than the rest. In this visualization curves drawn over each other
enhance brightness. Let me remove them and dim the axes so we can observe where else this is
happening. We have a bright spot right here and it appears exactly where the curve for
magnitude one half formed the kink. This is the focus of the parabola. We'll mark it with a white
dot. Now remember we're getting this by plugging the function into our expression for z shown on the
left and graphing the values of z on the complex plane for chosen ranges of x. The main thicker
shape that coincides with the graph of the parabola we got from real values of x and the colored curves
from plugging in a series of complex values of the same magnitude ranging from zero to one.
With this established we can play around with the function. I'm going to extend it to a general
second degree polynomial. By changing the b and c terms we can move the parabola. So let's vary
them just slightly to see what happens. Don't worry about specific values we're using for b and c,
this doesn't really matter. All right the shape formed by the colored curves is starting to turn
but the bright spot we found still follows the focus. Flipping the parabola by changing the sign
of the a parameter also doesn't disturb that property. This gives us an opportunity to vary
the a parameter gradually back from minus one up to one and watch the parabola transform between
downward and upward facing. In between it will hit zero making the function linear so we'll get
our first chance to observe a parabola transforming into a line and vice versa. Let's take the whole
screen for that. Okay the focus gets launched out, the curves reform into concentric circles and then
the focus reappears from the other side reassembling into a mirrored image of the whole setup.
It may appear as if the focus detaches from the bright spot phenomenon formed by the curves
but this only happens because we've drawn the curves for a very short range. If we increase
the range like this they will follow along longer. If we were to extend them to infinity
they would keep following along. The focus travels along this straight line aligned with this feature
that looks like a ray formed where the curves intersect themselves. We're seeing a hidden
layer of the behavior of the parabola pop out and now that we're a bit more familiar with this way
of graphing and how it behaves we're ready to go back to the experiment we started at the beginning
of the video. Varying the power we raise a single instance of x2. We'll start with a simple f of x
equals x and for this regular line the curves formed from complex values of x would just be
concentric circles like we've seen before. Let's remove them and take the power up a notch to
1.1. Now we have two lines on the negative side. What's going on here? Let's draw in
just one curve for x of magnitude one again starting at minus one and going all the way back
around to minus one. We started with minus one and ended with minus one but somehow our curve
didn't connect back to itself. How is this possible? I'm sure you've heard of the famous Euler's
identity the one that states that e to the i pi equals minus one. This is actually a special case
of representing a complex number in terms of magnitude and an angle. The full form would
look like this. So a complex number z given by this expression would be m distance away from the
origin at a theta angle in respect to the real axis which means its real and imaginary parts
could be obtained trigonometrically like this. The famous special form of Euler's identity
is just a complex number of magnitude one and an angle of pi radians halfway around the circle.
And here's a catch. We can hit that same spot where the number minus one lies with an angle of pi
but also with an angle of 3 pi or any odd number of increments of pi and we can go the other way
around too. Remember I've shown you that when we pick the complex values of x we put into our
function we started minus one and traveled this way around to get back to minus one again.
The way these values are generated behind the scene is that we're ranging the angle from minus pi
to pi. The round bracket on the left just means that we're only including values strictly larger
than minus pi because this ensures that every point is represented only once. Why this range in
particular? It follows certain conventions in complex arithmetic but long story short you could
say it's the range that gives us the nearest of the infinitely many representations of a complex
number we can get in this form. We reach all angles with an overall minimum amount of travel from
the angle of zero. Now let's look at raising a complex number in this form to a power. The
exponent is going to distribute. It's going to affect the magnitude normally like it would any
real number and it's going to multiply the angle. Now we can finally examine the case of our function.
We were raising minus one to the 1.1 power. We'll do it first as the angle of negative pi.
Okay the magnitude we can get rid of because one to the power of anything is just one and we'll bring
the 1.1 next to pi so the angle is easier to comprehend. Now we do the same for the angle
of positive pi. These two expressions end up in different places on the complex plane and escape
our initial constrained range. One overshoots a bit into the positive imaginary side and one into
the negative. Neither of those two numbers are real. They are both detached from the real line.
If we were drawing the graph of the function in an ordinary way these values and generally all
the values for negative inputs of x would simply not be shown. But we're not drawing the graph of
the function. We are instead, remember, showing numbers of the form z equals x plus f of x i
on the complex plane. And these numbers exist for any input of x we can think of at least
for functions we've considered so far. In the specific case of our function this results in
lines on the negative side slightly deflected from each other. All right enough background.
Let's fill in some more curves and slowly crank the power the rest of the way up to two.
Okay let's look at that again rolling back to one and again to two. We can see the results for
negative x values rejoin each other as we reach the next integer power. And in doing so wrapping
the span between the negative and positive sides over itself to form the focal point.
Let's push this model a bit further. How does x squared become x cubed?
Looks like the focus that already existed survives and another one forms through the
same wrapping back onto itself motion. But there's a problem. There is no such thing as a focus for
the graph of x cubed let alone two such points. This is where the geometric definition of a focus
and the behavior of our system go their separate ways. But never mind it looks interesting so
why don't we crank the power up some more. Let's go to x to the fourth power.
And then to fifth. Right it's making less and less sense to think of these points as foci.
We get them in areas where the graph of the function bends but also elsewhere seemingly
unrelated to what the graph is doing. But if we add lower power terms to the polynomial so that we
express all the possible extrema the points will travel to align with them. I increase the range
and density of the curves so you can better see these features. Pause here if you'd like to take
a closer look. This phenomenon of curves splitting between integer powers and joining at them has
to do with roots. Any non-integer power is really a combination of a root and raising to a power
like we've seen earlier. Let's write real numbers a bit more explicitly using Euler's identity.
Positive real numbers can be represented by any angle that is an even multiple of pi
because all of those are on the real line on the positive side of zero. Two pi is one full revolution.
Likewise negative real numbers can have any angle that is an odd multiple of pi.
Multiplying those angles by a specific integer always yields one definitive location on the
circle no matter what choice of k we make. If we multiply an odd number by 3 it will always be odd
no matter which odd number we chose. And if we multiply an even number by any integer at all
it will stay even reflecting the fact that positive numbers stay positive under any integer power.
We have multiple representations of the same numbers but we get the same result under
exponentiation with integers. However if we multiply those different angle representations
by a fraction we get different results the most familiar which is the case of one half the square
root. The one half will make the period cycle just one pi which means it will sometimes be even
and positive and sometimes odd and negative. We get the two roots of one and the same happens
for any positive number. There's quite a lot of nuance here and we'll explore it by driving
our graphing method further down below the first power. Let's again first just go down a notch
to 0.9. Here we see a similar separation happening like before but this time the lines are not
crossing over each other they are instead opening up a gap between them. Let's follow this down to
0.5. One half the square root. That gives us half of a parabola turned on its side. The lines for
negative values of x got compressed onto the negative side of the real axis with a bit sticking out
on the positive side and that bit is exactly touching the focus of this half drawn sideways
parabola. The proper focus is back. How about we add the negated version of this function in as well
and complete the picture. Right the parabola is now fully reconstructed along with the same
shape of curves we got for x squared and we also got this extra bit that looks like the
handle of a pitchfork. Of course this is not the actual graph of the function you see on the screen
we're doing this z value shenanigans and cherry picking which parts of it to show. I'm gonna leave
it up to you to ponder on why we get the pitchfork handle here. Meanwhile we continue our descent
down the powers and things get even more interesting at our next stop. One third or the cube root.
Just doing what we've done before we get to this picture but there's something off here.
This function does actually have real outputs for negative values of x. If we drew it the regular
way it would look like this a perfect and complete inverse of x cubed. That's because within the
reals there is only one cube root of a number and it's always the same sign as the number itself.
So why do we get this other picture instead? We have to look at complex exponentiation again
to find that out. To keep it simple we'll again just consider the general positive and negative
cases for the number one expressed using Euler's identity. It works the same for other magnitudes.
First we have the positive case e to the power of 2k pi. We raise that to the one third power
which gives us two thirds k pi. As we iterate k we get the following angles and then they repeat.
Only one of them this one is a real number and it's positive. For the negative case we'll get
two thirds k plus one third all times pi. As we iterate k that will give us these three angles
of which again only one is real this time negative. The way we draw our graph the positive side gets
represented by an angle of zero that stays zero so we get positive outputs for positive inputs
and everything just looks normal. But on the negative side we're coming in with angles of
minus pi and pi which give us the positive and negative one third pi angles the two complex ones.
That hints at there being two more versions of the graph we could draw to complete the picture
just like we had an extra one to complete the square root sideways parabola. We can get these
missing two by multiplying the function with a unit turned one third of the way around the circle
like this and then one more time like this. So let's draw them one by one separately at first.
This is the one we already saw and then we get this one which completes the real valued graph
and gives us the continuation of the two negative sides. But notice how the curves
for complex values just end up in a vacuum not connecting to any of the thicker lines.
Their new home has been defined by the previous stage. Here's both of them together.
Finally we get this one that for some reason just contains the funny separated lines without any
part of the real graph. These are in fact the solutions we've already seen for complex values
of f of x they just all appear in the opposite order. And here's all three together.
I know this looks messy there's too much going on in this picture but there's an amazing elegance
hiding behind it. First let's just notice that we've again fully reconstructed the shape of the
colored curves for x cubed. And now let's just focus on the thicker lines depicting results
for the real valued inputs. What we're actually looking at are three copies of the x cubed shape
pressed onto the complex plane in a manner similar to what flowers look like when they're
physically pressed onto a page of a book. To show you what I mean by that we'll briefly change
perspective. Let me hide the graphs and we'll go back to the familiar coordinate system where
the horizontal axis represents x and the vertical f of x. Now we slightly upgrade it. We'll declare
the vertical axis to be just the real component of f of x and add another axis going directly
towards you for the imaginary component of f of x. We can get away with using three dimensions
here because we're only considering real valued inputs for x so it's a mapping of one dimension
to two. And now we draw our three graphs again. This is what they look like in the space we've
created. We can look at the whole resulting shape as three cubic curves.
Turning the coordinate system around to face straight down the x axis we reveal the three
planes these curves occupy. We see that these planes are offset from each other by a third
of the way around the circle. Note that we are measuring the angles going from the positive
side of one curve to the positive side of another. Now when we look at our simplified model again
we have a better idea what the shapes we're seeing actually represent. We've just compressed these
rotations into a visual deformation a sort of fake perspective in two dimensions. We're not
seeing the true picture but there's an amazing amount of symmetry preserved. These three curves
when inverted represent graphs of three regular cubic functions and all three of these functions
when run through the same z expression we've used this whole time yield the exact same shape
with the quasi focus points appearing in the same places.
So we've made a long pit stop at the third route but it's time to move on. We're going to put
multi value in this behind us again to have a simpler image to look at and make our way towards
the next interesting power zero. Of course that's just a straight line through one. Let's look at the
journey between the power of one and zero again. Two simple straight lines separated by the thick
woods of multi valued routes in between them and as we approach the power of zero we can see a
discontinuity form the dreaded zero to the power of zero. Going even just the tiniest bit under
zero of power results in values approaching the vertical axis exploding to infinity. So we have
this situation right over the power of zero and this right under it. There is something remarkable
happening at the singularity when both values are exactly zero and to understand it we'll consider
the limits as we approach it from different directions. The most commonly considered ones are
x to the power of zero our function itself as x goes to zero from the positive and negative sides
which both work out unsurprisingly to one. The same happens if we simultaneously approach zero in
both base and exponent. The negative side limit only exists if we allow approaching from complex
numbers but it's there. If we fix the base to zero and approach the zero power from the positive side
we also unsurprisingly get zero but if we plug any negative number in the exponent
forget the limit we get this peculiar mathematical object called complex infinity.
Its formally used symbol is just the regular infinity we're used to but I find this confusing
because it can easily be mistaken for positive infinity. Wolfram Alpha uses a notation with
a tilde over it to make it more distinct and I will adopt that. So what is this beast?
To understand it we need to consider how zero works in the complex world.
In the reals zero is the only number that isn't either positive or negative and in the complex
world since there are infinitely many directions this ambiguity encompasses all of them.
Zero is basically a circle of radius zero in the complex plane its direction is undetermined
which in some sense means we need to consider them all when operating on it.
Raising this number to any negative power turns it into division by zero which is commonly left
undefined but within a special set called the extended complex numbers that is complex numbers
with this omnidirectional infinity added to it this operation is actually allowed since it yields
a single definitive answer. That means that our singularity goes through a kind of big bang.
The infinitely small circle of zero instantly becomes an infinitely large circle a place where
all complex numbers regardless of the direction they were headed out in will meet.
Keep that in mind as we travel down to the negative one power.
At the end of this journey we get a familiar function x to the negative one power better
known as one over x which has this property of looping back from infinity around the x value of
zero. Well now you know where Pac-Man went and where he's coming back from. Along the way we're
passing multi-valued routes just like we did on the positive side and finally we form the two
foci of the hyperbola in a similar way like the single focus showed up for the parabola.
There's a lot more to say about these phenomena but i'm going to leave that for another time.
This inverted version of the behavior we've seen on the positive side
continues on down to the lower powers like this.
I suspect all this stopping and restarting we've done might have felt a bit frustrating
so what I want to do now is to just let the animation run from minus four where we currently
stand back up to five so you can see the whole story come together and since we're done explaining
we'll crank up the range in resolution to make it more pretty. Here we go.
I hope you like this journey. If you'd like to play around with this model I've included links to
Desmos graphs where you can fiddle around with the parameters to get a feeling for how this model
behaves. Links in the description. As a bonus let me show you some other notable examples
visualized this way. The exponential function x to its own power and back over constant one to
my favorite Gaussian function the normal distribution and let's enhance it a bit
and then we go back over the exponential function and we draw e to the ix
which we remember to be cosine x plus i sine x so if we just stake out the i sine
we get the cosine on its own.
Thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed and learned something new.
