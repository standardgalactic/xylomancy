This is a topic that is probably my favorite topic of all the things we're working on.
It's probably the hardest thing we've ever worked on.
And it's going to be, as a talk, a little different from what I think you're probably
accustomed to in the sense that I'm not going to be able to give you an answer.
And in fact, it's not even trivial to phrase the questions, but I'm going to be trying
to phrase the questions.
There are some issues that one can define pretty clearly.
But the underlying notion of where life came from or even what life is is just an extremely
interesting question.
And I want to start with one of the meta-issues, which is particularly interesting to me as
a chemist about this.
And it has to do with the way different subjects are thought about.
So if you consider the question of science in big, unsolved questions, you can ask, where
do chemistry, physics, biology, and so on stand in the scheme of things.
And I think if you were to talk to most people about what physics does, they would have a
pretty clear answer that it's the origin of everything in dark matter and dark energy
and nuclear weapons and quantized space, time, and all the rest of it.
And don't misunderstand me.
I am absolutely for quantized space, time.
I just don't have any idea what it means.
Then you go to biology, and biology does disease and differentiation and development
and what's an animal and things of that kind, and people understand that.
And then astronomy is stars, they blow up, they make fantastic pictures.
And you go to chemistry, and it's not completely clear what the answer is.
And there's a little bit of the feeling that you get when you go to what used to be called
the UK.
I don't know what we will call it in the future.
Where if you hear an announcement on the radio, it will say the sciences and chemistry.
And that carries something with you.
So what does chemistry do?
It is true that it makes better glue.
But there are a series of problems, and this is one, where I think that the problems that
chemistry must address fall in this category of being very big ones.
And I would argue that the origin and nature of life is not a biological question.
It's really kinetics and molecules and how they come together to make something that
is completely unexpected.
It may as really an interesting subject.
Then there are others that come after that, such as sentience.
And some of the problems that come up in the origin of life come up in the origin of sentience
but it's a little bit more complicated subject.
So we're going to talk about it only very briefly, only at the end.
Now let me show you a couple of slides that I showed some of you before, but I want to
make a point about this.
If you look from left to right in these slides, you understand that this is the natural order
of things.
If you do the same thing the other way around, it's the unnatural order.
And the question is, we all say it's perfectly obvious that you don't demix milk and coffee.
But it's worth the effort stopping for a moment and asking why it's obvious that you
don't demix milk and coffee.
It is not a trivial question.
I mean, yes, it has to do with the entropy of mixing and it has to do with conversion
of potential energy into heat and things of that kind.
I do stop for just a second and ask about it because it's very intimately connected
to the subject I'm going to talk about, which is the origin of life, which has a little
bit this character.
So I showed you this before, which is we know how to make a chicken into chicken soup.
The question is, can you make chicken soup into chicken?
And that's, we don't know how to do that, but it's a little bit even worse than that
because it's really this.
Because suppose you have something of this kind, which is, I think, what many people
would argue is the plausible cradle for life.
And then you pour the chicken soup into it and out it comes something like that.
And it seems very hard to understand how that can happen.
How do you go from a system that's disordered, dilute, contains all kinds of other stuff,
mostly other stuff?
How do you go from that spontaneously, not only to a more ordered state, but also to
a state that has the characteristic that, depending upon how you want to phrase it,
it's self-evolving or self-assembling.
We know how to do that once you get to life, but we don't know how to do it at the very
beginning.
And that's the reason, at least one reason, why I find the subject so interesting.
So the basic issue, we know that molecules are not alive.
We know that the cell is molecules, chemical reactions are not alive.
Cells are assemblies of reactions, molecules, but cells are alive.
So what happens?
How does a cell, which is a collection of reacting molecules, become alive?
And there are various answers about that.
The one that I'm going to come back to is that I think that life is simply a name that
we give to a certain kind of reaction, set of reactions.
That makes life, in a sense, a question of networks, and we don't understand how that
works.
I'm going to give you a couple of questions to think about during the course of what
comes from here.
So the first question is where and when and how did biological life start?
And we have a little bit of an idea about that, but it raises an interesting question
of could there be other kinds of life other than the life we know?
And the second question is, was the start deterministic or random?
And what I mean by that is in every planet that's a water planet and that has distribution
of elements, is life inevitable?
Is it something that will always happen, or is this just a quirk that happened once per
galaxy, or once per universe, or once per all of recorded time?
And I think at the moment we don't know that.
You can make guesses about each of these, but I don't think we know the answer.
So this has to do with statistics and probabilities, and that has to do with knowing what these
reactions are.
How does dissipation allow chaos to become order?
And we know that you can go from a disordered system to a more ordered system if the free
energy of the system goes in the right direction, and this is the second law.
But having said that, understanding how you couple dissipation of free energy to the creation
of order in detail is not at all a trivial question here.
So was it chaos, or one of the questions you can ask is there something else that we're
missing in this?
Where do alive and not alive separate?
And I'll come back to this subject again at the end, but we have two words for something
which is not clearly a binary distinction.
I mean, I don't know that there's a bright line in between life and not alive, alive
and not alive.
It may be a continuum, and if it's a continuum, what are the properties in between, and what
are the properties beyond either end?
These are questions that are very, very important when one is thinking about other forms of
life.
So those are interesting, and there's a question of, which is relevant to this subject, which
is early life and current life.
Is current life a reflection of what happened at the beginning, or was it really different
at the beginning?
Was evolution sufficiently large scale that the traces of what was the first evolving
system totally different?
And I don't think at the moment we know the answer to that question.
And so this is going to prove very relevant to one of the principal topics that I want
to talk about in terms of the sociology of this field.
And then is life more than a name for just a set of molecular processes?
And there are people who feel passionately on this subject both ways.
So is life just like a flame in a sense?
And then finally, if one, like me and others, have set off to study this, how do we know
when we've been successful?
What is the measure that you've gotten over some hump, and you're beginning to see something
that says that we sort of know what's going on?
So where did life start?
And we don't actually know where, but let's assume it started on this earth.
And when?
We actually have a pretty good idea.
The formation of earth itself, the formation of the planet, was about 4.5, 4.6 billion
years ago.
And that's fairly accurately dated.
The first, this is what's called the end of the period of heavy bombardment and ocean
evaporators as represented by this.
What does that mean?
And it means that the things that were falling in this period were big enough that you asked
the question, this object comes in and falls through the atmosphere, falls into an ocean.
What happens to the ocean, and the answer is it evaporates.
So the surface of the planet is then covered with superheated steam for 100,000 years or
something like that.
And that doesn't sound like a really great place for something as fragile as a cell to
come together.
The age of the oldest fossilized bacteria, this is still a question of some debate, but
in this period, so 4.2, 4.3 to maybe 3.5 giga years ago.
And some of the oldest traces are, in fact, in Western Australia.
But there are arguments as to what's real and what's a geological thing.
This question, how did different sets of molecules and reactions unite?
And a point which is actually quite an interesting point, which is that you can argue that life
emerged alarmingly early.
That is, if this were something which was really a random event, thinking about the
difficulty of what has to have happened, it seems that it must have happened pretty
rapidly.
Now, it's true, there's a lot of ocean, and a billion years here or there is a lot.
But the fact that it happened as early as it did, I mean, the planet's surface was barely
enough to sustain things without boiling them off, you know, it has raised some people
to raise the question that maybe it came from somewhere else, so-called panspermia.
And if it did, it doesn't really change the situation because you can then ask the question
of where it started there, you just don't know the time scale.
Now in more detail, there's some things here that are plausible but a little surprising
to chemists.
First is that the planet at that point was largely a water planet.
There are people who argue about whether it was completely underwater or mostly underwater,
it was probably mostly underwater with some land above water, probably 10% of the above
water land that we now have.
The continental plates were probably informed, there's discussion, extensive volcanism because
if there were plates, it was thin relative to what we have now, lots of geothermal activity.
The sun was cool and very UV rich, so there was a lot of stuff going on in the upper atmosphere
that produced big gradients in oxidation and things of that sort.
There was continuing impaction which may have been important because when a, it's interesting
that when even a pretty small meteor runs into the atmosphere, you ask what happens to this
stuff that's in front of the meteor as the meteor comes in at faster than the speed of
sound and the answer is it just piles up.
So a meteor simply punches a hole through the atmosphere that's five kilometers across,
takes all that stuff, ionizes it into a plasma and then smashes it into whatever it happens
to run into.
And there's the potential for doing a lot of chemistry there, but we don't know a lot
about how that chemistry works.
We know something about the atmosphere, there was maybe oxygen in the very upper regions,
in fact we're fairly oxidizing, at the surface it was mostly CO2 and N2 and water and there
are arguments about how much fixed nitrogen and methane and oxygen, there were probably
a lot of methane from geothermal sources, probably not a lot of oxygen, who knows about this,
and then the oceans were acidic, probably a pH five, mildly reducing because they were
bright red, mostly iron.
And then there was a lot of what I call pond scum and pond scum means that the atmosphere
had been swept off a number of times into outer regions of the solar system and subjected
to this UV-rich sun's radiation and what you tend to get under those circumstances are
molecules like HCN which have the characteristic that they have a very strong bond in a small
number of pieces because generally thermodynamically you favor things entropically under those
conditions that have broken up the molecule into the maximum number of pieces.
So when you see people doing synthesis in this area you'll find a lot of reliance on
HCN and H2S and acetylene and things of that sort which seem a little implausible and on
earth they probably are, but in this period in the formation of the planet they were probably
okay.
So I put this picture up again to prejudice you because I think this is what we're ultimately
thinking about whether this was on land or underwater, I don't know, but the virtue of
having it on land is that it also accumulated the stuff that was falling down, it was subject
to UV radiation, it just seems like a good sort of concentrator and reactor for a lot
of things.
And we can ask a little bit now about life itself as we know it, and a good question
is one that we can answer, what is the simplest cellular form of life right now?
And this is probably it, it's an organism known as microplasmagenitalium, a lot of work
with this and you can look at the genome of this, the genome is 5.8 megabases and there
are in the order of 800 proteins expressed and of those 800 proteins we know what in
the order of somewhere between 550 and 600 of them are and you can make guesses about
some of the others, but it just gives you a sense that this is a bag of molecules that
make up this number of proteins which do whatever life does.
So that's the introduction, now we're going to go on and talk about some of these other
subjects and just to give you a little bit of orientation, one of the disagreements in
this community, there's a schism right down the center between those who believe in what's
called the RNA world which says that I don't fall in the RNA world so I'm going to put
this in a slightly prejudiced way.
The RNA world says it is so obvious that life must have come from RNA which was both
a catalyst and a memory molecule that let's just assume that there was RNA and then go
on from there and then the other part, this is me, says I can't see how to get to RNA so
I don't care whether it was a catalyst or a memory molecule, I don't see how to get
there and there's quite a difference between these two points of view.
We'll talk about this a bit, we'll talk about some of the results from our work in chemical
fossils and about dissipative networks and I'm just going to talk briefly at the end
about information in the context of this subject.
So what does this cell do for a living?
It replicates itself and it makes the pieces for doing replication and controls that.
And the replication guys are the core of the RNA world and the metabolism guys worry about
where the pieces came from.
So the basic schema is that you start with, and we all agree with this basic structure,
somewhere there are simple chemicals like H2S and CO2 and HCN and then a lot of geochemistry.
And the geochemistry is intensely interesting and not really very well understood by current
chemistry.
We don't know a lot about geochemistry but it's much more complicated than you would
think.
So simple molecules make more complex molecules and that's fine.
Somewhere there are precursors to RNA, somehow the precursors to RNA become RNA, RNA becomes
DNA and we sort of know why that happened in terms of stability.
So that you can either start intellectually by saying we know about DNA, we know a lot
about RNA, we can ask about that and let's just assume that this happens somehow because
this is also satisfying and plausible.
And the other point of view says we know about this, we know about this but we don't understand
how to connect the two.
And those are sort of the two different approaches to the problem.
Now what about the RNA world?
Why is it so satisfying?
Well RNA is a very interesting molecule.
Let's start with DNA.
RNA is of course the double helix, it's the memory molecule and we understand a lot about
DNA, it contains information in base pairs but more to the point the cell puts in a lot
of effort to make DNA out of RNA because you get long-term stability that way, long-term
chemical stability.
But RNA has the characteristic that it looks a lot like DNA in terms of a sequence of bases
which in many circumstances will base pair and also RNA is a catalyst.
So if it's both a catalyst and in principle, both in principle a catalyst and in principle
a memory molecule, it must have been the thing that started off this particular approach.
But part of the evidence sort of favoring this is the ribosome which is of course a
key molecule in replication of proteins and it has the characteristic that you can think
of it depending upon your point of view as a matrix of proteins with RNA plastered in
between or I think more plausibly as a giant catalyst made out of RNA with proteins stabilizing
the whole business.
But it's a mixture of these two, it's about half and half.
The problem with this point of view is that RNA, we can't figure out how to get there
in my view.
Further RNA is a catalyst but it's not a very good catalyst, what it mostly does is catalyze
reactions that involve phosphates and it isn't a very good, it looks like it should be a
good memory molecule but it isn't really.
So yes, these are good steps along the way but it's not obvious that that's the final
thing.
So one of the questions that you can ask here is the plausible question of okay, so RNA
isn't the right thing as we know it now and either for catalysis or for memory but maybe
we're missing some steps, maybe there was something like RNA which would work better
but it's disappeared through evolution.
I don't think anyone has a good suggestion of what that might be but it certainly is
a possibility.
The other approach is to say metabolism and there's been some absolutely brilliant chemistry
done by Albert Escher Moser and Leslie Orgel and John Sutherland and Christian Dedeuve
and many others who've thought about the kinds of molecules that you can make in an organic
laboratory and they have done amazing stuff and particularly I would point to Escher Moser
and Sutherland, Escher Moser had a very nice synthesis of vitamin B12 that involved nothing
more than HCM.
So he made vitamin B12 which is a very complex molecule starting just from those pieces.
The trouble with that was that the synthesis which was absolutely brilliant also involved
20 years of very, very skilled synthetic technicians in Zurich in well-defined laboratory
conditions and whether that really tells you something about what could have happened
in a wildly disordered planet, I don't know, I happen to think not but I could be wrong.
So this is an issue.
You can make very important things and Sutherland has even found a way of going from simple pieces
directly to a base and as a precursor for RNA whether this applies or not is a question.
So the question to arcane conditions that is conditions in the peri-biotic world is
that there's no obvious route to RNA using this kind of thing or the proteins.
The laboratory conditions under which this all happened, smokers and volcanoes and lightnings
and toxic compounds don't bear much resemblance to what's going on up here and then there
are a series of things having to do particularly with concentration because if you're going
to have two molecules react with one another at a finite rate they have to have some proximity
to one another and if they're dilute present but dilute in an ocean what is the probability
that you will get reactions that lead to the kind of thing that you want with a cell probably
not high.
There are hints that I think are interesting and one is relevant to what I'm going to tell
you later that there might be other ways of doing it.
So for example you can make peptides, you can make proteins, little proteins without
having a ribosome and the method is probably most important now is something which is actually
pretty complicated in its own right but it involves a piece of machinery in which the
sequence of the protein is determined by the sequence of subunits, protein subunits which
instead of using RNA and activated amino acids use thioesters and this is one reason why Christian
did talk about the thioester world this particular thing makes molecules of this sort and a bunch
of other bacteria derived antibiotics that are little peptides but probably more important
exactly the same kind of chemistry makes fatty acids which are the lipids that make up the
cell membrane so it's a very successful reaction pathway.
Now just a couple of points here and this is as a reminder something you already know
when we talk about equilibrium systems in chemistry we sort of understand what we're doing
we have pretty well established rules for doing equilibrium.
We do understand the sources of free energy that could be used in
origin of life so sunlight and radioactive decay heat in the center of the earth coming out in
thermal gradients concentration gradients things of that sort it turns out that although there are
many gradients in for example temperature between a kilometer down in the earth and the surface
we don't have very good methods of harnessing that kind of of energy free energy to do chemistry with
and there is a point and this is for those of you who are students primarily to remember
when we talk about free energy we write delta g0 equals delta h0 minus t delta s0 and we
phrase this in kilocalories per mole as if it were a fundamental property
and actually it's the wrong way of writing the equation you should really write it as delta g0
over t equals delta h0 over t minus double s minus delta s0 which is a statement of
second law thermodynamics so everything is basically the second law and there's no separate
thing which is free energy is just entropy that runs everything the problem with this is that of
course this is all in equilibrium conditions and exactly how to think about something that might
be a thermodynamics for a dissipative system we do not know even though some very smart people
have thought about the problem so in a sense this issue begins to boil down to the nature of
dynamic and dissipative networks and we don't have a very good understanding of these either
theoretically or empirically and there are some important issues in auto amplification and
auto catalysis that i'll come to and there's the whole field of what we call systems chemistry
and biochemistry which is a subject of active discussion but it is not correct to say that
the field has solved its internal problems so then let me turn to some experimental results
and we've taken the following kind of approach one is that we have been interested in looking at
what i call arcane compatible chemistry that is chemistry that we have chosen in the hope
that it might actually be directly relevant to the conditions of the peribiotic earth as opposed to
the conditions of a modern synthetic laboratory it's a different kind of chemistry
and i'll give you a couple of examples just to give you a notion in ATP and the origin of the
potassium sodium gradient that characterizes all of life right now and then things like
isoprenoids and metallocofactors i'm going to sketch and only sketch the area in which we spent
the most work i've talked about this briefly here before but it's the issue of of a thioester based
network and what one can get out of that in terms of self-organizing behavior
and then finally a bit on information so molecular fossils the argument here is purely hypothetical
and it may be wrong but the argument is the following that if you're thinking about the
origin of life what you might want to do to trace back to whatever was going on then is to
look at features that are common to all life now and maybe it evolved later but if it was a good
idea at the very beginning maybe it's stuck and what are some examples well all life has the
characteristic that it has it's high on potassium on the inside and it lives in an environment in
which sodium is rich on the outside so in fact the storage of free energy in terms of the potassium
sodium ratio is one of the great commonalities across life we look at this now and we say well
that's obvious if you've got potassium and sodium you can make a storage battery by simply
concentrating the dilute thing the problem with that is that of course before there was life there
was no sentience and there was certainly no thermodynamic analysis so something else has to
have happened then polyphosphates that means ATP one can make a pretty clear case for that kind of
come from thioesters i'm going to talk about that they're common throughout life ATP and the common
cofactors are common throughout life where did these things come from and then these major
metabolic cycles like the Krebs cycle and glycolysis and the light sensitive molecules that are used
almost everywhere to harvest sunlight so porphyrins and retinal flavins and things of that kind
so let's start with ATP because that one is easy this is of course the activating chemistry the
equivalent of the chloride the carbonyl chloride in in all of synthetic chemistry that's used to
activate oxygen and all it has to do is to take phosphate in the presence of urea on a hot rock
and you heat it at 100 degrees and what you see by um capillary electrophoresis is this series of
peaks and these sort of jagged peaks there each of which is another step longer polymer of polyphosphate
so that it's not hard to take phosphate and condense it into polymers and in fact their
organisms even now that use polyphosphate as a principal energy storage source and so it's natural
to say that triphosphate attached to some recognition handle could have been the origin of ATP
that that seems okay the sodium potassium gradient this is more complicated but the
question here is is there a way in which you could plausibly have gotten to
to to media that were high in potassium and low in sodium even though the environment is very rich
in sodium and poor in potassium and to do this you go to geochemistry and without going through
the details very common rocks or basalts and fels bars and zeolites of various sorts and clays
these are all basically aluminum silicates of various kinds and if you take one of these
mixtures you know you take a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate and you
put in a solution with something that becomes well you start with a molecular sieve and a mixture of
sodium and potassium or aluminum mixture of sodium potassium allow these to convert into their stable
form the crystals that are formed here the mineral that's formed here is a hundred percent potassium
essentially and with aluminum it's a hundred percent potassium so that you can find geochemical
processes which naturally crystallize things in terms of very high potassium forms so the idea
would be that you start with a sodium potassium mixture of some kind you do a crystallization
on the surface of a volcano and then you wash away the sodium that's left and what you're left with
is a potassium rich brine and that would be the place where in this argument you would have started
something and then although we haven't done isopronoids I think you can make a good story there and
the story suggests this idea of missing things the way isopronoids are made in current isopronoids
for those of you who are not organic comets are things that are derived from isoprene formally
which is this C5 molecule and the way it's made now is a pretty complicated process by which you
start with acetyl CoA which is a thioester you make this rather complicated molecule by some
processes that we understand and end up with this and it's all under tight control but it turns out
that the most stable and most abundant olefin in C4 that you can make is isobutylene very
stable molecule and formaldehyde very plausibly could have been formed by reaction of methane
produced geochemically with oxygen produced by photolysis of water in the upper atmosphere
so there was almost certainly formaldehyde there and a touch of acid makes this or precursors of
this and then we know that acid from that begins to form the bonds that form this so here I think
what happened was a natural process that went this way that's evolved over time into this
and that touches on the RNA issue and saying that there's no life that does this now it's been lost
but the products have been preserved and it seems plausible that one could have started with RNA
precursors something else that then evolved into RNA in the same general way
so one can work through a number of the the important catalysts that are present in
everywhere urease is the enzyme that hydrolyzes urea carbonic anhydrase is a key enzyme that
catalyzes the equilibration of carbon dioxide and CO2 carbon dioxide and carbonate the ferrodoxins
are really important in various ways in redox chemistry nitrogenase whatever these all have
active sites that look just like minerals so the idea that they may have formed by just taking
colloids in smokers and wrapping stabilizing proteins or something around them makes pretty
good sense so I think one can find plausible ways of making a very large number of cofactors
cofactor containing enzymes from pieces that are either naturally occurring colloidal minerals
or simple molecules that could have been formed by the kind of processes that we're familiar with
now can you put all this together and here I'm giving you a kind of community view
that probably the most plausible environment to think of for these earliest life forms
was this or maybe it was a deep smoker or maybe it was a dying sea these have the characteristic
that they concentrate because you have dilute solutions of things coming in they evaporate water
in the heat and so you get concentration you get uv irradiation you get colloidal catalytic
minerals being produced you can imagine ways in which you get a high potassium brine there are a
lot of pieces that come together into a story that is not a convincing story for anything but it's
a start there is however a little glitch or at least in my view there's a glitch and you see it in
for example metabolic processes that are common to all life basically such as the Krebs cycle
the Krebs cycle if you look at it it has a couple of thioesters that's good we were comfortable
with thioesters although we don't know exactly how to make them there are things that are iron
sulfur clusters those are colloids from hot springs they're these sulfur compounds were
certainly not acetyl-CoA but they can have come from hot springs this can have come from evaporation
there are other steps here's another colloid you know the pieces all look or together okay
but the problem is this one that each one you can make an explanation for where it kind of come
from but we don't have any idea of how it was all integrated into a piece high potassium brine
isobutylene plus acid um deep smoker a deep smoker probably hydrocarbon junk and deep smokers
how does this all get together no idea i'm not a clue right now
so we're moving having not declared success in point a moving on to the problem that i think
is really the problem this is the were the era of the modern of the RNA world the field of the RNA
world we're interested in this problem which is networks and are there alternatives to RNA
in terms of memory i mean can you have a memory in a cell that isn't based on RNA or DNA and
we've taken an approach to this which is we'll see it's to say that the cell is a dissipative system
it takes fuel which is glucose and other nutrients and oxygen and it burns them in a reactor it makes
co2 and other forms of waste and what it does with that is to generate the components that make the
cell and we're going to model that in terms of something which seems ridiculously far away
which is a flame and a flame takes a reactant which is a methane rather than glucose and it
takes oxygen and it burns them and it makes heat and light and co2 and water so how do you put all
that together how do how do we learn something from this that is in any sense relevant to this
and we're going to do it by using chemical engineering to model the cell with what those of
you who are chemical re engineers will recognize as a continuous stirred tank reactor except
that a cell doesn't require stirring because it's so small that diffusive mixing is as fast as you
need it to be now we're going to do one other thing here which is to try to deal with the problem
of complex behavior and if you remember a cell has the characteristic that it grows and then it
replicates and it grows and it replicates so there's a periodic behavior to it where else do you see
periodic behavior of that sort and one of the places that i've always been curious about
is that those of you who have seen and even worked with gas stoves that have these ring burners
will notice that when you turn down the flame as the flame goes down you'll often get a rotating
circular behavior i mean very interesting where does that come from and what's happening there is
that as the flame goes down locally it will use up all the methane and but it will illuminate the
flame next to it and it goes around in a circle and by the time flame comes back to here this
will have gotten enough methane in it that it can go off again that's the sort of general process
you're working just on the edge of instability so what we're going to do is to work with a flame
in which in essence a flame in which we have a chemical reaction not a methane reaction
but it's one in which we are going to try to get this kind of cyclic behavior
and the system that we're going to work with is styloesters and i'm going to tell you the
result for those of you who are organic chemists that are interesting and important the reason for
working with this system is that thioesters have a remarkable characteristic which is this
carbon sulfur bond can exchange with other carbon sulfur bonds essentially quantitatively
rather than hydrolyzing which makes it an ideal system for working with an ideal
reactant for working with system so this is another argument for the thioester kind of world
and ignoring the details the relative rates of hydrolysis of the system we studied in detail
the relative rates of exchange reactions one file for another versus hydrolysis is in the
order of 100,000 to one which is enough to do anything we need to do so it's a very very good
reaction and i think a number of us have the intuition that the only reactions that have the
robustness to contribute to the development of complexity are reactions that go in essentially
quantitative yield so here's the reaction don't bother to look at it because it's
too complicated to understand i just want to put it up there to make the case the following case that
if i look at this as a long-term organic chemist i can't make any sense out of it it's too many
things going on and i can write the differential equations and in fact solve them but or simulate
them but that doesn't help me very much either so it's a problem that comes up fairly often in
the chemistry of complex systems that you can get things to work empirically but by doing so you
don't necessarily learn everything you all learn so understanding and doing are not the same thing
and what we've begun to appreciate is that there are other languages
for thinking about these kinds of complex systems that make them much easier to work with
and the one that we're pursuing at this point is control theory which is a language and approach
to the simulation and control of complex systems such as for example a petroleum refinery
and we've broken this problem up into pieces that actually can be
understood and the entire system i'm going to show you all of this stuff consists of three steps
there's a step that's an auto amplifying step in which once a set of reactions reaches a certain
critical value a reaction goes off exponentially and for many complex behaviors you need auto
amplification to set this off we need a trigger and the trigger is going to be composed of a
process that makes the triggering molecule competing with another process that destroys the
triggering molecule and there's a third step which is washing out of the reactor which enables
you to control the concentrations of many of the pieces all at the same time those are the components
and when you embody this in an actual device it's pretty straightforward a little complicated to do
but syringes that feed the reactants into a mixer the mixer goes into a stir you measure products
that come out and there's a lot of technical detail in this but the basic structure is very easy to
understand and when you do that this is the behavior you see that is if you look for example at the
products you will see as you increase the rate at which you feed the reactants into the reactor
a steady state you change that rate you get to another steady state you change that you get to
another steady state you change you get to another one goes down and then you reverse that process
here to here to here and you don't go back this way you go a different way so the system shows
what's called bistability that is proceeding in one direction you get this series of behaviors
and proceeding in the reverse of this behavior you get a totally different set of
procedures of reactions reactions so by stability you see oscillations so the reactions show
spontaneous oscillations like the division of cells and it may be completely unrelated but
it's that kind of stability and you see something that I'll come back to which is that as you change
the control parameter here which is the space velocity which is basically the rate at which
basically the rate at which you feed reactants into the reactor you see this complex behavior
over a range but when you make it faster or slower that behavior disappears so it's a behavior that's
defined over a limited set of circumstances and as many processes with life if you freeze me solid
I don't work if you heat me to 100 degrees I don't work so I don't think it's worth the effort
here to go through the details other than just to show a couple of essential features in the
auto amplification reaction what one does is to start with a reaction that has a thiol group
you do chemistry which was designed and at the end of a single cycle of reaction you get two
thiols it is amazingly difficult in chemistry to design such processes there are very few of them
explosion is one crystallization arguably is one maybe electoralist deposition but
for reasons that I don't understand you just don't see very many auto amplifying or autocatalytic
reactions and I think it's probably an area where there's great room for discovery the trigger is
simply to take one of these things and to hydrolyze it it's the thiol that starts the reaction and we
can control how much of that's here by having a reaction that destroys that and you can see
this is in red the concentration of this inhibitor as it's consumed the auto amplifying reaction
does nothing so long as it's there as soon as it goes away the reaction goes off autocatalytically
so that's the triggering process and then inhibition is a related kind of thing it's even
more complicated to understand but this behavior here this is the first time that anyone has taken
a system which is biologically relevant in the sense of containing kinds of chemistry that could
have occurred and demonstrated a complex bistable oscillating behavior of the sort that you see here
and it's quite interesting and their business got a number of people very excited
now one thing that fits into this that is a you know a broadly interesting subject to me
is the issue of robustness what you find in these systems is that they do this
oscillation but they do it only a very narrow range interestingly though you take related
molecules which do not oscillate you put them in and they're entrained by the oscillating
reaction so the whole system oscillates and so what you can do is to make a system that oscillates
but over a much broader range of conditions by including a mixture of things which do what
they do it raises a question which has to do with Darwin and we have a picture of Darwinian
evolution which says that what life does is to optimize its behavior to make the fastest cheetah
or the best beak for a goldfincher or whatever it might be an alternative view is to say that all
of that is a view of life which is life as it is now in a highly optimized form and at the beginning
what in fact we may have needed was the most robust reaction as possible which is actually a
quite different set of processing and so these these kinds of things provide a very good way
of studying that kind of thing now let me finish by just talking briefly about this question of
memory because one of the characteristics of life is that it has a memory that's DNA
and the characteristic of DNA is it's carefully tuned so that in each cycle of replication
there's a certain amount of error those errors generate the mutations which allow the system
to evolve so mutations and error big deal so when we think about memory and you know think
about evolution we have to think about these kinds of questions and I raise these for you to
consider as we go on here how do we know whether something is alive or dead I mean what's the
criterion we're going to use it's alive it can mutate and evolve if it's dead presumably it can't
but is there a distinction that we can make between live and dead or not alive
and we're talking about something of this sort well I'll come back to this in just a moment
but is a frozen embryo alive it does no chemistry it doesn't evolve it doesn't do anything
but you warm it up and it becomes palpably alive is there a point sharp point where something
happens what about a virus or what about a city is the city alive it certainly can evolve it has
a memory it can divide it can do all the other things that in principle a cell can do but it's
certainly not a cell and then an interesting question that we're beginning to think about is
if we have a hard time understanding how something becomes alive can we understand
how things die and that's not so easy either because there's we think of death in a pretty
straightforward way as the brain stops working but that doesn't have all that much to do arguably
with whether something an organism is alive or dead because many organisms don't have
live brains anyway living or dead so I want to show you just a couple of plots along this
axis I'm going to have a liveness and I don't know what that is and along this axis I'm going to
have complicatedness or complexity which are somewhat different and I don't know exactly what
that is either but pictures of this would be in one sense a binary that is something is dead
up to a certain point or it's not alive where a flip a switch flips and it becomes alive that's
binary okay another would be something of this sort it would be sort of exponential or maybe
it'd be sigmoidal if it's exponential it becomes more complicated it becomes more alive
and you could then ask where we are in this or you could say and I think this is the kind of
in the back of the mind interpretation that we tend to have which is that life started
with nothing it got more and more complicated until it reached the ultimate crown of creation
which is us and maybe that's right or maybe it's not right but then there are other things
of this sort and the one that I think keeps cropping up is folded bifurcations and an
bolded bifurcation that governing equation that would be an exponential here actually looks like
this and it has the characteristic that things are going along and going along and they're
getting more complicated and that at a certain point something happens and it doesn't continue
up in that direction it undergoes a transition it hops but then when you turn down the complexity
it comes down here it doesn't reverse the path it does this it's by stable in that sense and I
showed you an example of that with the thiol chemistry but it could this be what we should be
imagining or should we be imagining this or we should we be imagining this I mean what what is
the proper description of how something goes from not alive to alive and I don't think we have this
is not a question of origin of life it's a broader question I don't think we have a good answer to
that so when you're thinking about that I think most people who are scientists are now sufficiently
marinated in the world of binary arithmetic that we tend to have a binary prejudice
and I want to just do a quick comparison of binary as in integrated circuits with
whatever it is that goes on with enzymes so when one thinks about an integrated circuit you're
thinking about a collection of switches that are mostly on or off there's a common working fluid
which is electrons everything works with electrons and everything works at a common voltage between
the rail and ground the function of this system is defined by the fixed topography of the system
that is what's connected to what the switches are binary and they're really fast memory is
capacitors are magnetic domains that are switched on or off that's a a the system is in a sense
non-bolts one that is the on and off are equally energetic that's not quite true but we don't need
to worry about it but the whole system is organized by a common clock though all the things go through
steps in synchrony and that's a way of thinking about it biochemistry is fundamentally different
it's not this it's this everything is sigmoidal the cell is a sac so the dimensions are set by
diffusion there's no topographical organization there are multiple working fluids every compound
in principle can influence every one of the other switches it doesn't slightly synchronized maybe
you get sigmoidal responses it's very slow and it has memory embedded in dna or rna or maybe in
networks so they're fundamentally different systems and should we think about them the same way
how do we think about control and i don't want to go through any of this other than to point out
that in biology you use control strategies that look like this for example for high amplification
molecule a will go to b and b will be converted back to a but b will a catalyst for c goes to d
and d will it be a catalyst for e goes to f and if you look at an important reaction like forming
a blood clot it looks like that why does it have that structure and i don't think we have any idea
why it has that structure but it's a very interesting problem so i've raised with you a number of
questions and i don't think that i can answer really any of them which is why it's such an
interesting area but i think this final slide is one that's good to leave the subject with
you can ask the question what is life and perhaps as with an electron and i mentioned this in the
previous slide when i talked to my friends who are physicists and say what is an electron
what they say is you can't ask that question you can't ask the question of what an electron is
you can only ask the question of what it does and so it may be that we have a slightly confused
impression with this subject of asking what it is as opposed to asking what it does
and you come out with quite different answers when you think about two different things that way
so it is a wonderful subject to think about it actually is one of the big problems in science
it is something which i think only chemistry can do or chemistry chemistry and chemical
engineering and it's something for us to have a good deal of fun working with i can't at the moment
think of a single application of this but that's okay thank you very much for the invitation
thank you george there was a question
so when for example people at nasa when they're looking for another life form outside of the
uh why are they always looking for water is water really necessary for another life form
there'd be another life form that can use something else after the
the answer to that is we don't know and if you ask what could another solvent be
you can think of other solvents well let's say one of the characteristics of water
is that you can put a hydrocarbon shell around water in terms of the lipid
and make a compartment and that's probably necessary for life as it develops there are
other solvents in which you could do that for example hcn the problem is that it's not so easy
to make oceans of hcn and pure hcn has the characteristic that it's a neat liquid but it
blows up so hcn i think would have a tendency to go wrong my colleague frank westheimer
ex-colleague frank westheimer wrote a paper at one point which he called why phosphate
and he simply went through all of biochemistry as he knew it and asked if there was anything
that he could think of that could replace phosphate in water containing life and he
came up with the conclusion nothing could replace phosphate so that doesn't mean you
couldn't think of something else but it does mean it's going to be a hard thing to do
so my guess is that if you want to look for other forms other planets with life it's good to look
for water and the you know the figure which i think i've told some of you you hold your finger at
that size roughly at about an arm's length and point in any direction and you see a billion
galaxies that angle sometimes a billion galaxies and each of those galaxies is 10 billion stars
and most of those stars well many of those stars will have planets and at least some of those
planets are bound to be water so i think there's effectively an infinite number of
water planets around there how long life lasts is a different question it may be that we're a
you know a billion-year phenomenon but you don't know that's the question i think
yeah
yeah the answer that's again a it's a neat question we don't know very many alkaline
vents there are a lot more acidic vents that doesn't mean that a slightly idiosyncratic reaction
couldn't have happened in alkaline winds and i agree that there's a lot of good chemistry that you
can do in alkaline systems that you can't do in acidic systems on the other hand the whole ocean
was acidic so that if you're doing something in a vent and it's then spewing out into the environment
you'd have to do it in alkaline conditions and have it stable under acidic conditions
yeah
yep i i i agree i think they're very interesting and for those of you who don't follow this subject
there is an argument that the initial life if you want to put it that way the initial cell
was not a lipid container but it was a crack in the rock and the crack was lined with catalytically
active minerals and it had stuff flowing by it and may have had a plug of hydrocarbon junk at the end
but it didn't look at all like a cell as we now know it it looked like a geological feature
and it developed later on and it could have certainly developed in an alkaline environment
so um that was really nice uh my question is about the RNA sort of going um and you
seemed to indicate that there were two ways of thinking about things but potentially they could
be joined and i was wondering if you thought that some of the work you showed here today
could still lead to the the development of RNA in species and then from there we can see where
we're going to DNA from yep absolutely yes the question is is there reaction chemistry that
goes from the simple pieces that we can imagine to RNA or just did RNA come by through something
looked like RNA but was simpler and easier to come by or did it just happen that you know some
alkaline environment whatever coughed up RNA i don't see how you cough up RNA but John Sutherland
thinks that it's possible and in specially controlled conditions he has made one base
uh you've raised the difficulties with answering the what is life question by focusing on things
entities and saying is this alive is that alive maybe we can overcome part of the difficulty
by thinking of life and obviously a series of entities but it's a process that process
converted a simple cell let's say simple life into complex life giraffes etc and maybe that same
process exactly that same process formulated in chemical terms converted
inanimate matter let's say dead matter into simplest life and therefore by thinking about life
as a process and focusing less on specific chemicals or materials one can get a better
understanding of what life is i think that's exactly right in fact and as i said to me life
is like a flame that is it is a collection of reactions which has a certain set of properties
and so reason we focus on reactions and entities is to in a sense provide a plausibility to things
how could you have gotten complexity but a flame even a methane oxygen flame is probably 10 000
reactions and we're very happy with a flame without ever knowing how a flame actually operates
and my guess my if i had to guess i would say life is going to be like that so it is a series
of processes and networks which have a property in their aggregate but maybe have different forms
in between what's so interesting about life is a process you take methane oxygen you heat it
and all of the free energy potential free energy there is dumped as heat what happens in life
is it is exquisitely good at taking that overall free energy gap and pulling off little pieces of
it and using each little piece in a different way and the question is really how would you go from
something that's a big gradient undifferentiated in it's into a series of little ones that build
constructively to something that becomes more complicated and i i don't understand how to do
that right now hi george i'm a archaeologist come to dinner with you and i'm interested to talk a
bit more and so excuse this question but about three slides before the end you showed a series
of reactions that sort of stepped one to the other and like as intuitively that looks like a very
nice approach in private that you talked about the difficulty of some chemical reactions going
into binary and duplicating themselves but that's stepwise reaction about developing complexity
in a piecemeal way where each reaction is not at all dependent on what falls on but it comes to a
certain stage and then it gets added on like complexity that that intuitively looks very
exciting to me is that a common way that chemistry works it's a common way that chemistry works i
mean if you think about complex synthesis you do reactions and reactions and reactions and each one
makes a more complicated piece and at the end you have a very complicated structure however each is
separate it's run in isolation and the conditions are typically incompatible from one to another
and so what seems to happen here maybe this also occurred in a series of different thermal
ponds or something of that kind it's just that we don't know so the question of how you break
up something into these pieces that make stuff that fits together into a network that shows
complex behavior is an interesting question and that system that i showed you with the network
is probably not directly relevant to anything involving life except that the chemistry is the
kind of chemistry that you could easily occur imagine occurring in an alkaline vent or even in
an acidic vent so it is not wildly out of out of whack with what might have happened so it's a small
step if i if i can just follow up with a short teaser i think it's very interesting this question
about alkalinity versus acidity one of the things i think that's underappreciated about hot spring
fields is that within a single field which may have tens to hundreds of pools you get the entire range
from acid to alkaline and they can exchange information he talked before about the oceans
problematic
one of the things which i've come to appreciate in this is that if somebody's been studying
chemistry for a long while there's an entire universe of stuff having to do with geochemistry
that is critically involved in this story since this is undoubtedly where
much of the free energy came from and the catalyst and the reactants and all the rest of that
i don't know anything about it at all nothing and it's a it's a it's a glaring hole in this
this subject right now we just don't know the chemistry so you and i are going to have a nice
dinner together let's thank you very much
