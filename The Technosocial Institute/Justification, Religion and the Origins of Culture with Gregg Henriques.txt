Completely而非.
What should we do with that room?
All right, I've hit record, so let's go and see where we work up.
We already jumped the gun slightly, but let's rain it back in and see where we go.
So we're going to think about building religion, building reality tunnels, and I think we're
going to start with a little thinking around your work on the justification systems theory
as a framework to begin doing this.
So Greg, the justification systems theory, take it away.
Great, man.
Thank you.
And I look forward to connecting this to Daniel's work and our thinking about sort of where
we are in the 21st century.
So just what I'll refer to as just, which is justification systems theory, I built this
framework called the Tree of Knowledge, and what it does is it divides reality into four
different planes of existence, labeled matter, which is the material world, and then life,
which emerges out of that as a function of genes and cells and their communication and
information processing, and then mind, which corresponds to animals and neuro information
processing, and then ultimately humans, culture, and the culture person plane of existence.
And if you're familiar with the Tree of Knowledge, it's four upside down cones.
And then it has joints between the dimensions, like what is it that gives rise to them?
It's a just or justification systems theory is the idea of what makes us transition from
nonverbal or preverbal primates, is hanging around on the savannah in clusters of who
knows 50, 150 or whatever individuals, and then argues over the last 200,000 years, and
in particular in an accelerating rates, the last 100,000 years, last 50,000 years, last
5,000 years, there's been a real acceleration and an evolution of capital C culture.
And capital C culture refers to the shared language based beliefs and values that people
develop and just refers to these as justification systems.
So in order to get oriented, then you sort of want to say, okay, well, what do I mean
by that?
It's like, well, we want to differentiate society, so society is all the buildings and
gets into design and all of the material cultural stuff, the technology that we develop.
And then how does it is that we actually share in a world with each other?
Okay.
How do we connect?
And language is a portal for that, and then language is organized into meaning making
systems that legitimize what is an opt, and these systems are called justification systems.
So that's basically, it's a framework for thinking about what human culture is as justification
systems.
So then the issue is, well, where the hell these things come from?
Why all of a sudden did these things take off?
And how do they connect to the human mind?
All right.
How do we understand that?
And justification systems theory is the theory about those points.
Okay.
So let's go back to the history.
And what is it about humans that are really unique?
Well, there are a number of cognitive features, mental ability features that we have that
are really unique.
One of the most obvious ones is language.
Okay.
So other animals communicate, and they actually have really sophisticated communication systems.
Bees will engage in waggle dances, and birds have remarkable calls, and chimpanzees engage
in all sorts of facial expressions and other kinds of signals.
But human language is a fundamentally unique kind of communication, okay?
And many people wonder about the why, where do human language come from?
And we can certainly get into that some.
There's a lot of mysteries about exactly what gave rise to that development.
But virtually everybody, although they ask questions about why, the argument essentially
is as well, maybe tool, use, and social behavior, and our ability to imitate, and our ability
to understand intention.
These are all good hypotheses.
Of course, we start eating meat, we use fire, our brains get a lot bigger.
But whatever the case, generally, the idea is that once language gets on the scene, okay,
then it serves this communication system, and allows us to store and share information
really cheaply, all right?
And then it allows us to engage in intergenerational learning.
So we accumulate knowledge over the generations, and that's what gives rise to culture.
And all of that is 100% right, as far as I'm concerned.
But it's not the whole picture, okay?
Let's just add some really key pieces to the picture to help us understand both the structure
of culture, meaning the structure of these belief value systems.
It helps us understand philosophy, and it helps us understand human psychology.
Let's see how.
Okay.
So, let's say, here you are, we have right before full language happens, all right?
What you have is this capacity, increased capacities for us, for social, harmonizing,
in the origin of the modern mind, Merlin-Donald calls mimetics, where we remind with each other,
we imitate each other, we understand, and we use sort of broken language, okay?
Broken language would be something like, there, antelope.
In other words, you have words that you yoke together to give some sort of meaning.
But there, antelope is not a proposition, okay?
You just go, you don't think about it at all.
What happens when you say, there are the antelope?
Now, all of a sudden, you change the game because you created a propositional meaning,
which, by the way, is the fundamental unit structure of our language systems,
is propositional meaning statements, okay?
Now, something really interesting happens when you give rise to a propositional meaning statement.
It makes a claim about a state of facts of the world or a value statement about the world, okay?
It's a claim that, the cool thing that the justification systems notes,
is the cool thing is, that claim can now be challenged, okay?
So you can say the antelope over there, now you can say, oh, no, they're not,
or prove it to me, okay?
Because now that a propositional state has made a claim about a state of affairs,
and what then gives rise to the capacity to ask questions.
So propositions set the stage then, when you have full claim statements,
now you can say, where, why, how, what, all right?
And what that means then is that proposition now has faces,
what I call the first layer, which is the problem of justification, all right?
The problem of justification is how the hell do you decide what propositions are legitimate,
about what is true and what we ought to do?
And what this says is that what happened then is a dialogical process,
meaning a discussion process.
John Verbeke is talking a lot about dialogos lately,
and he's really absolutely correct that our reasoning systems are really designed to engage,
not in some unbelievable genius sitting on a mountain somewhere,
but their conversations.
Daniel, what do you think?
Oh, and what do you think?
How do we justify our actions together, okay?
And determine what is legitimate.
And this gives rise to social pragmatic reasoning,
and there's a book on what the Ignecbo reason by Mercer and Sperber, who kind of, you know,
took some of the ideas that I had anyway, and they argued about them and advertised them,
and they showed that human reason given and reasoning processing
about justification and argumentation, okay?
So that's one layer, all right?
So now all of a sudden we have this idea, and I want to then suggest that our fundamental
units of meaning shouldn't be thought of as propositions,
but should be thought of as justifications, all right?
What that means is that this is the actual way they function in the world.
They legitimize is an ought, and then we behave, we invest,
and we influence each other based on these units, okay?
They also get networked in together to create justifications systems, all right?
Which are systems of these bricks of understanding they can put together in more of a house.
All right, so we got the problem of justification, all right?
And then the dialogue around justification,
these start to build these systems of justification.
So that's key.
That's an advance on our understanding of language,
but that's not exactly where the justification doesn't end,
system series I meant there.
It orients us more directly to what's called the justification hypothesis,
which is a subset of an idea under these justification systems there.
Here's the way it works, okay?
So now we have these propositions in this ability to ask questions.
The other thing that language does that other people haven't picked up on is it's a window.
It's great for sharing information, but it's also a window in thoughts
in a way that fundamentally no other animal has to deal with.
So I say to you, hey Owen, why do you feel the way you do, okay?
Now imagine the classic example I use is,
let's say I'm parabonded with somebody and I go off hunting, all right?
And then you come in and you're interested in my mate, okay?
And I come back and I notice you're hanging around and say,
hey Owen, why spend so much time with her, okay?
And let's say you've asked her to plant some seeds earlier in the day,
what's the first thing that you say?
You don't say, hey Greg, I'm thinking about separating the two of you
and taking her as my mate, even though that's what you're thinking, okay?
Instead what you say is, hey, I'm just hanging around,
she's planting me to show me how to plant seeds.
In other words, you adopt the narrative,
the socially acceptable narrative that takes into consideration
the social influence and impact of you sharing your thoughts on the social world.
You don't share the most self-centered thoughts that you have, okay?
You share the most socially acceptable thoughts
so you can navigate the social influence dynamics, all right?
So the problem of social justice, the problem by which we have access,
we ask questions about what your private thoughts are
and then the question is how do you create a narrative,
the socially acceptable social justification narrative
of your thoughts and actions, okay?
So now what we have is the social justification problem.
The solution would be then an internal narrator
that interprets the underlying biological, psychological, phenomenological state
and does so and legitimizes it in a way that takes the social acceptable context
into consideration, all right?
Does that make sense?
Yeah, I'm not just going to say to you, I want to fuck your chick.
That's right.
That's right.
You're not.
You're going to put it in the context.
Now, if you had power, if the influence matrix were different,
dynamics were different, you might say that,
but everything's going to depend on your place influence matrix.
So you're going to calibrate and I just say, you know,
hey, if you have a boss that you don't like that much,
notice how much you talk about your boss when you're alone with your wife
or with your friends who are totally on your side
and then you go tell your boss what you really think, right?
You tell you in the narrative, it's very different
when you're in front of the boss if you care about your job, all right?
So everything changes depending and then just pay attention
at how people explain what they know relative to the social context
and what their influence interests are.
Everything changes and we're unbelievably sensitive to it.
I don't know.
So one example I gave when I was, when it was dawn on me,
I was running late to my wife.
I'd been late before, so she was going to be primed to be a little annoyed
and I was already 20 minutes late and then I hit some traffic
for five minutes, made me five minutes more late.
She comes in, where you been?
Traffic was horrible.
You know, I didn't say, hey, I really want to do what I was doing
and for 20 minutes I was going to be late anyway.
I had another excuse that was outside my responsibility
and I was, and that just came naturally
and I argue as a clinician, you just see this everywhere.
People are instantaneously.
And in fact, we now know the left hemisphere,
if you know neuropsychological research,
left hemisphere really is designed as an interpreter.
It interprets even when it doesn't have nothing,
split the left hemisphere off, okay?
So what does this all mean?
The justification of this offers a really new way
to understand the evolution of forces
that give rise to fundamental insight.
I'll say that again.
It's the evolutionary analysis
that give rise to Freud's fundamental insight.
What was Freud's fundamental insight?
We have a biopsychological system
that has selfish drives or at least primitive drives, okay?
We have a social scenario that says, hey,
this is what's legitimate and this is what's not.
And we have a rationalizing or I would say justifying ego
that must navigate the reality of the drives that you have
and the social environment that dictates what's legitimate.
Okay, so this is a big, so now what we have
is we have a way of understanding Freud's insight
with an evolutionary social-psychological understanding.
So that's what the justification hypothesis says.
And what that gives rise to then
is an updated model of Freud's tripartite
where you have an experiential animalistic system,
a private narrator and a public self, okay?
And then you filter between those domains.
So there's a filter between the experiential into the private,
we call that the Freudian filter.
And then when there's a public into the private into the public.
In fact, I can pull up a diagram if you want,
but anyway, I've shown that around, all right?
And that's the, so that's the three domains
only reframed in a much more modern understanding, okay?
So now we have justification hypothesis.
This orients us to kind of understanding the evolution
of the feature of language gives rise to a problem of justification,
the problem of social justification,
and that shapes our interpretive narrator.
If you want to understand human nature, okay?
You want to understand the nature of being human,
you understand that we are primates that became persons, all right?
And the nature of becoming a person
is that we are social justifiers, all right?
That I have a self-awareness
and legitimize our actions on the social stage
and take responsibility
and our other people hold us accountable.
This is culture, person, plane of existence
where you say, hey, why the hell did you do that?
You're 10 minutes away from being, right?
You got to be held accountable, and then you give accountability.
And you can look at things like how we've designed law.
The first question of law is, is the person competent
and have they been a person that socially,
we don't hold five-year-olds accountable to the law
because they're not fully functioning persons.
You go crazy and have a brain tumor.
We decide, no.
We under about your intent, you know, first-degree murder,
you thought about it.
It's in your self-awareness system.
You justify it accordingly.
Well, we're going to punish you
because that's the highest level of person, okay?
So we have a system that helps us explain human consciousness.
And then we come back to the insight before,
which basically was like, okay,
what is culture that we generate?
What evolves and what we reside in?
And then that starts where we started,
which is like, hey, it's these systems of justification, okay?
So these things now take off about 50,000 years ago
in full sustainability, all right?
And what happens if you just trail the obviousness?
So if you have the problem of justification,
you start asking questions, why, why, why?
And we see cultures will first develop animism.
So they believe the world is magical.
If you're living in the jungle,
how the hell you figure it out?
Well, there's all these gods, there's all these spirits.
Animals are doing stuff.
You're embedded in that.
And you create animistic fusion of magical systems.
I love the idea that you start with logos,
which is like solve the hunting problems during the day.
And you start to develop a mythos about,
hey, this is the story of our tribe,
the pathos, the dark energies of the sun.
Absolutely.
Let me ask you something on process to this point, right?
So you've covered a lot of terrain
and you were talking about how, as you explained this,
the emergence from matter of life, from life of mind,
all the way up to the development of language
and these justification systems.
And you've described a little bit,
like in detail how they are operationalized
with the hypothesis, justification,
the hypothesis that we create to justify behaviors, et cetera.
And there's a lot there that I want to unpack.
But now you were talking about animism and mythos
and the emergence of mythos and, you know, 50,000 years ago.
So Manuel de Landa, I don't know if you know him.
I know of him, not well.
Okay.
And so he's got this idea of the machinic phylum
and he essentially reports that kind of in the vein of the laws,
something very similar to what you're talking about,
which is that in his words and in a specific analysis,
that's technologies have lineages that they descend from each other
and that that development, just like the joint points
on that emergence theory that you have,
he calls them singularities.
These are moments where all of a sudden, you know,
all the circumstances of evolution,
of technical developments converge
and then boom, we have a new state and new,
a new sort of plane on which to talk about things.
So looking at that, and you were talking about myth
and about evolution and there might be many people listening who,
when they hear the word evolution might think that
there's a right way and a wrong way to evolve.
And especially now today, that's where we're in charge of steering ourselves,
that we look back through history and is there a right way
that this emergence happens?
Is it a one-off vertical process or how does that emergence occur
and how does it sort of converge into these nodes of these joint points that you talk about?
Yeah, all right.
So there's a fair amount there that I'll pick up on and riff off of.
So I'm, okay, let me, I'll go with the joint points really fast.
So things are evolving and emerging all the time.
Okay, and there are small emergencies.
The joint points try to capture four huge emergencies,
like these are the macro emergencies.
So the emergence of matter itself, the emergence of life,
the emergence of mind and the emergence of culture, all right?
And they're very, they're unique and interesting events
and the nature of them as such, according to the language and frame provided by the Tree of Knowledge,
what makes them unique is that they give rise to a new plane of complex adaptive behavior.
Okay, and the way they do that is because whatever complexity building feedback
happened and each one of them has its own little mystery in it.
So we don't know the answers to all this by any, let's just take life.
We don't know exactly.
We know the parts of life and we know that cells is key,
self-ysiology, the emergence of the cellular structure.
You got a membrane, you have RNA, DNA, you have organelles and proteins
and there are ideas about how all of that stuff came together
and then created natural selection, genetic information storage, epigenetic development,
and a physiology.
These are the key elements of that, okay?
But they came together to create a complexity building feedback loop, okay?
And then grew and then there was all of these different kinds of explosions and,
you know, sort of like species singularities springing off of that.
Yes.
Right?
And that the Tree of Knowledge just depicts the life landscape as the Tree of Life,
as the second dimension of complexity, as all of that emergence and splitting and recombination.
The way I think technology does operate very similarly to that.
We'll talk about what I think about technology and how I think technology is now going to merge
and fuse with culture in the 21st century in a different kind of way, right?
But so then you get the jump from life, then you get into mind.
There's a complexity building feedback loop in each case and the Tree of Knowledge then frames
each one of those, okay?
And it gives you a particular way, sort of a meta theoretical framework,
also recognizing that there's a lot of mystery.
So there's just a lot of that's unknown, all right?
But what the Tree of Knowledge says is, okay, so we have evolution,
cell theory, and genetics.
We don't even have a good idea that there's a joint point around mind,
i.e. how to get to animal, and that there's a joint point around culture.
In fact, that's my whole theoretical analysis, is that we should be thinking about joint points
from life to mind and mind to culture, not identify explicitly what they are.
Then I propose behavioral investment theories you don't want to get into.
That's the life to mind.
And that provides, like with the Cambrian explosion, about, say, 500 million,
550 million years ago, you get the animal landscape.
And that's what I mean by mind.
And then, you know, as we've talked about over the last 200,000 years,
justification says, here's the complexity building feedback
to go from primates to persons, okay?
And then there's all these different beliefs and ideologies that are happening,
and that's what the cultural dimension.
But what humans are doing, of course, is the Tree of Knowledge just is a
representation of reality.
It's not reality.
Reality is, is that humans are also building all of these material cultural elements, okay?
In other words, they're constructing both for tools and then increasingly for sacred symbols,
okay?
They're building these systems of understanding,
like you see in the cave paintings.
So you see, we see these dramatic cave paintings 40,000 years ago, 30,000 years ago,
of these animistic depictions of half-man, half-animal, mystical traditions, okay?
And so what I think is starting to happen in the evolution of justification and of technology
is people are seeking meaning-making systems because of the problem of justification
and gives rise to the problem of why.
Why do you are you doing what you're doing, okay?
And I love, there's a great book called God, a Human History by Aslan, okay?
And this is very relevant for the idea of the 21st century, as far as I'm concerned,
and why I love Alexander Bard's Synthesism, by the way, okay?
And here's the God's, the story by Aslan is he asked the question,
why did we transition technologically into agriculture?
Like why did we go from nomadic, you know, hunter-gatherer kinds of tribes into horticulture,
which was made sense because horticulture allowed you to combine the best of both worlds for many.
And so horticultural lifestyles are pretty good.
What you notice from early agricultural lifestyles, technologically wise,
if you study the bones of people who lived in that area, they're malnourished, beaten,
and injured, less healthy than a nomadic or horticultural tribe.
So why the hell would people even evolve into doing that?
Okay, that's one of the great questions.
Well, the answer is actually ontological design types of things.
And at least according to this, what he says is that what started to happen is more and more
technologically elaborate temples and activities were being engaged in.
Humans were then building bigger and bigger things.
And there's a temple at Gobekid Tempe, which is in Sturkey.
All right, it's 10,000 years old, 12,000 years old,
right at the cusp of what we understand when agriculture started to shift.
And it's a giant temple they discovered a couple of years ago.
It's longer than that, but they published it.
So what they show is that what Aslan argues is that to build this temple is a year-round project.
Okay, and the kinds of activities, worship activities that were taking place then
would be there for a year.
So that starts to explain now, if you're located a place that has to be,
why then do we go agriculture?
We go agriculture because we start building these types of temples.
Why are we building these temples?
Because we have to answer, we ask the question, what means anything?
Why the hell is shit happening?
What's my ultimate purpose?
Every culture asks, what's my ultimate purpose?
And every culture answers it by some form of mysticism in God.
God put us here for a purpose.
And then to justify that, we build, we engage in, to show our appreciation for the sacred,
we build things like temples.
And we get the temples got bigger and bigger.
So then you get this whole idea that the concept of God and our need to express that
is actually what drove the transition to agriculture,
which would have drove the transition into the building of civilizations.
And so now-
I've just been reading up on René Girard recently,
whose ideas around sacred and God and what it is that allows communities to found themselves.
And he thought, he had this idea, the mimetic theory,
that basically the trap that people fall into is that we see other people doing shit
and we copy each other.
So someone's got a pretty bit of stick and then I want the stick
and then someone else wants the stick.
And all of a sudden everyone wants that stick and we're at each other's throats
and then it moves to a point where we don't even really care about the stick anymore.
We just care about the fact that I'm pissed at you and you're pissed at me
and everyone's fucking pissed.
And that can lead to some real ugly shit because like you've said,
we're basically just chimpanzees that need to manage ourselves.
But here, this idea, we have to scapegoat.
If we can find one person to pin everything on and go,
right, he did it or it did it.
And so if we just get rid of that thing, then social harmony will be re-established.
And then it turns out, according to his ideas, that it actually works.
So what happens is this scapegoat figure becomes both this,
this like evil thing that needed to be cast out,
but also fascinating and divine,
precisely because the community was able to link up around it.
And so sacrifice gets an explanation.
And we can also see the genesis of what an idea of the sacred is.
It's something bizarre that everybody focuses towards
that creates a kind of unity within the community.
Yeah, I know I think that's a fascinating,
you know, I am not an expert under or I find his explanation of the scapegoat
in terms of how we need to justify what we feel inside
and how we reduce cognitive distance,
how we organize, how they can be an organized force in a community
that would go through these sort of traditional cycle ways.
Very, very, there's a lot of compelling, both anecdotes for that
and there's a lot of intuitive sense making that that makes it.
It's like a node that the culture needs to orient itself around something.
Right.
You're talking about temples, right?
And that's exactly what the temple, again, is doing something with this sacred figure.
Then we're not getting it because other than getting pissed that I just want that stick,
that's all built the temple together.
That's so cool.
So it feels like the just the process of the justification hypothesis
and people engaging within these systems and exchanging with each other
starts to converge naturally.
That's a very weird word,
but it feels like they start to converge around these memetic desires,
around these sacred scapegoats.
And it feels like that's the genesis of the sacred.
And perhaps correlating to what you were talking about
and talking about the temple in Turkey, Gubleki Tepe,
and that the Neolithic revolution as a point of the emergence of sedentarism.
And it's that moment as the moment where the current gods were born,
if you want to talk about it.
Were they born in that moment?
Were they different from the previous gods?
What differs?
Is this something that relates to our study of desire and the sacred
and maybe of designing interfaces for the sacred and for religion?
Right.
I think that's a wonderful question because to me,
what you start to get at is this tension between the local contingencies
of the gods that are then born for the particular specific purpose versus the archetypal
processes by which the human primate and its phenomenological structure.
It's an intuitive sense-making if we go to a Jungian type of a version of archetype,
right, that will carry a collective unconscious structure that then projects onto
the patterns of the world that have emerged over the evolutionary history.
So I have a thing called the influence matrix.
The influence matrix is an underlying structure of what the process dimensions
of our relationship system.
Okay.
And it's got an archetypal.
The argument is that we have an archetypal template in our minds,
our hearts for relational value and social influence.
This is when important others see us for who we are and they value us.
And we get social influence and validation for that.
We are prepared to have that as a template.
And when we get that, we come prepared to love that.
Okay.
That's nourishing.
All right.
Likewise, to be rejected, to be discounted, to be held in contempt by people you care about,
to be ostracized, all of this is terrifying.
Okay.
So these are fundamentally templates, like not unlike sweetness, saltiness,
savouriness in terms of our taste, all right.
And what it means is then we'll project patterns.
If this is an archetype, then how do you achieve that?
Well, is there an archetypal human male masculine hero figure that achieves
this kind of relational value?
Okay.
Is there an old with wise men?
Is there the trickster?
You know, there are particular kinds of ways in which nature
crushes us or elevates us.
So these will be the archetypal structures.
And then they'll interact with particular types of real contingencies
of what the particular local culture, the local history,
the local sacred shaman say to be, you know, the key features.
And then they'll, so they'll evolve in unique ways and create unique characteristics,
even though they'll have an archetypal background.
They will also evolve particular characteristics based on technologies that are available.
So I was just going to say, notice what happens when we get the temples into civilizations.
It's not accidental that all of a sudden we start going monotheistic instead of polyethistic.
I mean, you know, it's not, I don't think it's an
inevitable, obviously Hindi, you know, Hindu systems didn't do that,
but there were really good reasons to believe that organized in the way that they did.
It's not accidental that monotheistic systems emerge around civilizations.
Well, not only that, the idea comes up in Bard's writing is that once we got sedentary and we
invented the written word, that produces the idea of something eternal and unchanging,
which then feeds into the theological grammar and we get the idea of the one unchanging God,
precisely because communication has gone from being a word that I say,
and then it's gone to a word that I write down and it's there forever.
Yes. And I actually, and so I think that that's fascinating.
And I also think that the, for me, that the written word is to writing in mathematics
is the technological root and anchor point of what's going to give rise to the digital.
Okay. So if we, if we trace, when does the digital and the digital is the merger of material
culture. So we're in the tree of knowledge languages, material cultures out here when
it's just an axe and a knife, it's an extension of my culture, but it is not,
there's no informational interface with my system of justification.
There's feedback, all right, and the way in which I can extend myself and build it,
but it doesn't talk back to me like Siri talks back to you.
Okay. So when we start writing, we have external memory,
and then we have a written record of, of permanence. So yeah, that changes our relation.
Marshall McLuhan's work on the medium is really crucial here for how this completely
and changes our relationship, our psychology. But now our extended mind is different than
just the tools. It's actually the extension of our language mind into the world. Okay.
Then we build printing presses, okay, which then, and make everybody literate.
Then we start building computational machines, then we electronic
computational machines, then we network them all together in the internet.
And now we're starting to create informational interface so that, okay,
now we're going to put a little chip in my head, and that's going to allow me to control the mouse
that moves things around as I think move to the left, move to the right.
And that's why the 21st century is going to see this digital information interface,
okay, whereby technology loops back into us, fuses with us. And that's, you know,
passing your seat belt, right? Yeah. Just in the same way that the
bone excavations of the Neolithic reveal a lot of pain and war and all that,
something similar is going to happen. I have no doubt. And I was going to say something,
when you, when you mentioned technology and the emergence of writing and math,
so we invent the gods based on the technologies that we have, they come hand in hand.
So when monotheism is a special case for a reason, but whenever we became sedentary,
we needed to update the old gods, the nomadic gods, and we needed to invent new gods.
We invented the gods of the crops and the gods of the home, because there was no
earth in the home and a series of cultural values that came from there.
And the seed of the sacred, perhaps, Owen, kind of to try to steer towards what you asked in the
beginning of the podcast, I feel like the seed of the sacred in the emergence of all of this
lies not necessarily on maybe tracing the lineage, but tracing the intensity of feedback
between technology and humans. In other words, the agricultural gods emerged because we ourselves
became agriculture created cults. Obviously, the feedback loop is a very big dynamic here.
So I guess my feeling and what I'm trying to get towards is trying to figure out how
we map these intense intensities across the landscapes. And that might be a good clue to
figure out where will the sacred emerge? Because obviously, the intensities of old
justification systems produced an image, a likeness of God and human minds, which in turn
produced settlements. So maybe in a similar fashion, today we could also map those intensities.
And we map them through the feedback loops of interfacing with writing, with math, but now with
extended mind and with this weird turning inwards of things. I think those intensities lie the most
now. Okay, so for me, right, so we want to, if we use Peter Lindbergh's, those are the emergence
of, let's think about the waves of justification that we've gone through. And see where we are on
the justification landscape. So we have the pre-modern indigenous. What's pre-modern indigenous?
This is pre-civilization. This is the three of us in our 150-person tribe hanging out,
building narrative about what the hell is going on. The nomadic and we're embedded in nature,
and we have, and it's going to have lots of different themes, but every little tribe's
going to be different, okay? Because they're not necessarily going to come in contact with
their, and they start to start, and the emergence of civilization, agriculture, writing, and the
actual age, all right, requires transition into the formal systems of justification.
That's what I call sort of written formal systems of justification, all right? This is the history
of Buddhism, the history of Confucianism, Zoroastrian right before Judeo-Christian,
the Jewish tradition. These then are formal systems that are necessary to regulate large-scale
systems of civilization, okay? And writing in the priests, now you get the priests who actually
are then able to confer, hey, this is the interpretation, and then they study, and then
you have aspects of all that, all right? So then the formal systems of justification then merge
from the actual age all the way up through the modern age, all right? The modern age of the
Enlightenment, all right? And the Enlightenment happens in the combination of the industrial age
and what it does, the liberal democracies and modern science has a system of justification,
okay? And that shifts and creates all sorts of dynamics, of course, in relation, for example,
are we a one-world atheistic system where it's basically just the physical world,
or is there a two-world natural, supernatural, okay, in terms of archetypal models about whether
or not to make sense of a world and how to, okay? But it opens it up, it creates a universal right,
we see slavery, you know, and all of a sudden then everyone's got value, your potential for
universal rights, so modernism opens up, changes the equation, and then we get the idea that we're
going to move towards the end of history because the liberal democratic systems of justification
are so dominant, okay, that they start wiping out all the other systems and we're all going to converge.
But there's the postmodern twist in that, okay, so that the nature of these modern systems,
a, they create all sorts of different kinds of externalities and potential problems,
and b, we see the idea of how much sense-making do they actually allow and how much equality
and social justice do they allow, okay? Well, you know, not enough, let's put it that way,
not fucking enough, okay? So all of a sudden we're relative to the complexity of the world
and the knowledge problems that we have, that technology and empirical science with all its
silos is telling us about, and the ways in which human behavior is changing, the system's not nearly
up to the task, and in fact, the structure of it, philosophers gave up on it and said,
and scientists were like, whatever, we're going to go to study, so there's no architecture of
knowing, so what happens is we get a fragmented pluralism and empiricism at the knowledge side,
okay? And then you get a serious problem of justice issues that the, that the modernist thing is,
a white male, European heterosex, you know, kind of modernist frame that has much more
normative shit built into it than they're reflective about. It eliminates other cultural
indigenous variables, and so what do we get? The postmodern critique, right? The postmodern critique
is basically like, listen, you're way overshot what you can know, and you're way, you have to
contextualize all your systems of justification, that's my term, not theirs, but that's basically
issue, in the power and influence histories and contingencies that gave rise to it. And as such,
you can't step out of that, so you're all bunch of just, justifiers. I mean, I learned feminism
was my first intellectual awakening, it was like, holy shit, you know, you take a perspective on this,
I've been, I've been soaking in some masculine justification in the 80s that I wasn't aware of,
all right? All right, so now what happens? Once we have all of the fragmented confusion,
once we have all of this system of new technology, once we have the postmodern critique, it gives
rise to a fragmented pluralism, okay? A crazy fragmented pluralism, that is Peter Lindbergh's
culture war 2.0, right? A multi-polar war. We're not, we're no longer in broom church and, you know,
and that kind of basic structure. We now, that whole system, because the macro system of modernist
justification is fracturing, all right? What was regulating the global system is now losing its
legitimacy and authority, and we're getting all of this, yeah. And that's precisely the kind of the
trucks of the question that is cast upon us right now, as I say, the fifth-gen point of the 21st
century. Like, there's many routes that this could go. There's the route where we, you know,
triple down on humanism and somehow try to save whatever systems of justification and
institutions and technologies are in that sort of vector, but we see within this vast pluralism
the emergence of other sense-making, psychic technologies as well, especially the ones that
are enabled by new technologies. Could we be seeing the rise of weird new animisms that,
because memes are so mobile that the psychic technologies, the basic psychic technologies
will need necessarily to like stop being humanist, positivist, Russoian, Cartesian. Could be,
there's perhaps many others we see, we see in some weird characters like Dugan. They're using that as
justification for geopolitical movements as well. And I find that remarkable. Why? Because it's
precisely at this point where we're trying to figure out where to go, on which justifications
system to base our world order, our technological system, and our psyche. And that's precisely the
great question right now, right? I'd like to throw in there, relating to, I feel one of the things
about humanism is that paradoxically, it's actually pretty shitty for humans along a lot of
lines of the axis. It produces great material prosperity, but also why the fuck is everybody
so depressed? Why the fuck is everybody so addicted to shit? And my sense is that precisely because
this particular system of justification doesn't do anything for existential questions. It doesn't
really answer who are you or what is your place in the cosmos or why should you be a good person.
About the best answer it can give you to that is don't do bad shit because suffering sucks.
I think that is at the basis of a lot of trying to attempt to derive an ethics rationally. It's just
pain sucks. So don't do things that are painful because it's painful. And it's just totally
tautological. There's a step of faith that is involved in other justification systems that
precisely because they understand themselves as being based on faith, you're allowed to experience
yourself as having a place in the universe that isn't backed up by some kind of rationally derived
principle. And it feels like where we're at at the moment precisely because of the post-modern
fragmentation that you've just described Greg. Not only is there this kind of like within humanism,
this absence of that which makes the human full. There's also an increasing desperation for that.
I think that people are clinging ever more intensely to things that give them something akin
to what we would have once gotten out of religion. Which tends, it's what happens with the phenomenon
of cults which throughout the 20th century, for example, throughout the Jewish prefecture structure,
we're always kind of like increasingly the cult becomes a more attractive place to situate your
sense-making. And it's something that we're all doing kind of unconsciously. Another word for it is
reality bubble. Right, completely. Sorry Greg, just a small word to add to
go one's question. Feels like those cults are technologies to alleviate the discontents of
civilization. So maybe it's even humanist, maybe it's in the Freudian terms, civilization itself.
Absolutely. Okay, so lots here, lots here, all right. And this is where we definitely want to be
and heading towards. So a couple of things. So the modernist age, all right, the modernist,
you're absolutely right as far as I'm concerned. So the problem with the modernist, in fact,
this is both analytically true and humanistic spiritually true in the sense of the following.
The modernist age fucks up in that it doesn't understand the human mind.
Okay, it doesn't understand scientifically how to describe the human mind with an appropriate,
what I now call it, we're appropriate descriptive metaphysics. In other words,
what's your language system for actually describing what you see? So it reduces everything into
physics, which is ridiculous. Okay, in other words, there's a real problem of physical reductionism
inside what modern science cans us in terms of its language and conceptual framing.
All right. And what that basically translates into is it robs us from whatever the metaphysical
spiritual is, how to hold on to that in any way that would be coherent. And even what is,
that gives us rise to basic metaphysical understanding of things like love and accomplishment.
And then it essentially says, well, try to go for that, but it doesn't have heart in it.
And essentially that it reduces to wow, just don't have pain and do what you can and have fun while
you're here, right? It's a very, it's not an aspirational, it's not good for the aspirational
spiritual moral. Okay, it's weak, deeply weak in relationship to that. And that is one of the
discontents that give rise, what if you're disenchanted and some other system is able to
give you cognitive closure on what it is that you have purpose. And you yoke the old archetypal needs
to be part of a group and you have a belief system that you're certain of and the people around you
believe it. That's a hell of a lot better than this fucking chaos out there for a lot of people.
Hence the appeal of cults, right? It's unbelievably, you know, then also I know what it is, I have a
community. These are archetypal signals of what we're used to. If you build it properly, they will
come. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so now we're like, all right, so now the modernist systems coming down
and sort of giving rise to this chaotic postmodern fragmentation, we are now impoculated the planet
in this weird way that makes us, I mean, you know, you can read Steve Pinker's Enlightenment,
now I do, I think it's impressive in terms of what we've accomplished, but I don't think we can keep
going, we can't have just infinite growth, right, on an economic consumption way, plus it's empty
calories, look at how anxious and impressed we are. There's a fundamental shift that needs to happen
and we need to rediscover religion in essence. Okay, what do we mean by that? We need an affirmative
vision for what the good is. We need an affirmative vision. Now let's come back to all of these
different systems of justification. Okay, that are the multipolar war. The beauty of just, okay,
is that it allows you a language to see them all as systems of justification.
All right, so now I can step outside the stream of culture and basically observe it
rather than be in it. With the language, it's like mindfulness, it's like it's a meta move,
it's like, oh, I can now sit down and just see all these individuals in their stream of justification
trying to find the justification system that's right for you. Okay, and they're attached to their
influence and their interests and the people around them and they're building their narrative
about why they're good. Look at Peter Lindbergh's narrative, it's like, hey, here's the core,
this is what they're defied against, this is what their core issue is, these are the who the leaders
are that represent it. Okay, so you get this multipolar landscape of justification. Now the
question is, well, wait a minute, if I step outside it, then the question is, is there any
meta principles of justification? Okay, the meta principles of justification, like things that
actually transcend the local cultural narratives and give rise to a sense of what is transcendent
beyond culture. And my answer is absolutely yes. All the wisdom traditions converge on certain
kinds of concepts that overlap enormously. And when you look at the way in which wisdom
traditions overlap, it gives rise to what I used to call an integrated pluralism of morality.
It's a universal relational view of the good that overlaps a lot. Now some some emphasize
like agape and love. I emphasize things like dignity, well-being, and integrity. Those are
my big three meta values that transcend local human relations and they transcend local justifications
of particular cultural systems. They're universal across the meta justification. I can go into each
one of those big three and how they complement each other. But the point of it is that any other
macro level value system or wisdom tradition will have core values that actually overlap a lot with
this so that you can see a center of meta justification from a number of different perspectives and
emphases and that's what gives you this integrated pluralism of it. I think that's kind of a point
where I want to not fully, let's not agree, but I want to add another twist to the question which is
I think it might be also an interface and a technological problem. In other words, it might
not be enough to say that all the wisdom traditions converge on a certain point that therefore let us
all move towards that point because we have no tech to get there. We haven't got the right tools
or interface to get there in very much the same way as you said the modernists did not have the
tools to understand the human mind and therefore reduced it to physics. In the beginning you
talked about language as a technology, as these justifications, but rather I'm going to sort of
twist it and talk about it as a technology. I feel like technology, words are not sufficiently
adapted technology to address this question, the question of the meta values towards which we
could, should, or might move towards. In other words, it's one thing to say that that's a place
where we all would like to go. Another thing is to actually go and I feel like that might be an
interface, a ritual, a technological problem. And obviously that's where ontological design might
come in, but the question that ontological design is just the interface and that's again where the
question of the pathos versus the mythos and the logos comes in. Right, what matters is that pathos
is intransmissible, esoteric, and to build something that sees down from that as a proper mythology is
the work that the old traditions took thousands of years to be able to achieve and that we might not
be wise enough to be able to build it today. Hey man, do that. We have to be, well certainly, I mean
that's, so to me, this is where these, I've always, so that when I found Bard's synthiasm, which happens
to be right here, it'll synthiasm, okay, I went apeshit about it because it fused exactly the same
thing I was seeing from across the pond 20 years ago when I built the Tree of Knowledge and basically
it comes about exactly the point that you just raised, Daniel, and here's how. Okay, so it's called
the Tree of Knowledge for obvious reasons, I hope, in relation to reference to the Tree of Knowledge
in the Bible, okay, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, all right, and ultimately I emerged
into a garden and so that's the Tree Theory of Knowledge behind me, the first branch of which
is the Tree of Knowledge system, all right, and these are all mythos references, so it's in the
tree in a garden, okay, it's got eight branches on it, which are like the eight wheel, you know,
the eight fold path, they're all these different nested mythos relations as it tries to delineate
a psychic logos, articulation of pure and practical reasons for being, yeah, that's the system, all
right, so when I built the Tree of Knowledge back in, you know, late 1990s and I saw these stacked,
okay, cones of dimensions, planes of existence, okay, and each one's an emergent dimension as
this information process to communication system, all right, and I also see, so you get to culture
and this idea of an aspirational metaculture that transcends culture has exactly with it this idea
of God and the ultimate concern, the thing that would be above the tree, some metacultural image,
that's one aspect that offers, this is this wisdom idea of our ultimate concern and could we build
an ultimate system of justification, okay, and the other thing it points to is the emergence of an,
at just a, at a concrete level, it points to the emergence of the digital landscape,
all right, because there's a novel information processing system, okay, so sitting where as I
sat on the Tree of Knowledge and looked up, it was, I was looking at both God and the emergence of
the digital age, whether I was in the technological sort of grounding fact world, that's the digital,
and whether I'm looking in the aspirational world of moral, and the idea then is, is that what it
basically locates you is sit on an understanding of science in the 21st century and orient yourself
toward the moral and the digital, ground yourself and then figure out how to build a bridge, ultimately
that's the compass, and yet potentially what Scytheism is about, I mean creating God in the
internet age, right, and transcending atheism, atheism and atheism into believing in the concept
of God, that also is the internet is the digital is the machine, right, so anyway that Bard and I
or whatever many other individuals are able to or whatever construct, it's like that close
encounters are the third time, you know, everybody's seeing the mountain, I don't know if you know that
movie, but it's like people start having the image of the mountain, you know, and it is to me so that
then, and now nobody knows what, nobody knows what technology is coming, but that at least it
gives us your guardrails to frame pathway through the fifth joint point and to build bridges between
wisdom traditions and technological emergence and frame of ontological design.
