These organizations are telling you that they're building something that could kill
you and something that could remove all our freedom and liberty. And they're
saying it's a good thing you should back them because it's cool. They don't care
about the revenue. If they have the political power people are scared of
them. Power should not be invested in any one individual. If I can accelerate this
over the next period I don't have to make an impact. I should not have any power
whereas again you see everyone else trying to get more and more power. The
only way that you can beat it to create the standard that represents humanity is
decentralized intelligence. It's collective intelligence. The data sets and
norms from that will be ones that help children, that help people suffering, that
reflect our moral upstanding and the best of us and gathers the best of us to do
it. A week ago, Emaid Mistak was on my stage at Abundance 360 talking about the
future of open source AI, democratized decentralized AI. The day after A360 he
stepped down as CEO of Stability. Now five days later I've sat down with Emaid
to talk about why he's stepping down, what he's doing next, the future of AI.
He takes the gloves off, he talks about the dangers of centralized AI and the
potential for decentralized democratized AI to be the only avenue that truly
uplifts all of humanity. All right, if you liked this episode please subscribe.
Let's jump in. If you're a mood shot entrepreneur this is an episode you're
not gonna want to miss. All right now on to Emaid. Good morning Emaid. Good to see
you my friend. Actually it's always pizza. So you and I were on stage literally last
week at the 2024 Abundance Summit talking about the whole open source AI
movement. You were beginning to talk about decentralized AI. You were talking
about where stability was, the speed of the development of the different products
and the day after the Abundance Summit was over the news hit that you had stepped
down as CEO of Stability and stepped off the board. So let's begin with the
obvious question. Why? What happened and I have huge respect for you and I know a
lot of the issues in the past but I'd like you to have a chance to share with
entrepreneurs out there and folks interested in AI exactly your side of
what's happening. Yeah, thanks. I think that Elon Musk once characterized being a
CEO as staring into the abyss and chewing glass because you are looking at a
very uncertain future having to make decisions and the chewing glass is all
the problems that come to you all the time and it's required to steer the ship
when things are incredibly uncertain and stability is a pretty unique company
unique time like we hired our first developer and researcher two years ago
and then in those two years we built the best models of almost every type except
for large language image audio 3d etc and had over 300 million downloads of
the various models we created and supported which was a bit crazy and
then gent of AI is crazy in terms of usually in a startup you don't have to
deal with global leaders and policy debates about the future of humanity
and AGI and everything else at the same time of building code. Yeah at the same
time as building code yes and especially be a building code to fraction all the
resources of our competitors like we had certain teams offered triple their
entire packages to move to other companies. Yeah I was grateful that only a
couple of researchers before I kind of now suddenly I was going to leave left
for other companies and that was just startups no one left for another big
company which I think is testament to that kind of morality in the mission
but you know what we've seen over the last year is or last half year in
particular is the question of governance in AI it's something that's incredibly
important and who manages owns controls this technology and how they're
distributed so we saw you know everything from kind of open AI to congressional
testimonies to other things and as you know one of my things has always been
how do we get this technology in the hands of people all around the world
and then who governs it and how can we then take this technology to have an
impact from education to healthcare to others. The stability is a company that
build great base models and we go and we got to that point the revenue is going up
which is always nice you know finding the business model and again I think
it was always curious to see that as a deep tech company two years in people are asking us
you know why aren't you profitable and I was like it takes a bit of time and
investment to get to profitability. I think opening AI when they took they're not there yet
but then they have eight years I think all the comparisons are perhaps unfair
so reviewing everything and kind of looking at it I was like do I really want to be a CEO?
I think the answer is no. I think there is a lot imbued in that in tech but it's a very
interesting position. Just to dive into that a second because we've had this conversation
because there was a lot of pressure asking whether for you to step down as CEO
and I think founders typically want to see themselves or feel they need to be the CEO
and I've heard you say recently you know that you view yourself more as a founder and strategist
than the CEO is that a fair assessment? Yeah I think everyone's got their own skill sets right
so I'm particularly great at taking creatives, developers, researchers, others and achieving
their full potential and designing systems but I should not be dealing with you know HR and
operations and business developments and other elements they're probably better people than me
to do that. So now for example our most popular thing is stable diffusion and come for UI the
system around it is the most widely used image software models in the world. They're a great
media CEOs they can take that and amplify that to make hundreds of millions of revenue so they
should come in and meet on that. So why now pal what is there anything that specifically
tipped for you that has I mean because you know it has you know you have done an extraordinary
job this has been your baby I mean you have to feel a whole slew of emotional elements and I've
had to step down as CEO on two occasions over the 27 companies I've had to sell a company for
pennies on the dollar and it takes an emotional hardship on you. Yeah I've had calls for me to
step down and see uh since the well since 2022 you know but I always thought you know what's
best for the company in the mission and where I look at the world right now there's a few things
a the company has momentum it has spread it's turning into a business like last year I said
let's not enter into larger revenue contracts because technology isn't mature yet and our
processes aren't mature here and you have to deliver so we do a lot of experimental things
we're setting up and again now it's ramping on a business side on the technology side the technology
is maturing diffusion transformers such as stable diffusion 3 and saura are going to be the next big
thing and against a bit she's got a great place there but I think there's also the macro on this
so if you look at the open AI CEO gourd thing you know sam altman said the board can fire me
anytime this is the governance of open AI and then they fired him and then he is back on and he
appoints himself back on the board there's clearly no governance open AI I mean I respect the people
on the board greatly you know I think there's some great individuals but who should manage the
technology that drives humanity and teaches every child and manages our government who's
really leading on that that can build these models and do those things as you know I've always wanted
to build the science models and the other health teams done that I want me doing the education
work and then my concept of a national model for every country owned by the people of the country
all tied together I think it needs to be by a web 3 not crypto or necessary token framework
that's something that's a brand new kind of challenge and one that I think there's only
a window of a year or two to do if you have highly capable models let's put aside a joke
for now which you can discuss later really accelerating then no one will be able to keep
up with that unless you build in a decentralized manner and distributed manner for data talents
distribution standards and more so there's only a small window of time here to do that and realistically
go successful companies and these things are all great but genetify is a bit bigger than the
classical norms just like the whole lifecycle of the company was a lot faster than the classical
norms so that's why I felt you know now is the right time to make that change and hopefully
play my part in making sure this technology is distributed as widely as possible and governed
properly as pretty much I think I'm the only real independent agent that has built state of the art
models in the world right now yeah we've seen a lot of turbulence with open AI we just saw
Mustafa from inflection become part of Microsoft and I am curious I mean you you had a now famous
conversation with Satya a couple of days after stepping down was that investigatory on your
part or was that just a touch base with an old friend oh that's just chill trolling actually
you know like to let us in steam that picture was I think from when year or two a year or so ago
but you know I think Satya is an amazing CEO and you know he responds again like the top
CEOs incredibly quickly when you message he's got a great vision but there is again this concern
about consolidation in tech we didn't take money from any trillion dollar companies
at stability you know we remained and retained full independence you know and you know to the
detriment of some of the elements that we could have taken very big checks and other things
and even though you have good attention to everyone that companies are slight
slow dumb ai's that over optimize for various things and that's most certainly in the best
interest of humanity when you have infrastructure it's like this is the airports the railways the
roads of the future ai is an infrastructure generally an infrastructure which should be
and should it be consolidated under the control of a few private companies with unclear objective
functions again the people in the companies may be great I don't think so and this is a key concern
and part of that was that commentary again he's doing an amazing job he's consolidating a lot of power
for the good of the company and also he has a I think genuinely good heart
omission to bring technology to the world but it is a bit concerning right especially with
the new types of structure you're speaking of Sam in this case no Satya here or Satya like again
I think the commentary was always interesting like you know Satya playing 40 chests you know
assembling the ai Avengers I mean he is he's building an amazing mass of talent covering the
bases and Microsoft is doing incredibly well here right if you asked who's doing best to join
tomorrow people would say Microsoft but there is has to be concerns about consolidation of talent
and power and reach before I get to your vision going forward because it's so important and what
you're doing next I just again as a founder as a CEO of a moonshot company we have a lot of those
listening here can ask how are you feeling right now because the decision to step down
has to have huge emotional are you feeling relief are you feeling anxiety what's what's the feeling
after making a momentous decision I was a big feeling of relief
um you know because there's the there's a Japanese concept Ike guy I know Ike guy and
I love it yes yeah do what you go do what you like and do where you believe you're adding value
and other people do to you know like realistically again I think I was an excellent research leader
strategist other things I didn't communicate properly or hire the right other leaders in
certain other areas of the company and they're better people to do that and so I wasn't doing
what I was best at a lot or I could have the most measurable value and it was tying down you know
there's a lot of legacy you know technical organization or other debt especially when you
grow so so so fast and you know we were lucky that we had higher attention in the important areas
and we could execute in spite of all of that in spite of going to big company around I think
you know moonshot founders you have to do because you don't have the resources at the start and
you have to guide the ship you know as it goes out from port but there does come that transition
point there and there is a competing thing where you typically take on VC money which
holds an objective function versus your overall mission so again if you look at the genitive
AI world right now how many credible intelligent independent voices are there there they've had
the ability to build models and design things and make an impact you know there's not many so I was
like that's where I can add my most leverage and also the design space is again is unprecedentedly
huge because the entire market has just been created like where does gentry not fit and
when does it not touch and what needs to be built there we need to actually have the agency to go
and build that and so I felt tired relieved I felt that now there's a million options I want it
rather than taking a long break get on with things I've just done the first thing in kind of
web 3 and I've got a whole bunch of other things we were going to discuss kind of coming and catalyze
stuff that can make an exponential benefit because you know like massively transformed to purpose
here is I want every kid to achieve their potential and give them the tools to do that and I love you
for that because you've been true to that that vision and I know on the heels of your announcement
you've been reached out to by national leaders by corporate you know by CEOs and major investment
groups and you have a lot of opportunity ahead of you so let's talk about where you want to go
next you mentioned publicly and you discussed on our abundance stage the idea of democratized and
decentralized AI let's define that first what is that why is it important and what do you want to do
there yeah I think that when I said I'm going to move to do my part in decentralizing AI people
like isn't that just open source you give the technology right and then anyone can use it but
it isn't AI decentralizing AI has a few important components one is availability and accessibility
everyone should be able to access this technology the fruits of labor and there's some very interesting
political and other elements around that number two is the governance of this technology do you
have centralized governance because the models are the data there's a recent data bricks thing
model where they show that you have massive improvements from data we all know that you know
who governs the data that teaches your child or manages your health or runs your government
that's an important question I think too few are asking and we need data transparency and other
things like that so accessibility you know you've got the governance aspect of that and then finally
you have how does it all come together is a single package or is it a modularized infrastructure
that people can build on and is available kind of everywhere you know does it require monoliths
and central servers where if it goes down you have an outage on GPT core you're a bit messed up
or someone can attack and co-opt it I think that those are kind of the key elements that I was
looking at when I was talking about decentralizing AI and you know I've come up with an infrastructure
to do that I hope as well so if you don't mind let's double click on it even further so
you mentioned we don't have long to get there if that's a true statement why don't we have long to
get there and then what does getting there look like if you had all the capital available and if
the right national leaders were hearing about this because a lot of this is supporting
the populace of a nation to have AI that serves them versus top down what's it look like
two five ten years from now yeah I think you'll have both proprietary and open source AI and
they'll work in combination the practical example I give is that the AI is like graduates right
very talented slightly enthusiastic graduates and you want those and consultants
um but I really you know on stage with Matt Friedman last week at 360 when we're there he
said it's like we discovered this new concept what do you call it AI Atlantis yes yes with 100
billion graduates that will work for free yes I love that analogy it was it was a brilliant
analogy yeah we used to figure out how to say Atlantis you know um but but there's a few things
here first of all is the defaults you know once a government embraces centralized technology
it's very difficult to decentralize it and every country needs an AI strategy a year ago
one year ago was GPT-4 yeah crazy how crazy is that you know at the AI safety summit uh in the UK
the king of England came on stage or came via video call and he said that this is the biggest
thing since fire you know and that was like what six seven months later where are we going to be in
here yeah I think he took that from uh from uh the founder of the CEO of Google
AI is as powerful as fire and electricity yeah yeah I've heard the same from like Jeff Bezos
and a bunch of others you know not kindle fire proper fire you know um but then if you think
about it norms are going to be set in this next period like you know I'm in California LA at the
moment if you don't set norms on rights for actors and the movie industry then you could
have a massive disruption just occurring this full length Hollywood features come in a year or two
generated you know if you don't have norms around open models and ownership and governance by the
people it'll be top-down governance because governments can't allow that to be out of control
if they don't have a reasonable alternative um and I think the window is only a year or two
because every government must have a strategy by the end of the year and so I think if you provide
them a good solution that has this element of democratic governance and others that will be
immensely beneficial I think also it's urgent because we have the ability to make a huge difference
you know as we kind of may probably discuss later and we want the knowledge of cancer longevity
autism at your fingertips you know the technology for that right now you have the technology that
no one ever is ever alone again on those things or to give every child a superior education literally
in a couple of years like there is an urgency both from there's a small window but also from
we must do this now because it can scale and make that impact we have dreamed of for so long
the enabling technology is finally you know it's finally good enough fast enough and cheap enough
everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's very important
to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love company is called
fountain life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented
physicians you know most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body we're all
optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side you go to the physician in the emergency
room and they say listen I'm sorry to tell you this but you have this stage three or four going on
and you know it didn't start that morning it probably was a problem that's been going on
for some time but because we never look we don't find out so what we built at fountain life was
the world's most advanced diagnostic centers we have four across the US today and we're building 20
around the world these centers give you a full body MRI a brain a brain vasculature an AI enabled
coronary CT looking for soft plaque dexa scan a grail blood cancer test a full executive blood
workup it's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive 150 gigabytes of data that then go to our
AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable you're gonna
find out eventually might as well find out when you can take action fountain life also has an entire
side of therapeutics we look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10
20 healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers so if this is of interest to
you please go and check it out go to fountainlife.com backslash peter when tony and i wrote our
new york times bestseller life force we had 30 000 people reached out to us for fountain life
memberships you go to fountainlife.com backslash peter we'll put you to the top of the list
really it's something that is um for me one of the most important things i offer my entire family
the CEOs of my companies my friends it's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans
go to fountainlife.com backslash peter it's one of the most important things i can offer to you as
one of my listeners all right let's go back to our episode so the let's talk about the objective
function of democratized and decentralized ai is it that the compute is resonant um in countries
around the world is it that the models are owned by the citizens of the world is it that data is
owned um and how do you get there from here i think that um you can think of the supercomputers
like universities you don't need many universities honestly if someone's building good quality models
that's one of the things that says stability and we did the hard task we could have just stuck with
image we said no we're gonna have the best 3d image audio biomedical all these models and no one else
managed that apart from open ai to agree in fact i think we have more modalities than open ai again
kind of want to kind of describe this group is accessibility and governance and a few of these
other factors so i think what it means is that this technology is available to everyone but you
see now that you don't assume you need giant supercomputers to even run it you know we showed
you a language model running on a laptop stable on m2 we'll run on a gigabyte on a mac macare
faster than you can read you know we're writing some poems various things you know um we see stable
diffusion now at 300 images a second or consumer graphics card our video model was like five gigabytes
of VRAM this really changes the equation because in web 2 all the intelligence was centralized on
these giant servers and big data now you have big supercomputers i think you'll need less with better
data training these graduates that can go out and customize to each country but they must reflect the
culture of that country like the japanese stable diffusion model we had if you typed in salary man
it gave you a very sad person versus the base model giving you a very happy person right so you
must have graduates that reflect the local culture and then reflect the local knowledge
and then global models again that reflect our global knowledge and can be answered by anyone
but who decides what goes in that these are some very important questions
and who vouchers for the quality as well what's your advice to a national leader because
you know we're now starting to see ministers of AI in different nation states and what
what's your advice to them right now in this area i think my advice to them would be to start
collecting the data sets that they would teach a graduate that was very smart through school and
kind of other things this is national broadcast data this is the curriculum this is their accounting
legal and others and note that those data sets are infrastructure they will enable the local
populace and others to create these models because models are just data wrapped in algorithms
and kind of compute that's the recipe compute algorithms and data and it's not going to be
as hard as you think to train these models but you have to build them to get standard so by the
end of next year probably year after i would estimate that a longer seven to be level model
or a stable diffusion model so these are two leading models in image and language will cost about
under ten thousand dollars probably even one thousand dollars to train and then it comes
all about the data and then it becomes about the standards you know it's it's it's interesting
there is so much knowledge in the world that will vaporize sublimate over the decade ahead
as people die you know cultural data locked up in people's minds and stories and so forth that's
never been recorded it's an interesting time to actually capture that data and permanently store it
into the national models yeah and again i think people over focus on the models versus the data
sets i mean is data set yeah yeah yeah with the exponential compute you can recalibrate and improve
the data as well so right now a lot of the improvements in models are actually synthetically
improving data and data quality um as you said there's so much that can be lost but now we can
actually capture this and the concepts and the other guidance and have cross checks like you can
deconstruct laws you know you can translate between contexts you can make expert information
available to everyone because again you have this new continent of ai at rantis and all these
graduates seem to be specialists that are on your phone and that's incredibly democratizing
you know um because otherwise the knowledge is throughout history knowledge has always been
gatecapped always i want to get to uh health and education next but before we go there i know you
were meeting with a mutual friend uh jules urbach yesterday um and instability announced a deal with
endeavor and render network um are you still an advisor to that venture you know this is part of
the whole thing it's the first of many web three kind of elements there i think web three is 95 percent
let's say 90 percent i'll be generous um speculative and rubbish but there is that five ten percent of
genuine people that'd be thinking about questions of governance coordination and others and have
built things that are proper so otto is the bridge to the creative industry you know that's
why we're with arie manuel and eric schmidt and others are on the board um and the render network
is a million gpus largely from creative professionals that are available and so the first thing i
announced there i was going to be initial 10 million gaps 250 million of distributed compute to create
the best 3d data sets like stability we funded and worked with allen institution others on objiverse
excel which was 10 million high quality 3d assets we're going to a billion distributed you don't need
giant supercomputers but then that is a community good that is owned by the people of the network
and accessible to non-academic and others as well why because you need high quality assets to create
better 3d models we have any 3d model tribe or style that can generate a 3d image from a 2d image
in a couple of five seconds and that 3d model feeds into better 3d assets and then what does that
mean it means we're heading towards the holodeck without the data you're not going to get there
and that jules jules wants the holodeck for sure yeah so you know jules and i are the same page of
that you know and you're not going to get there without again a commons of data that can train
the graduates that then become specialized with star trek or you know star wars or any of these
other ip's and then also setting standards around monetization ip writes all sorts of other things
and so a network like render is really good for that but you know i've been talking to a lot of
people in web 3 about the different elements of the stack because what i basically see is that
we have the opportunity to build almost a human operating system models and data sets for every
nation every sector coordinated through proper web 3 principles again not speculative tokens or
anything like that you know making it so that every child in the world or adult can create anything
they can imagine they can be protected against the harms and they have access to the right information
at the right time to thrive and again that's infrastructure for everyone it's a common good
access to gpus has been sort of the limited fuel um do you think decentralized gpu structures like
render is part of that future is an important part of that future i think right now it's far
more efficient to train models on these again big supercomputers the university but the rate of
exponential growth there again is insane last year to train lama 2 cost 10 million dollars
in a year or cost 10 000 dollars a thousand times improvement from algorithms data supercomputes
speeds and that's crazy if you think about it right um so i think this will be the limiting
factor i think the gpu overhang four language models probably lasts until the end of the year
but then there's plentiful supply because what you have is nvidia makes amazing gpu is an 83 or 87
percent margin right but the actual calculations aren't complicated like we took intel gpus and we
ran the stable diffusion three diffusion transformer training so this is the same technology that's
used in saura and stable diffusion three is multimodal so it can train saura models within
african cube and i think us and them are the only people kind of doing this so i think maybe pixart
as well um and then it ran faster than the intel gpus than the nvidia gpus but we know that it can
run even faster because it's not optimized for either and it's still running fast so what you'll
see is a commoditization of the hardware once the architect just gets stabilized because gpd4 is just
a research artifact still diffusion was just a research artifact you're not going to be in the
engineering phase yet and you've got to the point whereby this runs on macbooks it runs on other
things so i think it's a short term phenomenon of the next year because people were taking a point
in time and extrapolating without taking into account efficiencies optimizations and the fact
that models that work on the edge and it can go to your private data will be more impactful than
generalized intelligence everyone's over indexing on generalized intelligence and building ai god
versus amplified human intelligence shall we say before we leave stability it's now in the hands of
the chair and your past cto what's what do you imagine the future of stability
is going to be going forward i know that you're not involved anymore it's under different leadership
and there's a what's your advice to them or where do you think they're going to go
you know i can do the very basic advice i didn't want any conflicts or anything because i'll be
setting up lots of new companies and you know being a founder and a shareholder and against
stability i'm a founder shareholder in fact you're still the majority shareholder i think
i said right now just about just about yeah that will change i'm sure new money will come in like
we saw co here yesterday on i think 20 million of revenue run rate they're raising at five billion
money's plenty crazy yes yeah with the right leadership i think that um it can again have
an amazing part to play in media and that's what i've suggested to it um and again there's a great
team that continues to ship great models so last week there was an amazing code model next week
amazing language audio and other models are coming out so you know you continue shipping
and great products around that too um so that was kind of my advice to them let's focus on media
and take that forward but you know i'm not the expert on the business side of things i did the
best i could my expertise on setting this up but take it 0 to 10 and uh yeah zero zero one is is
definitely um a role that that you've played here and allow it allow someone else to take it the
rest of the way uh but the area that i know actually there's something i wanted to kind of
discuss here that thing's quite important please or again the founder's listing and the moonshot
companies um there is an imbalance of power when you have very visionary highly competent leaders
there like what i found its stability is that everyone would be waiting for me no matter how
competent because i was the one that could see around the corners and i was a bit good at everything
even if i hired people that built billion dollar startups or were leaders and research at google
kind of whatever um because you have an outside thing this is what kind of better says you have
to speak last in some cases and some people are meeting because otherwise everyone just does everything
you say and they also wait on you now what i find and what i tell the team is that your
flat as a power dynamic you're all on the same page you're all kind of relatively equal owners
and it'll be interesting to see how it evolves from that uh given that there's actually a business
and again i think this is something that you probably had a challenge with other founders here
whereby they put more on your plate because you are so visionary and because you're like up there
in the future and they're always waiting on you so you're always like well my schedule is completely
packed my schedule now is actually quite free which is also quite nice i've had a chance to speak
with you every day for the last few days so that's been a pleasure to have extra time on your schedule
you know so so we we do have a world of uh visionary founder led CEO companies right so
you've got musk and you've got bezos historically and you had steve jobs and you and and that's
both powerful and dangerous the the power is the ability for that because we don't ever have a company
that is pre-existing a new CEO comes in and has the same um uh both hootspa and and also
the power of their of their vision um the danger there you're concerned you're you're saying is
not not allowing your team to step up with their own vision or being overly indexed on your on your
vision yeah i think that that can be the issue and that's why i wanted stability to again reach the
point of spread and revenue rate increase and other things before i do anything um i felt again
this external pressure in that if nobody or there's very few people in the world actually
thinking properly about governance and spread and others and a very small window giving the pace of
this to make a difference in the dent i believed i had a reasonable approach to that but i couldn't
while remaining CEO of this company and again it's a pretty unique scenario because you've
never seen a sector move this fast that has such wide-reaching human implications and regressively
there's too few people i think with the right alignment and approach in this area i've been
very disappointed like usually what happens is you have power maximization equations and this is
what we're seeing from the industry consolidation how many people want to genuinely bring this
technology to kids in nigeria or to the global south or to help those leaders build their own
models you know and believe also in a positive sum game that was actually my biggest surprise from
the discussions to lincoln valley almost entirely they all believe in a flat or negative sum you know
zero sum or negative sum things where there has to be a winner everyone's a winner in this
and again i was just very disappointed seeing that i've been asking for you for a while to write
and distribute your vision white paper because i've heard you describe it in detail and it's
brilliant and i still hope that the world will see it soon enough everybody you want to take a
break from our episode to tell you about an amazing company on a mission to prevent and reverse
chronic disease by decoding your biology the company is called viome and they offer cutting-edge tests
and personalized products that help you optimize your gut microbiome your oral microbiome and your
cellular health as you probably know your microbiome is a collection of trillions of microbes that live
in your gut and mouth these microbiomes influence everything your digestion immunity mood weight
and many other aspects of your health but not all microbes are good for you some can cause
inflammation toxins and actually lead to chronic diseases like diabetes heart disease obesity and
even cancer viome uses advanced mRNA technology and ai to analyze your microbes and your cells and
give you personalized nutrition recommendations and products designed specifically for your genetics
specifically for your biology you can choose from different tests depending on your goals and needs
ranging from improving your gut health your oral health cellular function or all of them
i've been using viome for the past three years i can tell you that it has made a huge difference
in my health and because the data they collect and the ai engine they've built it gets better
every single day i love getting health scores and seeing how my diet and lifestyle affects
my microbiome and my cells and i love getting precision supplements and probiotics tailored
for my specific needs if you want to join me on this journey of discovery and improve your health
from the inside out viome has a special offer for you for a limited time you can get up to 40
percent off any viome test using the code moonshots just go to viome.com backslash moonshots
and order your test today trust me you won't regret it all right let's go back to our episode
before we jump into into health and education let's talk about governance a second because
we've seen governance um complicate this what is the right governance structure for the super
powerful technology we have representation of democracy that i think can be improved by this
like i don't think democracy survives this technology it's current for it will either improve
or it'll end i don't see anything else like um yesterday though what does end what does end
mean here a benign dictatorship a driven by an ai overlord yeah like yesterday there was a
announcement of an app called hume which had emotionally intelligent speech and they can
understand your emotions and talk with emotion you don't have to discuss this yes you know where
that's going right it's very powerful speech it's incredibly powerful and governments have
a tendency i mean that if there's no government but sit but say it say it here it's important for
you to state what what it means because we've discussed it but help people here under be ready
for this in democracy is all about representation and you see the questions of deep fakes and things
speech is one of the rest impactful elements there but now you can't believe anything you see
everything so one path that we have is a 1984 on steroids panoptica you know
where life is gamified and you listen to whatever the government says and they're
incredibly convincing and you're happy and you've always been happy and you've always been at war
with eurasia you know propaganda on steroids the other path that you have is things like
citizen assemblies consults of democracy the ability to take right now you can take any
of the bills in congress and completely deconstruct them and find what the motivations are you know
you can check laws against the constitution in a second seconds this is incredibly powerful
empowering technology from a democratic perspective so i see two routes unfortunately because i think
that once the right thing goes it goes really fast centralized government control increasing
because the government want to protect themselves as an organization and you know
every party says the other parties crap we've seen the increasing polarization in america already
and you know fundamentally come on you can do better than those two leaders that are currently
competing i'm saying this is yes clear our system is sclerotic across this like democracy is the
worst of all systems except for everyone else you can have a better democracy where it's actually
representative and empowers the people or we will have the end of democracy where it is
and 1980 or panopticon in my opinion because the momentum will go then of course you'll start using
this technology you're already seeing it being used but not at scale and not intelligently yet
which is scary i think we finally have the technology for a direct democracy versus a
representative democracy right where i can have my my desires directly represented on any specific
law or but i think the point you've made before is that speech um if you look back to
everybody from hitler to some of the most persuasive politicians um is is a powerful
tool and ai can become the most persuasive speaker out there it can take anyone's speech
to make it far more persuasive like i think my voice is a bit whiny i can remove the wine
you know i can go in a very polished british accent and other things like that right you know
must fight them on the hills and the harriers and whatever public speaking needs to be different
someone took hitler's speeches and put them through an ai and took them into english because when we're
not in the german context and we listen to them it sounds like he's shouting like well that's
crazy thing you hear him in english it is very different in his own voice just like someone
took javier mle's one in the united nations and put him into english again he sounds a bit
sharp how shouty but then he sounds very reasonable when it's in english and you can take the phenomes
of obama's best speech and a bit of trumpianism and a bit of church hill and you'll have full
modulation wave control over all of this people are already using this technology that everyone
should have a passcode with their loved ones because people are getting calls from their mother
saying help i'm in an emergency and you just send money right now and you cannot tell it and it
pulls at the emotional strengths and if you look at something like u.s radio and you know one side
of the political divide is taking over imagine if you're eerie optimized speech every single day
that will have a huge impact and then they control the visuals and they control the other things
we're not set up for defenses yeah if it's if it's optimized speech for you specifically for you
right for the kids you have the age group they have where you live your historical background
and so forth and end of one persuasive speech coming at you um the brain is not set up for
defenses we're not and you know we take this as an example of the youtube algorithm like youtube
as an organization is not an evil organization but it's an organization optimized for engagement
which optimized for more extreme content so this is a dark place in youtube which is an
optimized for ices the ices video spread viral i don't know sometimes viral is good sometimes
viral is bad that one was bad because it was extreme and they didn't understand why and if
you look at it our two of our largest gen2 bi companies are google and meta and their business
is advertising their business is manipulation and they are both amoral companies because why
would you expect a company to have morality our governments are also amoral and again you can
view these things as slow dumb ai so you can see the way they will optimize unless we do something
about it and they will have full control like again you put on your vision pro headset with your
spatial audio that is full sensory control not full but you know what i mean of the level that we
have full immersion full immersion full immersion and so we have to be aware of this
and there's obviously other tools that can be used like in the wake of the ab spring you know
governments targeted everyone else in social media we can do that on a high and hyper personalized
basis like we need to set some defaults and standards here to protect democracy but again
why democracy we're not really trying to protect democracy you know again people have
different definitions that what we're trying to protect is individual liberty freedom and agency
education should be about enhancing the education of every child it's not you know healthcare is
sick care our government should uplift us but how many people believe our governments do that
rather than put us down because they couldn't encapsulate and cater to the brilliance of each
individual because they didn't have the tools until now so that's why i said which way one man
yes which way agency or massive control these are the two ways do we control the technology
or do these organizations control the technology that controls us you know when we were on the
stage at at the abundant summit we talked about a future of digital superintelligence right and
a future in which we've got AI a billion times more capable than a human which
looking at it just from a ratio of neurons is the ratio of a hamster to a human um yep
do you believe that someday we could have a a benign superintelligence that is supporting humanity
yes and i believe that it should be a collective intelligence that is made up or amplified human
intelligence is amplifying all of us pilots that contain our collective knowledge and culture and
the best of us and datasets that are built from helping and augmenting us versus a collected
intelligence and agi that is top-down and designed to effectively control us again if you look at
open ai statements on the rote agi they say this technology will end democracy end capitalism
and maybe kill us all i don't like that i remember i remember seeing that you you texted me you said
read this does this sound the same as it does to me yeah so what i'd prefer instead is for this to
be distributed like if you have datasets formations that are built on enhancing the capability of the
nation that reflect the local cultures and you push for data transparency on models which i believe
we must have you know especially language models then you're more likely to have a positive thing
and again the human collective can achieve anything from splitting the atom to go into space
if we put our minds to it but we have lacked in coordination mechanisms they're not being good
enough so if you create the human colossus and every single person has an ai that's just looking at
put them to enhance their potential and coordination ai's that is a far more positive view of the future
and that is the agi that is a general intelligence that's the hive mind general intelligence not a
bog style hive mind but one that's really thinking again every child should achieve their potential
versus this embodied concept of an agi that's a very western concept and you see that as well like
you know we look at the japanese concept of a robot the robot is your equal and your helper
you look at the western concept of the robot it's terminator and skynet and all of that
and again i think this is again where cultural norms become very interesting and what do we
want to build do we want to build ai god or do we want to build that ai helper that helps us and we
help it you know um those listening now i mean you can see huma's brilliance and why i'm so enamored
with the way you think about this because it's there are very few individuals who are looking at
this from an objective function of what's best for humanity what's best for every nation state
uh out there let's talk about your going forward future um are you going to build something in the
in the decentralized um uh side of of ai the democrat side size of ai is there a company
there or a fund in your future for that yes so uh you're not doing the white paper finally
getting there with a bit of help from ai uh i can't i can't i can't wait to uh to help
broadcast that white paper yeah but look i think the basic thing is this what i want to do is set up
a ai champion in every nation with the brightest people of each nation working with the organization
of each nation to help guide them through this next period because there'll be massive job
displacement from the graduates going massive uplift some productivity from the technology
being implemented and again that organization can help govern and create these data sets and
these models that are so important and i think every nation should have that but then i also
believe that every sector should have a genitive ai first infrastructure company that builds this
and helps the healthcare companies finance companies and others through that to coordinate
all of that you need to have a web three type protocol what is the protocol for intelligence
so what what is a web what is a web three type protocol to find that for folks listening again
people talk about web three it's not about the tokens or the meme coins or anything like that
what about three protocol is is that everyone should have like ai's first of all aren't going to
have bank accounts they're going to need some way to pay each other or exchange value and again
web three is a lot of work in that there needs to be some sort of identity attribution and other
format because you'll have this massive flux of information and so again web three concepts are
very useful there there needs to be an identity concept because you'll have real and digital
people web three concepts are very useful there so data access station all these other things
verifiability so when i look at it if you've got sectorally my plan is to launch a company for every
major sector and we can talk about health and education and bring the smartest people in the
world to solve that challenge of the infrastructure for the future every nation but you need to have
some sort of coordinating protocol for all of that that becomes a standard and that's the substrate
for this amplified human collective intelligence and and is that where you want to play and focus
your energy next yeah it's setting up these organizations and bringing the brightest smartest
people that really want to make a difference there because there's massive network effects in
doing this but again i just need to be the founder and architect i don't want to run the day to day
of any of these things um and then because the the most scarce talent there's three types of
capital as i view it there's financial capital human capital and political capital and in order to
affect change in the world you actually need all three but the financial capital actually comes with
the people capital and the political capital and the smartest people in the world in every sector
from health care to education to finance to agriculture almost all believe that gentry is
the biggest thing they've ever seen in the last year everyone's asking you all the smartest people
peter what's next right and you know many the smartest people in the world so i want to create
organizations that they can come the chefs and the cooks the thinkers and the doers and think
what is the future of finance that's the future of education and then the national champions that
should be owned by the people of each country become the distribution for the amazing infrastructure
they built and there's a vice a nice kind of vice versa but then again you need the coordination
function so i'm trying to bring together people in each of these and you know there'll be a
public calls and things like that to build that infrastructure the future because as mentioned
ai isn't infrastructure but it should be i mean maybe it's the rocket ship of the mind right
i love that i love that analogy my friend it is the most important infrastructure
that humanity will have going forward across everything it does and i look forward to helping
you build it exciting right like again i think one of the things i got i got lots of messages
that like i'm so sorry for your loss it was like my dog had died after i left to see you
i was like what is that you know they're like i was nice it's nice that people care right but
i'm generally excited about what's next like you know again it was like staring into the abyss
and chewing gloss every single day and that's not what i'm best at or where i could have the most
impact but i want it to be a point whereby if i can accelerate this over the next period i don't
have to make an impact i should not have any power on this whereas again you see everyone else
trying to get more and more power i want to make sure it's set up properly but i want to give it
all away because power is obligation it's dragging and again it should not be invested in any one
individual we shouldn't have to rely on anyone being nice or good for this technology i was talking
to michael sailor during the abundance summit that evening and you know talking about the fact that
because satoshi when he set it up uh did not retain any power and did not trade on the founding
blocks and so forth that that's the reason it's been able to succeed because there wasn't that
centralized power and you know bitcoin had been he said bitcoin had been tried many times before
but because it didn't have that initial anonymity and and and the dissolution of founding power
that that's the reason it didn't succeed yeah i mean again i think you need to have it accelerate
and you see this with movements right the movement starts but then it goes once you've got the dna
and the story there right you know you see the profits you see the leaders you see the others
but then it's about setting the framework correctly and reframing the concept this technology is not
going stability is a company that started two years ago above a chicken shop in london right
you know my first 20 employees i went to the job center and i said bring me people that have
overcome adversity and i will train them young graduates and six of them are still at stability
you know um like because it was a program and they're doing things from cyber security to run
super computers we only had like 16 17 phd's yet we built the state-of-the-art models in every
modality we built mind-reading models like mind's eye you know i remember that contributed to all
these things yet you're told it's impossible to compete we have shown it's not impossible to
compete that's a reframing the reframing is data versus models it's you don't need giant super
computers for everyone you just need to have a trusted entity to build it right yeah you know
and so i hope to kind of convey this and then figure out this organizational structure that can
proliferate so i can take the holiday so before we go further let's talk about one area of your
next chapter in life that we both have as a passion which is the use of generative AI in
health it's an area that you've given a huge amount of thought to and i think you're excited
about can you share what your vision is there yeah so i got into AI 13 years ago gosh i was a
programmer before for 23 years building large scale systems as a hedge fund manager and other
things well my son was diagnosed with autism and then i built an lp team to analyze all the
clinical literature and then looked at biomolecular pathway analysis of neurotransmitters
galbrain we used to make in the brain to repurpose drugs for him and went to macy's school which is
great n equals one and then i was one of i was lead architect from the one with covid AI projects
for the united nations long to stanford and others and then because they didn't get the technology
i was like wow we've got to build it ourselves but what is health you know again i think we
have this discussion a lot healthcare is sick care we don't have all the information that we
should have at our fingertips health assumes ergodicity a thousand tosses of the coin is
the same as the coin tossed a thousand times but we are all individual and across the world
there are amazing data sets that could be better because when you write down a clinical trial or
your own kind of experiences you lose so much information at the same time you don't have
all the information on cancer or autism multiple sclerosis at your fingertips in the
comprehensive authoritative and upstate way so when i look at the health operating system
we're going to build a gpt for open for cancer and it's going to mean that nobody is alone again
on that journey and loses that agency because they know comprehensive authority of state all the
knowledge but AI models today already outperform human doctors and empathy so they're not going to
be alone on that anymore yeah can i just double click on what you just said because it's really
important i've had so many people because of my role as chairman of fountain life who reach out and
say i just got diagnosed with this cancer or my brother or my sister or my wife and and there is
they're left with this decimating news and they're left googling um but a model that's able to have
the most cutting-edge information and then incorporate all their medical data and give them
advice in empathic fashion how far is that see a couple of years if we focus maybe even like
next year and that's amazing because for all of these topics that again we will have diagnosis
that it's superior we will have research augmentation because again even researchers
don't have all that knowledge at their fingertips and again this is public infrastructure and a
public good you know from primary care all the way through so that one is the open infrastructure
of the future where this technology can come again to your own data as well you have uh things
like melody and other things around homomorphic encryption federated learning that they were
trying to figure out how to preserve privacy we can run a language model on a smart phone right now
that can analyze all your data and then just feedback stuff to a global collective but people
are people so when i look at healthcare i see amazing data sets that we can activate by taking
the models to the data an infrastructure that we can build like we had checks agent with stanford
the top x-ray radio radiology model to build good standard things across the entire gamut of healthcare
so we actually get to healthcare versus sick care so we can make it so that everyone is empowered
to make the best decisions either as experts or individuals and make it so nobody is alone again
as well as increasingly data quality that will then feed better models that will then save lives
save suffering and again increase our potential like you've got a long journey behind you right
why don't you have all the latest knowledge of longevity at your fingertips at a GPT-4 level
right now that will happen over the next year we will launch stable health or whatever you decide
to call it and there will be the smartest people in each of these areas working on that so again
you're never like doesn't matter if you're with a hundred billion dollars and your kid has autism
ASD there's no cure there's no treatment there's nothing it doesn't matter how rich you are yet
we're just a little bit of effort right now we can build it as an open infrastructure for the
five percent of people in the world that know someone with autism the 50 percent of people in
the world that receive a cancer diagnosis of them or someone they love and they feel that loss of
agency so we're going to return agency to humanity that way and again it needs to be an open infrastructure
that they can then access private datasets and compensate them appropriately so everyone is
incentivized we need that fast yeah and and that's a beautiful vision it is again infrastructure
and one of the things that's so beautiful about it is guess what all eight billion people
we're all human we're all running the same software and the the the breakthroughs and the
knowledge accumulated in you know Kazakhstan is going to be as useful in Kansas yeah
but this is the thing operating system this is the biggest upgrade to the human
operating system we can imagine because we're going from analog to digital text is black and
white whereas this these models only understand context you know Daniel Kahneman just passed you
know amazing kind of guy but you know he did have this concept of type one type two thinking
and so we had one which is these big data things that can only extrapolate but now we have these
models that understand context and so we have the missing parts of the brain and that will allow us
to extrapolate allows to have more rainbows you know have the context of each individual push
intelligence to the edge and that's why again there is this imperative to do this now because
there's a window on the freedom agency democracy side but the other imperative is no one should
have to suffer as they're suffering now amazing and how much does actually it doesn't need that
much which is the really amazing stuff this the total amount spent in Joan Tiber I think I said at
the conference is less than the total amount spent on the Los Angeles San Francisco Railway
which hasn't even started yet and and in building stable health again if that's what it's called
I mean the amount of capital required to build that is de minimis compared to what's spent
on a single human trial of any any drug yeah it is but then you know you build it and you get to
that 80 20 incredibly quickly that will change hundreds of millions of lives and that will attract
the smartest people in each of these areas think about what is the open infrastructure of multiple
sclerosis of longevity of cancer and more but then you can amp that because the value is so so huge
and you I hope to build a trusted organization as part of this whole human operating system upgrade
yeah that's what I want to build I want to build human OS well at least catalyze it again I don't
want to run or control or anything I want to give back that control because who should decide
what cancer knowledge goes and who should decide what education etc let's talk about the second
half of your of your vision which is how we originally met when you were one of the winners of
the global learning XPRIZE that Elon and Tony Robbins had had co-funded your your vision around
education um to speak to us about that yeah you know so we're deploying it um kind of the
winners are kind of separate but every child right my my entire operating system is like
if you think about things in terms of the rights of child and today they have no agency
and so we must respect their rights climate everything becomes a lot simpler now that we
have language models on a laptop like I said you can go to lmstudio.ai download stable lm
and it will run on your macbook faster than you can read it's crazy we can have a GPT4 level AI
from us or someone else on a smartphone or a tablet by next year one laptop per child was too early
you know now we have this transformative technology you have an AI that teaches the child
learns from a child are your visual auditory dyslexic that's the best data in the world for a
national model but also to teach these models how to be optimistic how to this really is this
really is uh the young lady's illustrative primer this really is neil stevensson's vision
in that regard yeah but nell shouldn't have had to find the primer she should have had it from day one
as a human right as a human right yes our school's education system our child care mixed with the
social status game mix with petri dish you know they teach our kids not to have agency
yes whereas they should be telling the kids yeah yeah they should be teaching this is a
running of the industrial age where everyone had to be counted and you can't measure what you
can't manage so you manage the creativity and belief out of people everyone in the world can do
anything why because even if you don't have that talent you can convince someone else who does have
that talent but they don't believe it so they can't do it so what happens if we have an entire nation
of children that have this helper that brings the right information the right time and tells them
they can always believe that supports them entire world what can't you do you know then they have
all of the cancel knowledge of their fingertips and all of the engineering knowledge of their
fingertips and it's a constantly learning adaptive and improving system again right now almost the
entire agi and ai debate is about these machine gods train on giant supercomputers that bestow
their beneficence down or may kill us or whatever what about that human operating system upgrade
that is a decentralized intelligence where that kid in longolio malawi or whatever can make a real
difference to humanity some of the contributors to our open code basis for our models of 15 years old
yeah they just taught themselves and just happen to be their wizards you don't know in this new age
right and again they should contribute to the whole because once something goes into this model
of the system and again it needs the verification and other things that can be dynamic they can
proliferate to everyone using that system do you think that once this capability is built it will
run into blocks in different nations or do you imagine that this will become a again a human
right uh and not all nation i mean listen there's no greater gift and no greater asset you can give
to a nation's populace than intelligence and education but i'm not sure every national leader
wants to see that that's why i think again there is a gap here there's a year maybe where you can
go to any national leader and say i open this technology to your people and i will empower
the smart sewer people i want to be owned by the people and what option do they have this is positive
for them what happens is that a lot of the corruption in the world is because of local maxima
you know actually it's weird because unpredictable corruption is the worst predictable corruption is
a bit like tax you know there's a good boast book by a fuss or a job about harvard about this
and then you have taxation kicking at 14 percent um if you can show them something bigger and this
is clearly big they will embrace this technology and set new norms and if you prep the same across
all these countries with talented individuals in each of those groups and talented individuals
in each of those sectors with a shared mission even though they're separate organizations that's
how you set amazing standards that's how you build a network effect and if you tie them all together
with a intelligent protocol and you want to talk about tokens or speculation or ramps or anything
like that but taking the best of thinking around coordination that can work that can break this open
you know um but it's not going to be everywhere and also when you look at the current debate the
current debate is for example we can't let china have this technology and you're like what about
the kids in china right well you know it's dangerous they can have agi so under what
circumstance would china ever have this technology never you know pakistan when should they have the
technology never that's really what they're kind of saying it's also self-defeating because china
has a hundred million people they can use to create data sets and two exaplots of computers
let's put that to the side again it's a very western oriented debate whereas actually if you
go to these countries and you talk to the leaders and the family officers that have power and the
people they will leapfrog in the global south to an intelligence augmentation like they let
frog to mobile they want to embrace this technology and again you can set norms now versus what's
going to happen is you know they will get a centralized solution they'll adopt that instead
if you don't right now for hundreds of millions billions of people that's why i think again it's
a crossroads um is there anybody else working towards the solution that you know of no in the
large ai panel no certainly no one credibility and again that's why i had to build these models
you know and i had to kind of do this everyone's working on tiny parts of this but there is
expecting emergence build it and somehow it will spread and again this is why i found it fascinating
the web3 community there are good people in there and i hope to be able to unite them just like
hope to unite the people in health and others and peter you've seen people working on tiny parts of
this but this isn't a manhattan project where we're facing an enemy unless the enemy is ourselves
you know but this does require this big global coordinated push and that's why i've tried to
design this system i believe will work because it's all about the talent and it is multiplicative
is the race against uh overly powerful centralized ai systems that achieve some
version of agi is that what we're racing against
yeah again we're racing against ourselves like humans can scale through stories you have
organizations you know come and join abundance come and go to oxford come and do this but then
when we scaled through text text was a lossy information format and there's this poem by
ginsburg how about this carthaginian demon of disorder mollock that comes in
mollock comes in through the data loss our organizations are slow dummy eyes
but now what's happening is they're configuring to achieve the thing of getting more and more power
again corporations are technically a people under law but they're not fully formed people
they eat our hopes and dreams so i believe the competition here is against those organizations
consolidating too much power and creating norms that almost impossible to break so we're almost
competing against ourselves and again the question is this do you believe it amplified human
intelligence or do you believe in artificial general intelligence do you believe in collective
intelligence or do you believe in collected intelligence who decides is this infrastructure
or is this a product like so it's not like a manhattan project against you know the soviets
or anything like that but it this is require us all to come together or at least the smartest people
in each of these areas from coordination to government systems to health care to education
with a blank slate of how do we upgrade the human operating system the time is now
it's our last chance to do it and i and i i love you for it because i think you're you're right
you were there when elan beamed in on xx video over starlink and from his airplane which is
which was a fun moment and we were talking about the rate of growth and his his statement
because you know rick heres why was there talking about his still his prediction of
agi by 2029 and rate and written elan saying we'll have agi whatever that means by next year and
and the intelligence of the entire human race by 2029 so i am i am curious what just to close
out what you think about that those timelines and that potential for a super intelligent
ai system that is centralized because that's the people who are building that level of power
are building centralized systems they're building centralized single systems that
again take our collective intelligence like all of youtube in the case of open ai clearly
and other things and they package it up sell it back to us but they don't give they don't care
you know these organizations are trying to build a system that will take away our freedom
liberty and potentially kill us all let's be quite a fair about that and sell it to us at
on an incremental basis the selling to us is a complete conod they don't care about the revenue
of this again let's kind of call a spade a spade they are telling you that they're building something
that could kill you and something that could remove all our freedom and liberty and they're
saying it's a good thing you should back them because it's cool it's not it's actually shameful
if you think about it and we should not stand for it anymore and again this is another reason
i want to step aside to see yeah because you can't say things like that i don't cancel until i can
rally so many times but realistically it's ridiculous and it should not be stood for
but they're going to do it anyway because they have the political power people are scared of them
so there has to be an alternative and the alternative has to be distributed intelligence
when i resigned i said you can't beat centralized intelligence essentialized intelligence you're
not going to beat it with a stability so this is a great organization it's going to do well
the only way that you can beat it to create the standard that represents humanity is decentralized
intelligence it's collective intelligence and the data sets and norms from that will be ones that
help children that help people suffering that reflect our moral upstanding and the best of us
and gathers the best of us to do it because if you work in health care if you work in education if
you work in finance if you work in any of these things there's no organization for you to come
join or partner with on this there's no kind of centralized mission i have looked i've wanted
to help other people i didn't want to do this myself and i don't want it to be about being
very very quickly and so i'm kind of getting it out there now i hope that i can capitalize
something that then people will take forward and time is now for that because agi when it comes
if it comes again there's various definitions of this why on earth do you need any knowledge
workers anything that can be done via a laptop doesn't need humans and so you have concepts of
ubi here you have concept like when agi comes you don't need money money is a common story is a common
good we hear towards a post capitalist society and i think the example i think you said was a
star trek versus mad max you know i'm like star trek versus star wars i think there's
a bit of a better one there you know and so you've got the sith lords and all of that
but again if you kind of look at this i don't think we need money like it's cross contextual
like bartering with our ai systems representing us or it's you don't need money because you're told
what to do again our governments the definition of a government is the entity with a monopoly on
political violence and an agi can overtake any government that they can they control the people
because again listen to it whispering look at the kind of human thing so we have this opportunity
to set norms right now the way that the big labs are going to agi is likely to kill us all
elon and i signed that six month pause letter because even though people like emma do an
acceleration as you put all this open source aia you have to think about the other side and who's
involved in that discussion and again if we build an agi as a centralized thing is windows or linux
safer as infrastructure our entire internet infrastructure is built on open open can be
challenged open can be augmented a monolith is likely to be crazy and the way that i put this is
we all know so many geniuses you know side effect of genius is insanity honestly we're not meant
geniuses are not mentally stable why would you expect an agi to be so and you're putting all
your ends in one basket versus creating a complex hierarchical system that is a hive mind that's
intelligence that represents us all we should be working towards building that bring it safer it's
better it achieves all the benefits that people are talking about and it's possible today do you
think elon shares in this vision of a decentralized ai do you think he would play in that area and do
you think any of the national leaders that you've been speaking to would support that kind of a
vision as well um yeah i can't speak for you i'll speak to him and see what he thinks then
i'll get back to you know he always says what he thinks um but you know he's immensely concerned
he was on the leaders in this area say originally why google you know now why in microsoft open ai
like it can't be centralized but it's difficult this is a difficult question how many people have
a feasible solution or you've even thought about this properly you and i both know just not many
and that's very sad should be everyone thinking about this on the leader side all the leaders i've
met are super happy you know because they again leaders want power they want control and all of
this but generally like they want to see a bundles they're not happy with where their countries are
and embracing this technology they know that they can leap ahead and you know they will still have a
say in all of this it's not like it's kicking them out or removing them there are still various
kind of mechanisms there and ultimately improving the health education and capability of your people
is not a bad thing i mean like obviously i haven't talked to the completely oppressive leaders you
know maybe that'll be an interesting thing but honestly i don't want to even be talking to leaders
i want to create again a system where the people of the country coming together with the franchise
system can then build this technology for the good of their people in the open and not be reliant on
anyone politically or any other type of thing like that you don't need giant super computers for
where we go we coordination in a few giant super computers yeah what's your timeline for putting
out this white paper i'm working as hard as i can you know i've held i've held i've held you to this
a number of times i've said get the vision out there it's getting there we're about to go off
this call to a four hour session to dictate all the various bits and pieces and again it was
impossible when i was a CEO of stability there was always another fire there's always another thing
i didn't have time to think you know and i hope people can take that white paper and make it
better i don't have all the answers i'm just trying to capitalize something though i think after i
heard you step down i wrote you a text saying congratulations yeah exactly not commiserations
time to time to feel unleashed yeah yeah uh imad thank you my friend uh thank you for sharing uh
where you are what led up to this where you're going next and uh and really pulling the gloves
off on discussing the idea of centralized closed ai systems and their dangers uh and the importance
of of the vision that you portrayed because i'm i'm fully supportive and fully believe that what
you've laid out um is probably one of the most seen visions of ai in the future that i've heard
i hope other people agree you know and they can take it forward
another real heroes thank you thank you pal
