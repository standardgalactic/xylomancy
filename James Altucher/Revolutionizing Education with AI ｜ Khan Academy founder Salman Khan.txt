Oh my gosh, I've been wanting to have this guy on my podcast for literally 10 years ever since I
started this podcast. I am so impressed with him and he speaks about a subject near and dear to
my heart. So Salman Khan, Sal Khan is the creator of the Khan Academy, which was really the first
big online academy. It was to learn math, coding, all these things and there was generating people
who really learned the topics as opposed to people who go all through 10 years of school and never
learned these topics at all or the schools failed to teach them appropriately. The Khan Academy
really seemed to understand education and it became this huge thing. 150 million students have gone
through the Khan Academy or use it every month or there's that number of registered users. Salman
Khan, Sal Khan, and he just wrote the book about how AI will revolutionize education. The book is
called Brave New Words, how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. And he
addresses how to use AI with education, whether you're a student, teacher, employer, it was so
valuable in terms of understanding not only education, but AI and how we can use AI on our
lives and it addresses all the fears people are having right now about AI and its role in
creativity and learning and will it replace jobs or will it make it easier to get a job.
So Brave New Words, how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. I finally
got to interview Sal Khan about the Khan Academy and AI and I learned so much and I hope you will as
well. This isn't your average business podcast and he's not your average host. This is the James
Altiger Show. Sal, can I start off by asking you a question that is peripherally related to the
book, but you do mention this towards the end of the book, which is there was one line that
I was curious about and it was like a personal thing, but you brought it up in the book.
Sure. So you mentioned that you thought your dad, who you didn't really know, you met him,
he left early, your parents separated when you were very young and you only met him once, you
know, he passed away when you were around 14 years old, but you said he probably suffered from
depression and I was curious why you thought that. You know, I don't have,
no one told me that, so I don't have any strong, well, the evidence is he kind of disappeared and
when, the one time I met him when he was, when I was 13, we briefly went to his place and
let's just say it looked like he was down and then it seems to fit with a lot of the narrative
of what at least what we've observed from my end. What were the circumstances of the visit,
like why did you visit him? You know, I was 13 years old. I don't remember. If I remember
correctly, he had, I guess a cousin of mine who I don't know my father's side of the family that
well, a nephew of his, who really wanted to put him in touch with us again and I forgot all the
context. I think we were up in, he was living in Philadelphia at the time, so we were up in that
area anyway and so this, this cousin, older cousin than me, you know, probably 20 years older than
me, facilitated this, you know, us, us to get together and to me and my sister and then we,
you know, we spent an evening together. Well, I was just curious about that particularly
since you brought it up in the book, but look, I've been incredibly impressed with, with everything
you've done, the Khan Academy, you know, 155 million users, you know, so many people have learned from
the videos on the Khan Academy, the educational style of the Khan Academy
and I know people know the story and it's not central to the book also, but maybe, you know,
if you could spend a few minutes describing how you started this, like it started apparently,
you were, you were tutoring one of your cousins, Nadia, about math and then other cousins knew,
hey, Sol's available for some free tutoring. We'd, you know, we want to, we want to help
and so you started creating tools and technology and videos and this grew into the Khan Academy.
Yeah, that's generally right. It was back in 2004. I, my original background was technology.
By 2004, I'd gone to business school. I was a year out. I was now working as an analyst at a
hedge fund. I had just gotten married in New Jersey and I was living in Boston and my family
from New Orleans, which is where I was born and raised, were up visiting in the Northeast and
they came to, some of them came to Boston for the July 4th weekend. This was 2004 and just came
out of conversation that my cousin Nadia was having trouble in math. Her mom told me, her my aunt,
and that's when I offered to, when I learned more about what was going on with Nadia, I offered
to tutor her and Nadia agreed. And as you mentioned, well, first of all, that, that tutoring seemed
to work with her. She was struggling with unit conversion, got her caught up even ahead of her
class and, you know, I joke sometimes I became a tiger cousin at that point. I call up her school,
they let her retake placement exams. It really helped her. Then I started tutoring her brothers,
words, friends, and my family on the free tutoring, as you mentioned, and before I know it,
10, 15 cousins, family, friends. And I've always been interested in education. So this wasn't a
complete fluke that I was doing this. I'd done tutoring and other times in my life. And I have
always, I had always dreamt of one day starting a school of some kind. So I was always interested by,
by the problem and I thought I could help my cousins. And I was always interested in the
intersection of, well, if you can solve a problem, can you use technology to help you scale any
solutions that you had. So that was always in the back of my mind a bit. But in 2005,
with that in mind, I did start to make some practice software for these cousins. That was
the first Khan Academy had no videos or anything like that. But it was just to help scale a solution
to a pattern I was seeing. A lot of my cousins just had gaps in their knowledge. They needed
more practice. I as their tutor wanted to make sure that they were getting that practice and I
wanted to monitor it. So that's, that's why I wrote that software. And once again, just as a hobby.
And then in 2006, a friend suggested that I help scale my lessons with videos. I thought it was,
I legitimately thought it was a silly thing to do. I thought it was very low tech. I thought
YouTube was kind of a place for, for entertainment, not a place for learning. But I gave that a shot
and my cousins famously told me they liked me better on YouTube than in person. And what they
were saying was they liked the pause, the repeat, always accessible, no embarrassment if they had
to review something from before. And so I kept going. And that was obviously very discoverable
by a lot of people as well. So I just kept working on that software and kept working on those,
those, those videos by 2008, 2009. That's where my brain was focusing most of the time. And so
my wife and I looked at our finances, we had some money saved up for a down payment on a house.
At this point, we had moved out to Northern California. But, you know, we felt like this,
there's something happening here. There was about 50 to 100,000 folks using the nascent Khan Academy
on a monthly basis. And there were some philanthropists that were, there were actually both venture
capitalists and philanthropists who are already signaling that they were interested. In fact,
the venture capitalists were, were more interested back then. But it felt important that this would
be a nonprofit organization, set it up mission free world class education for anyone anywhere.
And yeah, 2009, I, I took the plunge to try to get that philanthropic support to become a real
organization. It was a tough year to be very clear, probably the most stressful year of my life.
Our first child had been born and I'd given up a good career. But by 2010, we had our first real
support. And, you know, everything we've been doing since then has really been that same pattern.
How do we scale up that same personalization, that same student centered learning that you could
do when it was just myself working with Nadia. And, you know, most of our history has been
improving on the software, creating more and more content, exercises, videos, articles,
teacher tools, working with school districts. And obviously more recently, it's been leveraging
artificial intelligence on top of that. Right. So, so your new book, Brave New Words,
how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. It's a really interesting book
because on the one hand, your book is what the title says, how AI will revolutionize education.
And you, you talk about developments in AI, developments that you've contributed to AI,
you were, you were an early user tester and so on of all the versions of chat GPT.
But the, the book is also, it almost could be titled what everyone is afraid of in AI
and how we can solve each fear. And I noticed that is the flip side of AI. Like I was at a,
a dinner recently where there was a bunch of academics and journalists and scientists. It
was all in the science domain. And every single one of these scientists or writers of science
were really afraid of AI. They thought AI was dangerous. They, there was no positive things
said about AI, except when I pointed this out to all of them. Why do you think so many people
are afraid of AI? And then I want to hit how you address some of these things in the book.
I think AI is, it's interesting because it's especially,
it's especially threatening to folks who have always defined their identity by their ability
to write and speak and think original thoughts. So it's, it's not a coincidence that the
intelligentsia, so to speak, are the ones that are, are probably most of, most concerned about
this. And it's not to mean that these aren't, these aren't legitimate concerns or a lot of
them aren't legitimate concerns. But I think it is affecting folks with education, folks who, who,
who write, it gets awfully close to home in terms of identity. And so I think it, it immediately
puts people into a little bit of a defensive posture and a little bit of a fear-based posture.
And once again, I can't completely predict the future. We even saw that when we first got
access to the technology before the rest of the world did. And I would say half of our team was
really excited about it and want to go all in. And the other half had a lot of this trepidation and
to your point, you know, maybe your, your title of the book would have been a better one
because you're right. It really is this pattern that, you know, I, I probably have always tried
to lean in this way, but it's definitely accelerated with AI, which is, all right, we should write
down fears. One, one should not ignore fears and risks, but fears and risks are not reasons to,
to not try to move forward and make positive use of it. They are, they're things to address and,
and to deal with so that you can make, so that you can have a positive outcome.
Yeah. Like, I mean, obviously the very first thing that comes up when you talk about AI and
education and I have, all my kids are basically college age or graduate school age. The first
thing that comes up is cheating. And, you know, like, and I'll give a just transparent,
you know, experience. One daughter was in the final stages of her finals on the year
and she had like one day to write an essay and she hadn't even read the text she was supposed
to be writing the essay about. And I said, look, there's this thing called chat G P T just cheat
and get it done and graduate, just do it. And I don't know if she followed my advice or not,
but that was my advice because I want, for me, it was more important for her to graduate than
for her to learn this one thing, but that is a big concern of, of teachers and parents and,
and everything. Cause a lot of people don't care about their education or, or they don't think
that their college or high school or whatever is giving them a good education. So they're
willing to use it to cheat. Yeah. It's, it's a real thing. And you know, what I write about in
the book is I always like to start from first principles, like, okay, you know, what was the
state of things even before chat G P T came onto the scene. And it didn't take long to realize that
cheating was already pretty rampant. And if anything, there does seem to have been a cultural shift,
even since you or I were in college, in terms of probably more acceptance of cheating than ever
before, you know, and once again, before AI existed, probably the internet, software tools,
their services that are happy to write essays for you or do other types of problem sets for you,
their quasi legitimate publicly traded companies that will help you do your homework and, and help is,
I'm saying it very euphemistically, they'll essentially do your homework for you. So this
existed well before. And so I think the question is in this world, what are we hoping to get out
of students when they do these types of tasks? And if, if part of it is to make sure that it is
their work. And in the book, I talk about, look, there's certain cases where you probably want
students to use the tools. In fact, these tools are going to be part of their future. But there are
certain cases where you definitely want to make sure that it's the students own work, how you can,
how you can address it. And you know, the AI actually isn't, it can be part of the problem,
obviously with things like chat, GBT, but in a lot of ways, I'm optimistic that it can be,
it can be a very big part of the solution that addresses not just AI cheating, but cheating
in general, where students won't have the work done by the AI, but the AI can be their coach,
an ethical tutor, ethical writing coach. And then it can make transparent the process to the teacher.
So the teacher doesn't just get the essay, they get the whole transcript of how the student worked
on it and the AI's analysis that it's similar to the student's other writing or that they worked
on it for four hours or they had trouble with the thesis statement initially, but eventually got there
and be able to give the teacher insights across the whole classroom that, look, 15 of your kids
are having trouble with thesis statements. Here's a lesson plan that you might want to go on, go and do.
So I'm optimistic on that front.

I have to say Airbnb has changed my life. I just love staying in Airbnb's. Like in about a month,
I'm going to Cocoa Beach, which is right next to Cape Canaveral. I'm going to watch some rocket
launches. I'm going to, of course, be staying in a very nice Airbnb on the beach. And it's just
such a great experience. Like the whole world is available to us now because of Airbnb. But whenever
I'm at an Airbnb, I always realize, you know, the home that I left to come to this Airbnb,
I could be making money on that right now by hosting and being an Airbnb myself.
So, and I've known people, I had a friend who basically made a living from turning his home
into an Airbnb. So if you have a home, but you're not always at home, you do have an Airbnb there.
And it can easily fit into your lifestyle. And it's a great way to earn some money.
Your home might be worth more than you think. Find out how much at Airbnb.com slash host.
The famous Abraham Lincoln quote says, good things come to those who wait. I wonder,
did he really say it? Jay, did he really say that? Can you look that up? Regardless of who said
that's only part of the quote. The full quote is good things come to those who wait,
but only the things left by those who hustle. Well, if you're a business owner and want the best
people on your team, the same applies. And listen, I've interviewed 1500 people now and a lot of
entrepreneurs. I can safely say the one thing consistent among all entrepreneurs and CEOs,
the successful ones, is that it's all about the people you surround yourself. If you hire well,
you're going to have a great business. And, you know, thankfully zip recruiter puts the hustle
in your hiring. So you find qualified candidates fast. This is so important. And I want you to
try it. You could try it as a potential employer or employee. You could try it for free at zip

away immediately after you post your job. If you're hiring zip recruiters matching technology
starts showing you qualified people for it. And I will tell you that I signed up on zip recruiter
as a potential employee. You know, I just wanted to see how it works. And right away,
it started matching me with really amazing potential employers. So give it a try at zip
recruiter.com slash James, let's zip recruiter give you the hiring hustle you need. See why four
out of five employers who post in zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day.
Just go to zip recruit.com slash James to try it for free. Again, that's zip recruit.com slash
James zip recruiter the smartest way to hire. Right. So and this isn't in general like a theme
that runs throughout is that viewing AI or or or chat GPT like programs as a collaborator
or a partner rather than as a secret weapon is kind of the basic solution to all of these fears.
So so for instance, teaching doesn't go away. But hey, if just like with the kind of kind of
people were able to watch the video. So now the T and learn basic math lessons. So now the teachers
can focus on more more discussions and interesting topics in the classroom itself. So so for instance,
if you if the teacher knows the student is using chat GPT to answer questions about the great Gatsby,
that might actually be a benefit to the educational experience.
Yes and no, I think that the key is that everyone is going into it with eyes wide open that the
teachers and the educators know why they're asking students to do things. They're very clear about
certain tasks where it will be pedagogically valuable to use the chat GPT's of the world
and other things where you don't want to use them. But I want to be very clear about use. There is the
use of, say, a general AI platform like chat GPT that would be, you know, that it could be used to
do very productive things like do research, help understand a concept. But those also could be used
to write your essay for you or do things that a lot of educators would find, hey, that's probably
undermining what what I was trying to get out of this. There's other use cases of generative AI.
And this is where Conmigo, which right now is built primarily on GPT four, but it's a different
application than chat GPT. But that's built explicitly to support students and teachers
in a in an education framework. So it won't cheat, but it will socratically work with the students.
The bottom line is I think we're entering this phase where educators have to be more explicit
about why they're giving certain tasks and also explicit on the types of tools that are acceptable
and aren't, probably with some light oversight, potentially AI empowered oversight of what the
students are doing. And it's going to be more and more on the students also to be very clear
of like, hey, this is not something that I should do, and this is something I should do,
but also know that they're going to be held accountable by it, that there are that Conmigo,
what we're doing at Khan Academy, there are tools now to monitor what the student is doing, make sure
it is their own work, when the teacher wants to make sure that it's the student's own work.
Although it seems like every time there's an attempt to, oh, this is definitely created by AI,
humans are smarter in this sense. They're always going to develop ways to override
whatever tools are being used to detect AI usage and homework.
Anyone who tells you that they have some type of an algorithm or watermarking technology or
statistical algorithm, whatever it might be that can detect AI generated work is either
significantly exaggerating or lying to you. There have been plagiarism detectors, but for
the most part what AI is generating is novel, is novel text. So it's very hard to detect.
Now the way that some teachers have detected it, just with their spider senses, they have seen
work that just seems different than what the student has turned in before, or it just seems
surprisingly cogent, or maybe a little bit bland compared to what typical people would write.
Now even those cases is usually because the student didn't use the AI artfully enough,
that if they really tweaked it a little bit, tweaked their prompts, maybe adapted some of
what the AI was writing to make it a little bit more personal, it would have been very hard to
detect. So our strategy here isn't to try to magically just read a paper and say this was
written by an AI or human or 50-50 or some other percentage in between, it's to make
the process transparent to the educator. So we aren't, with Conmigo, we aren't saying,
oh, we ran some algorithm and there's an 80% chance this is AI written. Instead, we tell the
teacher, here's the transcript of the student working with our AI, working with Conmigo on
their essay. It took them four hours, here's the conversation, here's a synopsis of the
conversation, they had trouble with the thesis statement, we worked on outlining in this way,
etc., maybe a comparison to previous writing that it seems similar. So it's not trying to
just detect based only on the output, it's more of giving a very strong indication based on
making the entire process transparent. If the student goes to chat GPT or gets their sister to
write the paper and it just shows up inside of Conmigo, Conmigo is going to tell the teacher,
hey, this just showed up, we didn't work on this, you should look into it. And by the way,
it's very different than what the student has written before. I think that's the kind of lens
that we need to really, not only police cheating, but I don't want to make this just about policing
and making it punitive. I also think this is how we're going to better support students and teachers
because the students are going to be much more supported as they write and the teacher is going
to get many more insights about where the students' strengths and weaknesses are in their writing.
Yeah, so in that sense, the transparency that, hey, I'm using an AI tool and here's the final
output. Part of the final output is the essay I came up with, part of the final output is
Conmigo's, like your AI tool, Conmigo's analysis of our sessions together.
That's right.
I think that's very valuable. I think this idea of AI as collaborator is an important
reframing of the role of AI in our lives where, just like we have a calculator now to do math
equations, oh, I have kind of an intelligence assistant to help me with problems so I could
really focus on the bigger problems. That's right. What we've been doing when we do professional
development with teachers is we tell them, look, imagine if all of a sudden your school district
discovered a few billion dollars and they want to use that money to hire three or four super
hardworking teaching assistants for you that will help you do lesson plans, help you grade papers,
help you write progress reports. They'll also analyze what your students are doing on a regular
basis to let you know. By the way, they're also going to be able to tutor the students.
They're available 24-7. These are amazing teaching assistants and they'll be able to
connect what you're doing in class to where the students need help and vice versa.
Every teacher on the planet would say, yes, sign me up for that. I truly believe that's
where it's going. This isn't about replacing teachers. Now, one thing we've always said at
Khan Academy, our ideal is let's raise the ceiling when a student does have access to a reasonably
good classroom and educators, but there are cases where students don't have access to a classroom.
It could be a developing nation. There's no school at all. It could be even in the U.S.
you're a rural part of the world or a country where there's not a calculus class within an hour
hour's drive. Then we want Khan Academy and Khan Mego by extension to help raise the floor
so that you can get more supports when there aren't any others.
You talk about teachers being worried about they're going to be replaced by AI. I think
this is happening in a lot of professions right now and that's part of this. There's this existential
fear that we're all horse and buggy drivers and we're not going to need it anymore once the cars
are around. Whether it's writers, teachers, other professionals and so on, but maybe we don't need
teachers. Maybe AI and Khan Academy with Khan Mego can do the job. What is the role of teaching
right now? I'm not saying what I'm about to say just because it's the right thing to say.
It's what I genuinely believe. I wouldn't be saying it otherwise. I would just stay quiet if it
wasn't what I generally believe. I think any role that is about the human connection, about the human
motivation is going to be not only in very good shape in an AI world, but those are going to be
the roles, the jobs, the careers that are most enhanced in an AI world. Even though historically
many people associated teaching with, oh, I'm going to write a lesson plan, then I'm going to
deliver this lecture, then we're going to have a quiz every two weeks, and then I'm going to grade
those quizzes, and then we're going to rinse and repeat for two weeks. Any great teacher will tell
you that's actually not their job. What's actually their job is on a very human level to connect with
their students, either individually and small groups as a whole class to motivate them to see
the wonder in the world, to make sure that these students feel seen and supported, and on top of
that, the teachers have to grade papers, write lesson plans, progress reports, IEPs, prepare them
for standardized tests, and because we're asking so much of teachers and some of that latter half
of stuff is more tangible and more measurable, it's actually squeezed out a lot of teachers'
opportunities to do those very human things. I think anyone who goes into the teaching profession,
they dream of these moments where they're able to have some time in a small group with some
students or give that one student who was really down and out of pep talk, and it changes their
life forever, and it will change their life forever. I think in my 12 years, 13 years in the K-12
system, I remember probably every moment when a teacher did single me out out of the 30 kids and
say, hey, Sal, can I talk to you about something? I really liked what you did, or I really didn't
like what you did. It affected me. It changed who I am, and I think that's what, or a teacher
ran a Socratic conversation with 10 of us as opposed to all 30 at the same time, or we had a
field trip, or we ran a simulation, and those are the things that I don't think the AI is going
to be able to drive, but I think the AI will be able to support it, but once again, freeing up the
teacher to do more of that. The jobs that I think will be under threat with AI, or there will be
fewer of them, are the ones that you are, you know, if great writers should not feel threatened,
but if you're the person who writes the fairly generic text every day on the news sites about
why the stock market went up or down, I'm surprised if those aren't already written by AIs.
If you- I think a lot of them actually are. They feel like it. They feel like they've been
written by AIs for 10 years. I think if you are, you know, if I'm dealing with the education system,
the registrar's office, I think, is going to be, you're going to see a lot of automation there,
but once again, as just a citizen of the world, I think the more resources that we can save on
the non-student-facing thing and put it onto the student-facing thing, that's a good thing.
If you look at school districts like New York City, they spend an average of $40,000 per student
per year. There are 25 students in an average classroom in the New York City Department of
Education, so that means if you just took $40,000 and multiplied it by those 25 students,
that means that there's a million dollars. I guarantee you that no matter how good the
teacher's benefits, pensions, etc., they're getting a small fraction of that million dollars.
Maybe a very senior teacher with a great pension, etc., maybe with great health insurance,
maybe it's $150,000. If you put all the benefits in there, you know, approaching $200,000, that's
very- I think I'm already being overly, you know, no one's really making that much. So,
where are all the other resources going? It's actually not going to the real estate in most cases.
Where is it going? And it's going to all of this, let's call it back office, administrative
stuff that really isn't moving the dial with students. And actually, I don't write too much
about that aspect of it. That's probably less interesting for a lot of folks. But yeah,
register's office, scheduling, you know, just a lot of the administrative things,
I think will hopefully get much more streamlined.
You know, what about the current education system is an antique at this point? I mean,
I feel like the current, roughly the current education system's been around for 200 or so years,
that you go to a school, you go to a location where there's a bunch of subjects taught throughout
the day. So, every day it's like six different subjects. You go from class to class to class,
and you get homework. At the end, you get tested. So, that's roughly the structure of the modern
education system. And what part of that you think is outdated now?
Yeah. And, you know, my first book that I had written back in 2012, One World Schoolhouse,
it kind of goes into how did we end up with the system? And it really does, it's not a coincidence
when you say it's, you know, roughly 200, 250 years old, it came out of the industrial revolution.
And for the most part, it was a very utopian idea. For most of human history,
we learned through apprenticeship, we learned through, you know, following around, learning
from our cousins or our parents how to hunt or how to cook. We, you know, once society became more
advanced and more specialized, we would, yeah, we would hang out with the blacksmith or we would
hang out with the, you know, I don't know, the carriage repair guy or whatever it would be to
learn or, you know, even things like law and medicine was an apprenticeship until
about 200, 250 years ago. But the issue with a lot of these is that they didn't scale.
If you go back 300 years ago, very, even in more literate parts of the world, you only had a 30
or 40% literacy rates. Most of the world, you only had about a 10 or 15% literacy rate.
And so, when we had the industrial revolution, we had a more abundant society because of technology
and a lot of these societies, and it's not a coincidence that these were some of the first
societies to develop a middle class, the UK, what would eventually become Germany, Japan,
the United States, they were the first to say, hey, let's have a mass public education system.
Very utopian idea. But they said the only way we can afford to do that, the only way we can scale it
is by leveraging the techniques of the industrial revolution. We're going to bat students together,
usually by age, move them together to set process, literally a bell will ring every hour. I mean,
that directly comes from a factory. We're going to have standards. We now take standards for
granted in education, but this was a thing that came out of mass production in a factory. We will
assess periodically. But we're not going to slow down that assembly line. Instead, we're going to
assess and some of the, quote, product is going to be said, okay, this is the product that's going
to be the doctor's lawyers, engineers, and some of it, well, the information or the knowledge
doesn't seem to be sticking. Well, these will be the less skilled laborers. So it kind of worked.
We could talk about, was it fair for folks? You could have been, and people have been talking
about the inequities of tracking for decades. When you're 12, something's not sticking, and all
of a sudden you're tracked into a slower track, and now all of a sudden, no one expects you to go
to college, and people expect you to be a lower skilled laborer versus becoming a doctor or lawyer.
Is that fair? That's a very big question. I don't think it is. But it kind of worked for society
in that we didn't need a huge number of people in the knowledge economy. And we did need a lot
of people who are in either the middle income or lower income jobs, a lot of the mid skilled
or lower skilled labor. We did need it. But if you imagine the world that we are going into,
we know it's going to happen to the less skilled jobs, or even the mid skilled jobs. Obviously,
we're talking about artificial intelligence, which is all about kind of that mid skill
processing of information. Everyone I talk to robotics is not far behind. I think a lot of
folks are saying in the next five or 10 years, we're going to have a chat GPT type moment with
robotics as well. So that also means that some of the lower mid skilled labor is also going to
be automated, probably in the next 10 or 20 years. And so where does that leave us? Well,
it leaves the high skilled labor, the knowledge economy, being a researcher, being an engineer,
being an entrepreneur, is where all of the productivity, all of the wealth will accrue
there. And so as a society, we have to decide, are we okay with only right now 10% of people
participate there? And then that's not a stable society, or we're going to have to do redistribution,
which to me is still pretty dystopian, because people want to have a sense of purpose.
Or do we leverage the technologies that we have to get as many people as possible into the top
of that pyramid to be in the knowledge economy? Instead of having a labor pyramid, you can have
an inverted pyramid where most people are able to be in that knowledge economy. And so I think
that's where the imperative is. So how do you start making those changes in the educational
system? And also, I think there's some question as to whether people effectively learn by taking
six different subjects in a day. Like multitasking learning has been shown to be not the most
effective way to learn. And you even mentioned this in the book, that the more one-on-one,
more immersion is probably better for education. Yeah. The core ideas, and this is something
I've been preaching well before artificial intelligence came on the scene, is instead
of a traditional model, what we hold fixed is how long you get to work on something,
because that assembly line keeps moving. And what's variable is how well you learn it. And we get
that in the form of grades. You and I take a class together, we're in algebra for this term,
you got an A minus, I got a C plus. All right, it goes in my permanent transcript and we move on,
somehow expecting me that I got to, expecting someone who got the C plus to now understand
algebra two or understand something more advanced. And so what I've all, I've been advocating for
the last 10 years or more is let's do it the other way around. What should be, what we should,
what should be variable is when and how long you work on something and what's fixed is how well
you learn it. And that's what a personal tutor, when Aristotle was Alexander the Great's tutor,
I'm sure that's what he did. If young Alexander hadn't mastered a concept yet, he would have slowed
down a bit or, you know, given him a second chance to take that test to make sure that he really
mastered whatever military strategy or, you know, governance, whatever, whatever was the,
whatever was the topic for the day. Now, if I said this, say 30 years ago, people would have
rolled their eyes or say, well, okay, it's easy for you to say, but unless you have a lot of resources
to, to provide that level of personalization, there's no way you can, you can have 30 different
students learning at 30 different paces. And if one student is falling a little bit behind for,
for them to have a second chance to take that test, that's just logistically impossible to do.
Now, what's changed over the last 30 years, even before artificial intelligence is you have tools
like Khan Academy, you have software that can let every student practice at their own time and pace,
give teachers real-time information. If a student needs to refresh their knowledge on something,
they could watch an on-demand video, they could read an article, now they can have a conversation
with a artificially intelligent tutor. And once again, that tutor is also in contact with the
teacher. So constantly guiding the teacher on how they can be a conductor of this class of 30,
where they don't have to make every person play the same thing at the same time, regardless of how
bad the quality or how, how, how, how not ready for it they are. Now you can, you can, you can
personalize a lot more. And so, and a corollary to that is, you know, I talk about mastery learning,
which is, if you haven't learned it well yet, keep trying. And once again, this is how we've,
we've always instilled do, if you want to be an Olympic athlete, if you want to be a musician,
you are doing mastery learning. We just don't do it in our school system. And you see the outcome
differences between how good people can get as if they have a personal coach. But, but a corollary
to mastery learning is what I would call competency-based learning. Right now, our entire credentialing
system is based on seat time, for the most part. Did you sit in a chair for 12 years
and kind of do what you were told, even though you don't really understand a lot of it? Okay,
we'll give you something called a high school diploma. Did you sit in a chair for 12 hours
this week for a term? Okay, we'll give you the 12 credit hours or however they want to account
for it for that course. And you kind of learned it. We know in reality, very few people actually
retain most of what they quote are exposed to in school. 60, 70% of kids going to community
colleges are gay, have to get remediation, not even at a high school level, essentially at a
seventh grade level. So they sat in these classes called algebra one, algebra two, trigonometry,
some of them even take calculus. And the colleges are saying, you're not even ready to learn algebra
yet, go back, we're going to work on your pre algebra. So a corollary to personalization
and mastery learning is moving to a competency-based credentialing system. If you know it,
take some type of a rich assessment and we'll give you credit, even if it only took you two days
to learn it. But if you haven't learned it yet, that's cool too. Here are some resources to keep
learning. Come back in a month, come back in two months, come back in a year, and I'll give you a
second chance to actually learn the material.

So now let's bring in AI. How would you use AI to who would decide? Would it be the student or
the teacher or both or the AI? Who would decide like, oh, James needs a little more work on his
algebra too as opposed to Sal who got an A plus on every test? Who would decide how much more time
do I need and what would I be assigned to do? Like would the AI give me tests or teach me or
like what would happen? It's a little bit of all of the above where even before we had artificial
intelligence, we have these classrooms where students are working on Khan Academy and we were
able to give signals to teachers as to which students are moving ahead and we want to encourage them
to do so, which students are on track and which students are maybe falling behind. But we did
leave it all, you know, we did professional development for teachers on how they might want
to navigate that. Hey, for the kids who are ready to move ahead, let them move ahead for the kids
who are behind, why don't you do a focused intervention with those six or seven kids?
And a lot of teachers were doing that type of thing, but you can imagine it can get pretty
complex and pretty hard even if you have some of these software tools. What we're able to do now
with the artificial intelligence is it really is acting like a data analyst and or teaching assistant
for these teachers. So set up a teacher every night having to look at a spreadsheet like dashboard
and say, okay, these are the kids who are struggling. Let me break them out or let me
do another lesson plan, which is a lot of work for the teacher. They can just ask the AI what's
going on. And the AI says, look, here's what's going on. These are the kids on track here. You
know, if we do a differentiated lesson plan tomorrow, I recommend these kids work on this task
while you spend the first 20 minutes with these students. And the teacher's in charge. This thing
is in support of the teacher. The teacher is going to be able to say, no, I don't really like that
activity. Can you and we already have this where they can highlight parts of it and they can say,
let's come up with something that's a little bit more fun or a little bit more engaging or gets
the kids out of their chair. And the AI will say, yes, sir, yes, ma'am, and do that. But as you can
imagine, it dramatically lowers the amount of analysis and prep time that a teacher has to spend
in order to create these really engaging and differentiated personalized education experiences.
It's also going to all these other trappings of school that as students we never saw, as parents
we oftentimes don't see, writing progress reports, grading papers, IEPs, which are these
plans you have to write for students who need special supports, which are increasingly a larger
and larger percentage of the student population takes a lot of the teacher's time. Teachers have
to prep their own knowledge. If the AI can dramatically improve that time, we've been getting
signals from school districts that Conmigo is helping the teachers with their, with this
non-student facing work, it's saving them five, 10 hours a week. And so you're going to see it
there. There's this phenomenon called learning management systems, which are increasingly the
ways that teachers and students communicate with each other and make assignments and submit
assignments. And right now, these are web-based things. I see more and more the AI acts as that
intermediary where it's working with the teacher on the planning, on the creation. It provisions
it to the student. It works with the students on those things. And then it's able to report back
to the teacher. So, you know, we can, and I can daydream more and more. You can imagine a world
where an AI can start to even know what's going on in a classroom and support even more. But even
before we go into those more sci-fi use cases, it, I think it's just going to be a, it's just going
to be in the fabric of everything that the teacher and the students do. And hopefully in a way that
supports the students and the teachers better and streamlines things.
Do you think it will happen? Like, let's say, you know, AI is moving pretty fast. And already,
there are tools like Conmingo. Just, you know, what is it like a year and a half after the first
chat CPT was released? What, where do you see education five years from now? Like in K through
12. And then I'll ask about other types of education. Yeah. You know, I think there's certain trends
that are going to happen that are not fully technologically related. And there's going to
be things that are going to be AI related. The non technologically related, I hope we do move,
as I mentioned earlier, to a competency based system, less seat time, that we can go more to
a mastery based system. And that starts to involve a little bit more technology, because
if you, if you're asking a teacher to say, Hey, if a student got to see the first time,
they should have another chance at that assessment. Well, who's going to write that assessment?
That's work. Who's going to grade that assessment? That's work. And so that I think that's where
the technology plays into it. In terms of how the technology is going to manifest itself,
for sure, all of that support work that we used to bury teachers with, I think is going to be
dramatically streamlined. Once again, lesson planning, writing exit tickets, grading papers,
teachers always in charge. But I mean, imagine being a seventh grade English teacher and every two
weeks, you literally have to sit there and read 100, 150 papers about great expectations
from seventh graders. I could imagine by the third or fourth paper, it can get a little bit
tedious. Instead, you had a reliable AI that can give analysis, you can spot check it,
you're the final arbiter, but it could take that, you know, that thing that was ruining your weekend
to a task that might take an hour instead of 10. So you're going to see that, you're going to see
the AIs get better and better at supporting the students, not just conceptually, not just academically,
but I think from an executive functioning, from a metacognitive, so one project we're working on,
we call it Proactive Conmigo. It doesn't just act as a Socratic tutor, it's going to start
messaging students. Where are you? The things I used to do at Nadia back in the day.
Hey, you said you were going to hit these goals by Friday, it's Saturday now and you're only halfway,
come on, what's going on? It's going to be able to facilitate a lot more communication between
the teacher, the student and the parent, where when it finds that, hey, there's something off,
parent, you should know about this. And hey, teacher, by the way, I already told the parent
that this is happening. I think you're going to see more of that. I think the whole area of assessment
is going to be really, really interesting. A lot of the criticism of education over the last 20
or 30 years is we've tried to measure more things, which for the most part is a good thing, and we've
been trying to measure it in standardized ways, which for the most part is a good thing. But because
so many people started indexing on these things that you can measure in a standardized way,
they maybe have lost sight on other things. I was talking to a senior administrator at Harvard,
and he was telling me that even at Harvard, they're seeing almost an epidemic of kids who can't write.
And if Harvard's seeing that, I can guarantee you it's 10 times worse pretty much everywhere else.
And it's probably, you know, no one knows exactly why. Well, think about what standardized testing
has been for the last 20 years. There's no writing in it because writing has fundamentally been hard
to assess or to be able to give someone standardized, clear feedback on. And so it's kind of maybe
started to disappear in many cases. We see in the other things in math, when people focus on a
multiple choice assessment only, multiple choice can have value. There's nothing inherently wrong
with multiple choice, but it might squeeze out other things if we put too much emphasis on it.
And so I think AI with its ability to make sense of more open-ended responses and even visual
responses or even video responses, I think it's going to broaden the aperture of how we assess
and how we even assess in a standardized way. And that's going to be good because it's going to allow
school to going back to less, you know, let's not just focus on what can be assessed
or narrowly assessed, but what's important. And now we can hopefully assess that in a broader way.
So do you think is this hopeful or do you think this actually will happen in the educational system?
We're working on it. So I'm both. It's, you know, there's definitely a possibility that
a lot of folks, well-intentioned folks have good ideas and either they don't get traction in a
system that historically has sometimes been slow to move, or it manifests itself in unproductive
ways. You know, that's one of my fears. That's why I tell our team at Khan Academy why our role
is important. We're not for profit. We are focused on how does this actually drive impact?
There are other players, there may be more sales focused, and they're just happy to make the sale
however it gets used. And that might not lead to the best possible outcomes for teachers and students.
But generally speaking, I'm, you know, obviously I'm, I plan on devoting my life to this, so I
wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think that this was going to happen.
And so, you know, you mentioned earlier that a lot of times students don't retain what they
learn. I think this is really true. It's, it's what you learn in history class in ninth grade.
I would say there's probably a 1% chance you remember it now, unless it's something that
particularly fascinates you. What do you think will change in the system that will increase
retention? I think if we, if we are more explicit about moving to a competency-based system,
where we say, look, well, one competency-based system makes you, makes you get, have to get
more clear about what you care about. Like, what are we really going, and look, some of the things
that we learned in ninth grade that we forgot, that might be okay because it was less about learning
the text of, I don't even, you know, I don't remember even the eighth amendment, you know,
the text of the eighth amendment, but it was more about learning to critically analyze things,
etc., and that might hopefully be a skill that has, that we have retained. But there probably is
content knowledge that we do want. In fact, there for sure is content knowledge that we want people
to retain, but we, we need to get just more explicit about that. And then if we get more
explicit about, look, everyone who graduates from high school should, for the rest of their life,
be able to solve a simple equation. They should for sure know who Alexander the Great was.
They should for sure know how to make sense of a informational text written at at least maybe a
seventh or eighth grade level, which is what most texts in, in, in, in our life are actually written
at. And then if we can focus on those things, because competency-based learning also focuses
you, because right now there's a lot of just hoop jumping and seat time and this or that that could
be very idiosyncratic to a particular classroom. It allows you to focus on those things and make
sure those things happen. And then hopefully streamlines from some of the other busy work that,
that doesn't have to happen as much. But do you ever see a point where, okay, this student's
really good at math? Oh, he spent one week learning algebra one, that was all he was focused on. So
now he's able to move on to algebra two, and he goes at his pace and another student goes, actually
goes at a slower pace. And so you do have for a classroom of 30 students, you do have people
going at 30 different paces, you know, and, and they're immersed. So, so that increases
retention. There's less multitasking from going from biology to history to fit to math or whatever.
So some of that's already happening. We, after I wrote my last book, we, and my, my oldest at
the time was entering kindergarten, we started a school con lab school that implements a lot of
these. And I won't claim that we figured it all out. In fact, I'm always pushing the school to,
to be thinking a little bit more about questioning a lot of the assumptions. But you know, at,
at that school, yeah, you do have a good number of students. And math is probably where we're
seeing it the most, where they could easily be three, four, five, six grade levels ahead.
There's a lot of students who are probably, you know, at or one or two grade levels ahead.
And there's a few who, you know, the faculty is working extra hard to make sure that they're
going at least at a reasonable pace, that they're going to get at least get to calculus before they
leave high school, which in the broader world is already a win, because most kids don't even get
there. So we're already, we're already seeing that type of reality. But I think we need to see
more experiments. I would, you just mentioned of like being able to focus on certain things at a
time. I'm intrigued with that idea. There's universities like Colorado College, or colleges,
I should say, that do do that. You, you take classes, instead of taking four or five classes,
you take one at a time, but you do it for two weeks. And that's all you do. And then you go and
switch and you do another one. I think that's interesting. And I don't think it's just going
to be the con lab schools and the, the Colorado colleges of the world. We have partnerships
with very mainstream school districts, Newark, New Jersey, we're seeing some really good things.
And they're doing a bit of a hybrid where the teachers are using Khan Academy to assign the
daily practice. And by the way, the kids have support from Khan Mego. But the district says,
Hey, look, if you finish your assignment and you did it well and you got, you showed your
proficiency, you can keep going. But if you did the assignment, but you only got 30% of it right,
you should have another go at it. And now it's going to be different items because it's,
it's sampling from a very deep item bank, or maybe you're not ready for that assignment,
because you're missing some prerequisite skills. How do we get you to, to get some more practice
on that without falling too far behind? This is happening in Newark, New Jersey, as we speak.
It's interesting. And in 1982, I was part of this program where these seventh graders would take the
SATs. And if you did well, you were invited to participate in this program at Duke University
called TIP, where it had this immersion experiment. And I always remember finally, like in three weeks,
I was able to go through like a couple of years of math. And, and then when I got back to regular
school, so I was in a summer program. And when I got to back to regular school, I was able to
advance more quickly. And I always thought that was an incredible experiment that they were doing.
And then at the time there was only 22 students in the program. Now there's like tens of thousands
across various campuses. And I just wonder when kind of the mainstream educational system is going
to start adapting this, but it sounds like it is to some extent, it is. And you know, if you, if you
look at communities where I live, I live in the middle of Silicon Valley, what you're describing
is, is more the norm than the exception. But yeah, and I think the work is how do we make that accessible
and the norm more broadly. And that's why most of our work at Khan Academy, most of the places
where we are deploying Khan Migo are large-scale public school districts. But we're seeing
more traction than I would have guessed a couple of years ago.
Now in terms of the, the existential threat for various industries, one area that has been
a big concern, and you mentioned this quite a bit, a bit is the ability to write. Like
this has been a big debate in education. Like you mentioned at Harvard,
some students don't even have the ability to write. And then in the, in the creative industry,
like screenwriting, I think there is a real question. Will, will AI, will the, the GPT-7 be
able to write an Oscar-winning movie? And I think the conclusion in general, and your conclusion
is that it won't be, but it'll be a useful tool again for the creative to be even more creative.
But I think people are very worried about this. And I will tell you just from conversations I've
had with heads of major movie studios, they are looking for solutions other than screenwriters.
Yeah. Well, I think there's a bunch in this. So on the first level, let's, let's take a, you know,
most writing essentially has two pieces to it. There is the putting words on paper in a structured,
hopefully engaging way, grammatical way. And then there's the, how do you come up with what
you're going to write? So if you're a journalist, I would think most of your work
should be going out there talking to people, looking through public documents, you know,
attending public hearings, being on the same scene of the crime to report what's going on. So,
so that's all the work that I don't think AI is going to be able to do anytime soon.
And then the journalist takes all of that, and then they write the article, you know, and all of
that. And so I think AI there very clearly has a role of, well, if it can help this, the journalists,
let's say take all of their notes that they just got from multiple resources,
sources, maybe different recordings, maybe even videos, and then help them get to a first draft
pretty fast, maybe with a little bit of prompting. I think that's a win for that journalist.
They're going to be able to spend more time on the information gathering and less time on
the wordsmithing. But once again, I don't think it's that you're just going to take all that
input and let the AI just pop something out that, okay, let's put in the New York Times. No,
the journalist is then going to tweak it and say, no, that they're going to act more like an editor.
And they're going to say, no, that let, we're burying the lead, let's put this quote up front,
et cetera, et cetera, let's tighten it, let's make it a little bit more punchy. So there's
still going to be work and the craft of writing and the ability to recognize good writing is
still going to matter. I think if we go to the movie industry, I'm not sure exactly how this
is going to play out, but, and I write about this in the book, I think what is going to happen is
AI is going to lower, like I found it ironic that it was the screenwriters who are afraid of AI,
that the production companies really want it. I actually think the AI is going to bring the
balance of power to the individual, to the screenwriters and take it away from the gatekeepers
who are the production houses. We already saw that before AI with things like YouTube and social
media. I mean, you're even seeing this with mainstream news now. It's essentially been
disrupted already by YouTube and social media. The ability for someone to publish and be discovered
without having to go through gatekeepers now is completely transformed. Justin Bieber was a
YouTube artifact. I'm a YouTube artifact. People can publish podcasts now. You don't have to make
a pitch to some executive at wherever to do that anymore. That's the way the world was 30 years
ago, 40 years ago. With AI, I think you're going to see a similar, you're lowering the cost of
getting into the game. Today, if I want to, if I have a great idea for a science fiction movie,
and I have a few, I dream about one day, not only would I have to write a screenplay,
I would have to get it in front of people who take me seriously. Even if I wrote a great screenplay,
I might not even be noticed unless I'm connected in the right ways, unless I get the right people
to read my screenplay. Then someone will say, oh, it's a pretty good screenplay. I'll pay a
couple hundred grand for it if it's really good. In most cases, I'll pay a couple of tens of grand
for it. Go write another one while you're living off of ramen. Then that movie studio might throw
some of them away, but eventually say, okay, we're going to put $100 million behind this one,
hire actors, director, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, five, 10 years later, the movie comes out.
If it's a blockbuster, the movie studio is going to make hundreds of millions of dollars that the
screenplay writer probably made less than that, a lot less, a lot less. If they're very savvy,
they might have gotten a little bit of a cut of that movie, but in most cases, they're getting
next to nothing. In the world we're going into, if I have a great sense of story, if I know what
a great movie should look like, I don't have to stop at the screenplay. I will be able to produce
the entire movie probably for tens of thousands of dollars or less, including editing sound.
I'm not going to have to pay actors. I would worry if I'm an actor, actually,
in this world, but the creative who's at the core of the idea is going to be able to go much,
much further, and then they're going to be able to self-publish it on YouTube and monetize it on
YouTube, or maybe there'll be paths, maybe there'll be a YouTube slash Netflix-like thing where
slightly vetted people can surface and put their content out. I would be much more worried if I was
the production houses. The production houses probably are going to invest in it. They're going
to figure out ways to do editing much cheaper. They are going to be able to write screenplays,
but a commodity screenplay is very different than a great screenplay. I think for society,
it's going to be good because think about how many hundred million dollar duds there are,
how many bad movies, frankly, most hundred million dollar movies are bad. What a waste
of society's resources. Now, we're going to have a bunch more of movies that probably
cost ten or a hundred thousand dollars to make, and they're going to have a higher percentage of
bad ones because it's going to be like YouTube, but we're also going to have a higher total quality
of good ones. It's interesting because Tyler Perry, for instance, he shut down plans to
build a hundred million dollar studio space because he says AI is going to do this. He's a big
movie creator. He has the same view as you. I think I agree, but it's interesting to see how
nervous the writers are. Maybe it's just like an insecurity of writers because they haven't been
historically making that money. They've been kept down in the system, so they just assume
they're going to be kept down again, but you're right. It is going to give them power, but it's
interesting. From your book, there's various groups of people that have these fears. There's
creatives have these fears. There are teachers that have this existential fear. There's professors
who worried the students are cheating. An interesting chapter is the one on parenting. Do you see
parents being afraid AI could take their place? I don't think any parents, well, hopefully parents
aren't afraid of AI taking their job as a parent. I think most of the fears of a parent are we see
directly our kids getting addicted to devices. We either see directly in our own families or
schools, or we read about how things like social media and cell phones are affecting mental health
of especially young people, teenagers, probably disproportionately young girls. That's scary
to parents. When we see a new technology that's as powerful as AI, is this going to make everything
worse? Not really having a clear idea of how it will make it worse. My hope once again is I actually
think used well, I'm sure there's going to be use cases of AI that are not great, that can almost
amplify a lot of the bad things that we already see on the internet, whether it's marketing to you,
whether it's forms of social media that make you feel insecure, or you have permanent fear of missing
out or whatever is going on, or hurt your body image, whatever. But I think there's going to be
use cases, these are the ones we're going to focus on, hopefully others focus on it as well,
where the AI beyond just helping you academically, it can help you even handle the world that you're
dealing with. I write in the book about the AI acting as a guardian angel. Right now, when you
surf the internet, and our children surf the internet, they don't realize it, but they're
already doing battle, and they don't even know they're in a battle with AI's, where these AI's
are figuring out the next thing to show on their social media feed, or the search results, or the
next ad, and their objective function is what's going to get you to click on that ad, or what's
going to make you watch longer. And unfortunately, it seems like triggering content, polarizing content,
content that makes you feel bad about yourself, is the stuff that makes you sit on it longer.
And you know, any of us who have fallen into it, we've all spent some time on the internet and
clicked on an ad, or spent more time on social media, and we never feel good about it when we're
done, right? We all feel like we kind of wait. Is that true? I feel like that's a little bit
of a cliche. Like, sometimes I surf the internet, and I like, I enjoy the experience.
For me, it's true. There's definitely times where my friend sends me a fun video,
or a meme, or I fall into it a little bit on YouTube, or on TikTok, and I get a good giggle,
and that was exactly what I needed that day. But more often than not, we have fully developed
frontal lobes, and we can regulate ourselves after 10 or 15 minutes of that. But you know,
I'll say even TikTok, which I've shut down my account, and I had a reason to be on it. We had
a social media following. I just took it off, because I found even myself, I just went to TikTok
to announce a new feature on Khan Academy, and then I end up just swiping and swiping,
and then 10, 15 minutes go by, and I'm like, I don't feel good about what I'm doing with my day,
and I stop. I was able to stop at 15 minutes. There's a lot of young people who aren't stopping
at all, and they're going two, three, four hours. And look, it's great if someone has the self-regulation
to be able to stop after 15, 20 minutes. That's probably healthy fun, as long as it's not making
them feel bad about themselves. But I'm imagining a world now, and we're working on this, where
an AI can act on your behalf, or act on your parents or your teacher's behalf, where, yeah,
okay, I'll let my daughter use a cell phone, but I want to see a world where there's an AI agent
on that phone that I am in conversation with, and I would tell them, like, look, I'm cool with her
spending some time on it, but you know, let's be careful about her seeing things that hurt her
body image, or things that make her feel like she's missing out on things, or just put her into
this polarizing haze, or whatever it might be. Then the AI can make sense of what she's surfing
and looking at, and say, hey, we've just spent the last 10 minutes looking at pictures of that
friend's birthday party, and when you were out of town, maybe we want to go do something else,
or if it can see patterns in what the daughter is doing, tell the parents, hey, did you know your
child's spending an awful lot of time doing X, Y, or Z? One, that might just be something to police
a little bit more, or it might be an opportunity to have a connection. Like, did you know that
they're really interested in crocheting? Maybe you should take it up. Maybe you should have a
conversation with them. This is something to talk about at the dinner table. So I'm hoping that the
AI can act much more as a used well, a little bit of a guardian angel, and it can help parents,
it can support parents, engage with their children more. I hope that, you know, right now we have
devices like Siri and Alexa and Google Home, and right now they're kind of like, you know, what time
is it? Put a timer on, you know, what's the weather today? You know, how many people live in
Ukraine? That's the type of things we use it for. I would love a time, which I think is going to
happen in the next year or two, where I'm, you know, sometimes we're having dinner together.
I want to, and we're having a conversation, but I know that there's more that my kids have going
on in their life, that I'm not getting out of them. When I just ask them, how is your day,
how was school, what's, you know, how is history class going? And I could imagine a world where
an AI says, I could say, hey, Alexa, can you moderate a conversation, a fun conversation
between us as kind of an icebreaker? And it does. And it says, all right, we're going to go around
and everyone's going to say the best part of their day. And then when my nine-year-old says,
oh, my best part of the day was getting to hang out with my, you know, my friend who was out sick,
then the AI could say, well, why was that? And, and, but once again, it's not squeezing out the
parent. It's creating a context to, as a parent, I crave more context where I can engage with my
children in a more meaningful way, as opposed to just being transactional, put that iPad away,
go to bed, eat your food. Hey, it's time to get up. Hey, we're late for the bus. You know, I don't,
we all have to do that as parents, but it squeezes out the like, what do you think is the meaning
of life? Or what does it mean to be a great friend? Or how can we all be better family members?
If, if we could have an expert facilitator all the time, that'd be pretty incredible.
Do you think, do you think, uh, are you going to get a wearable like AI, like this humane AI
pin or, or rabbit or, or maybe make Conmingo a wearable? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, um, I have no
imminent plans to do, to do that. Cause I'm also someone who really likes going off the grid, so
to speak, and being completely unplugged in certain cases. But, um, if, if there are devices that come
out that could, that I, that I can legitimately believe will enhance my life in some way, I'd,
I'd be open to it. And as long as they have the data privacy and, uh, all of the right safeguards in
place. Now I'm wondering what, one big question out there is, does AI somehow plateau? Like,
is there only so much it can learn and simulate, you know, human conversation? So you mentioned how
like GPT-5 is going to have a trillion parameters as opposed to GPT-4, which just had 175 billion,
as opposed to GPT-1, which had, I don't know, a million or whatever it was at a trillion parameters
or 10 trillion parameters. What can AI do that prior versions couldn't do?
None of us know for sure. And I think it is a philosophical debate about if an AI is trained
on human created content for the most part, can it transcend human intelligence in certain ways?
I think the answer is in certain ways it will be able to, because as these, as the parameters
increase, it'll be able to find, um, patterns that are not maybe explicitly obvious to us,
and maybe leverage those patterns to create things. Um, but will it be like, you know,
a truly transcendent intelligence? I don't know. I think one of the interesting
things that are going to happen is they're going to be collecting more and more inputs.
Right now it's pretty much human created, written text for the most part, and now images, videos,
sound, files. I think when the AIs are, get more sensory perception, you know, once you have
wearables, once they have cameras, I know this is a little bit dystopian, so, you know, we have to
think about how this gets provisioned. It's going to get more training data. Um, I also think robotics
is interesting because when we learn, we don't just observe our environment, we play with the
environment. I mean, we literally, that's what, that play is literally learning. A kid pokes
something, throws it, you know, shakes it, and figures out what, how they're investigating the
world. And I can imagine, um, once you pair AI with robotics, and then it can actively investigate
the world, it will get even more input on, on, and maybe even, and look, it's, it's going to be able
to have sensory input that we don't have. It will be able to see the entire electromagnetic
spectrum, not just the, that the, you know, it's going to be able to hear every, every frequency
of sound. It's going to be able to, um, you know, detect molecules that we can, we can't at least
consciously detect. Um, so it's an interesting philosophical debate, but I, you know, once you
start talking about orders of magnitude, more parameters than we have synapses in the human
brain. Um, and it's tireless and it has access to all of this information and it can process it
faster than we can. It is interesting. And I know everything I, even me talking out loud has, I've
kind of scared myself a bit, but, but, but, you know, once again, it's all about intent and how we
use it and, and, and, and can we use it for, for good purposes, uh, because there, there can be a
lot of good purposes here. I mean, it's just something that, let's say a good purpose is education,
I do, and there, there's, there's evidence that I think with a general AI that basically exceeds
our current educational efforts, kids are going to get smarter and meaning they're just going to
learn faster. They're going to retain more. They're going to, um, get that feedback loop much more
quickly and, and so they're going to be able to, to advance more quickly than our generation was
or the generations in between. I mean, an example that you can see in a specific domain, it's not
a general domain, but look, computers have been better than humans at chess since 1997 and, and
computers have evolved incredibly since then. So it's been, you know, over 20, you know, 25 years
or 20, whatever, 27 years of computers improving since they were already better than humans and,
and kids use computers to learn chess with some coaching, but 99% is they're playing the computer
and getting immediate feedback. And then there might be some coaching and kids are so much better now
than they were back in 1997 and their rate of improvement is so much faster. I mean, a 17 year
old, just the other day became the challenger to the world championship that never would have happened
25 years ago. So it's, it's incredible how in, in that specific domain and other domains like that
kids have advanced and learned and retained so much faster than kids back then. And I wonder if
the same thing's going to happen in, in general education. I obviously hope so. Um, and it seems
like it definitely will. Like our kids will be smarter. And I, you know, I, I, I typically traffic
in optimistic scenarios, but I, and so I hope what you're saying is right. There's a, there is a,
a more dystopian, I don't know if it's dystopian, but a less optimistic scenario where
you're going to have a segment of students who, who take these tools and run with it and
will do exactly what you said. They're going to, to, to get to heights that we never thought was
possible by, at very young ages. And look, that's, that by itself is not in any way a negative thing.
That is a positive thing. These are going to be the young people who cure diseases for us,
who start the next, you know, great, uh, companies who write the next great novel, who
produce the next great movies, uh, all of the above, uh, push AI forward or make sure that AI
is used in a safe way. But I do, I think it's how do we make sure that the other, whatever it is,
60, 70% of students stay engaged and engaged enough to not be, um, not be thrown behind by, by all of
this. Because if they are, it's not, it's not, uh, it's not good for them as human beings and it's
not good for society. And so that's where a lot of our, well, we're already seeing with Conmigo
in the classroom is there is a segment of student who just runs with it and they are off to the
races. And once again, no one should hold them back. I mean, sometimes the school system,
temptation is to hold those students back. That is not a good idea. We want these students to,
to move it as fast as they can. Um, but how do we make sure that everyone has a, has a decent
chance of, of being able to participate without holding people back is where a lot of our work is.
Well, and you know, you've been involved in, in obviously been involved in education for
almost 20 years. Con Academy has been around almost that long. Why do we have the old system?
No, why do we have credentialing at all where, oh, in order to get a job in a high profile
place, I need a degree from Harvard. Why can't I just go to Con Academy for a year or two,
learn what I need to learn and get a job at Goldman Sachs or Silicon Valley or Hollywood
or whatever. Like, like what is, what is the real role now of, of higher education? Why can't I just
use online education for that? I agree with you a hundred percent. And you're starting to see
aspects of that exist. You're definitely seeing that in, in fields like software engineering, where
you know, the same employers that 20 or 30 years ago might have said, okay, we're only going to hire
from MIT and Caltech and Stanford. They're now saying, Hey, anyone can take this boot camp or
take this assessment. And if you pass it, we're going to interview you the same as we would interview
a, you know, a 4.0 grad from Stanford. So that's already happening in, in certain fields.
I think what you're going to see, and this is a passion of mine, is I do want to create
competency based credentials that have the same or greater prestige as going to Harvard or going
to Oxford. So much so that even if you go to Oxford or Harvard, you'll still want to get these
things to show that you actually learned some, some very useful, very useful skills. So
you know, systems change is harder than technological change for a whole series of reasons. But this
is something that I, you know, and hopefully I have many decades left on this planet. But I'm
hoping in the next 10 or 20 years, hopefully closer to five or 10 years, you're going to hear
some things even from us about ways that you can get high school college credit, potentially even
job opportunities via a pretty streamlined route. Once again, that doesn't mean that it's an either
or you might want to do both. But if you don't have access to Harvard, which very, you know,
I was telling some very senior people at Harvard that right now there's this false
tension where they feel, you know, everyone writes about admissions and it feels like a
false tension between equity and merit, where there's like, oh, affirmative action that gets
ruled down by the Supreme Court. So how are we going to make sure we have equity and that we
have right, you know, good representation, if we have to go more based purely on test scores or
whatever else. And what I've told them is like, you know, it's a false tension because what you've
hold, what you've held constant is capacity. Like you're, you're, you only, you only admit
whatever 2000 students every year, even though there's probably 100,000 qualified students every
year. If you could, if you could serve all of the 100,000 qualified students, you wouldn't have to
have these weird, bizarre discussions about admissions and equity and all of this that
people are having. You would just be able to, if you're, if you can handle the work, we are
admitting you and you will get a credential that can get, that can open up the world to you.
So yes, I hope that we can, we can create some pathways like that.
I think the part of that tension is, is the scarcity principle, which is that
Harvard prices their scarcity. And so they make money from their scarcity. You and Khan Academy,
or let's say a commercial equivalent makes money from scalability as opposed to scarcity.
And Harvard doesn't want to have a hundred thousand students. They want to accept only 2000
because that loud, they could charge 300,000 a semester and they'd still fill up. And
you know, I think, I think that's the tension really.
Yeah. And, you know, and obviously our motivation is, you know, our costs go up as we scale. So
our motivation is more of just like, well, how do we maximize impact? But you're right about,
there's always going to be a notion of scarcity and the reality of the Harvard's of the world.
And so much of the education debate focuses on, let's call it about 30 universities,
even though it's less than 1% of students go to those 30 universities. But those 30 universities
are relevant because they, they do over influence society. And so I think there are,
it's not going to go away anytime soon that there's a certain, you know,
the U.S. doesn't have a caste system in the traditional sense, but our elite institutions
are the best proxy for them where, oh, oh, you're Harvard class of whatever,
wherever were you there? Oh, did you have this professor? Oh, wow. Like we're part of the same,
part of the same club. I don't think that's going to go away. What I, and I think there's other
positives of not just Harvard or Stanford, but college in general of being there in person,
forming bonds. I met my wife and many of my best friends in college and we have our best
memories there. So I think we can always optimize for some of those in-person experiences,
but I want to create also alternative pathways. So that's not the only way that you can get into
an upper middle class or, you know, promising career. On that optimistic note, and I really hope
you're right, I've been writing about this also for a long time. And I'm really looking forward
to the utopian world that you have been outlining and creating and explaining particularly in your
book. I'm going to say the title again, because I always forget things really quickly. Brave new
words, how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. And I think what you've
explained today has solved a lot of the, also the fears that many people have about AI. But
Salman Khan, creator of the Khan Academy, thanks once again for coming on the show.
