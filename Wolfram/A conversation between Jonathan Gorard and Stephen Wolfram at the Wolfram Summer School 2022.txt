Our event for the evening is a chat between myself and Jonathan, which might have the
subtitle of I'm Trying to Understand What Jonathan's Been Up to for the past several
months, which can sometimes be challenging.
But I think what I really like to do is talk about some of the things that I know Jonathan's
been working on, and maybe my kind of mundane questions will help illuminate some of these
things for everybody.
So if I understand correctly, you know, people talk about categorifying things.
And could we say that you are the part of what you're doing is categorifying a multi-computation?
Would that be a reasonable thing to say, or is that way off base?
No, I think that's a pretty reasonable way to phrase it.
I mean, in a sense, one of the reasons I wanted to have this conversation, or I thought it
would be useful to have this conversation, is I kind of feel as though both of us in
slightly different ways are trying to kind of investigate, you know, the abstract science
of multi-computation and its various applications.
And you know, people often say that sort of category theory is like a mathematical language
for processes and how processes compose.
But you know, in the modern world, the standard way that processes get represented is as computations.
I think in many ways it's more fruitful to just think of it as being a mathematical
formalism for computations and how they compose.
And in a sense, you know, ordinary category theory where you just have sequential composition
is like, I think, is basically akin to classical theory of computation.
Monoidal category theory where you can do composition both sequentially and in parallel,
I view as being like the kind of categorification, as you put it, of multi-computation and multi-way
systems.
But yeah, and to a great extent, what I'm trying to do right now is make that connection
a bit more concrete, develop the formalism a bit further, and see how some of the areas
in which we've been attempting to apply multi-computation so far, like in physics or in chemistry or,
you know, to foundations of mathematics, how those can be potentially informed by this
connection to compositionality.
I'm excited.
Okay.
So let's go and do a similar research.
So first of all, for everybody's benefit, let's just start off by talking about what
is category theory, what's the, maybe everybody knows that.
Does everybody, does everybody think they know that here, or some Yorick is saying yes,
but that's not, that doesn't count.
I've talked about nothing else for the last couple of weeks.
Oh, it's not, it's not lecture, right.
Well, for my benefit, perhaps, can you, can you say what you think, what do you think at
this point?
Now that you've studied category theory and the nodal category theory and so on, what
is the essential idea of category theory?
Okay.
So in a sense, the, the, okay, the way I like to think about it is that this, you know,
the set theoretic picture of mathematics involves, you know, you can ask the question, what is,
what is a mathematical structure, right?
You give me some group, what is that group?
You give me a topological space.
What is that topological space?
The set theoretic perspective says, well, we just break it up into pieces.
We look at, you know, for a topological space.
We look at its point set or for a group, we look at its group elements and we get some
notion of identity of that structure from, you know, breaking it up into pieces.
Category theory, I think, is a more relational, more process theoretic, ultimately more computational
way of answering the same question that you say, no, instead you, you, you don't want
to, you know, you don't want to look inside the object, right?
You don't want to break the group up.
You don't want to break the topological space up into points or into elements.
What you do is you say, well, what gives this structure, its identity is how it relates
to all other structures of the same kind.
So, you know, what, so if you want to identify a particular group, another way, another way
you could answer that question, you know, what is that group is you can just say, what
other groups does it have homomorphisms to?
What other groups is isomorphic to?
How does it relate to all other groups in the category of groups?
And that's effectively the, oh, similarly with topological spaces.
What other spaces, instead of talking about points and point sets and topologies and
open sets and things, you could just say, well, what other topological spaces can this
be continuously deformed into?
What other spaces can be continuously deformed into this space?
And if you give essentially, you know, the collection of all continuous functions to
all other topological spaces of the same kind, the remarkable feature about compositionality
is it's an equivalent answer to that question, right?
The same information you get by breaking the topological space up into pieces is, you know,
is, is also captured by the information about how it can be, you know, continuously deformed
into other spaces.
So let's, let's take that apart for a second.
So let's take a simple example, actually, let's take an unreasonable example.
Let's talk about Turing machines.
What is the, what is the category theory view of Turing machines?
Um, well, okay, so Turing, so one, one thing that's definitely, one, one very interesting
general feature of category theory is that, and this is really, I mean, more concretized
in Topos theory, but, you know, we can just stay at ordinary category theory for now.
Um, that there's, that it makes this kind of, there's this duality or more precisely
what's called an adjunction between sort of between syntax and semantics, effectively
between.
So for, if you give me a formal model of computation, uh, and the, you know, generally people talk
about this in terms of type theory, but there's no particular reason to talk about it.
It's just that, that happens to be the approach that was adopted.
But if you give me some formal model of computation, I can construct a category, which is really
just a multi-way system that encodes the syntax of that computation, right?
So, you know, for the case of a Turing machine, I can construct some multi-way system where,
you know, every, every, every state vertex is a, is a Turing machine state, you know,
a state of a tape and a state of a head and every evolution edge is some, you know, is
the application of some Turing machine rule.
And obviously those, those different threads of Turing machine evolution can compose sequentially
and they can compose in parallel.
And that's what gives you kind of the structure of the multi-way evolution graph.
Um, but there's also a kind of semantic view of what's going on, which is that you can
talk about this, you know, in the case of Turing machines, you could talk about the partial
functions that that Turing machine is computing and how they relate to it.
You know, you can effectively, you can imagine instead a semantics on the category of sets
and set valued functions.
And then there's this, there's this very nice relationship where you can define a pair
of functors that take you from the kind of syntactical category to the semantic category
and back again.
Um, and let me try to, you know, I'm sorry, my simple way of thinking about this, okay,
so in a multi-way system, we have the nodes of the multi-way system are states of Turing
machines.
And then there are in some rule, you know, multi-way system, there are multiple possible
rules that can be applied from every state of the Turing machine to make new states
of the Turing machine.
Right.
So we have this time evolution of Turing machines going in this multi-threaded time evolution
of Turing machines.
So that's our standard sort of multi-way story.
Right.
Now you say there's a dual picture, which is consider the functions that Turing machines
compute.
Right.
So we have to define a little bit what we mean by what functions a Turing machine computes
because that's imagining, you know, we've got in this original view of multi-way systems,
we've got a particular state of the Turing machine as well as to a particular state of
the Turing machine.
Right.
How do we get to, so a function, it means you've got a whole range of possible initial conditions
for the Turing machine mapping to a certain range of possible final conditions.
Right.
Right.
So we've got a bunch of different dots in the multi-way graph and we've got that kind
of, you know, how they flow through to a bunch of other dots in the multi-way graph.
Right.
So is that the right way to think about it?
Yes.
Yeah, absolutely.
And so in a sense, okay, I mean, we're skipping maybe a head a little bit, but that duality
between syntax and semantics has a very concrete realization in the context of multi-way systems
because effectively the semantics is given by branch of graphs and mappings between branch
of graphs.
And so maybe Turing machines is a bit of a, is a less nice example to get your head around.
I mean, so the example I might give that's a bit less sort of mind bending would be something
like groups.
Right.
So you can build a multi-way system, you know, multi-operator system or something that encodes
the axioms of group theory.
Right.
And so you just start from some seed and in principle, every proposition that's true about,
you know, in universal algebra about group theory will exist as some state vertex in that
multi-way system.
But you could.
You say that very quickly, but I think it's a little bit more, I mean, there's more to
say that, right?
Because, because you're saying, well, let's not give up on the Turing machines for a second.
Okay.
Because you're, you know, what you're saying is there's this notion, which I like very
much of this, you know, the function computed by the Turing machines is this mapping of
this whole collection of possible states, which could be a particular slice captured
by a branch of graph mapping to another whole slice captured by a branch of graph.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.
And that the branch of graph to branch of graph mapping you identify as being the function
defined by the Turing machine as opposed to the kind of, you know, the individual path
followed, which is the actual, you know, the execution of the Turing machine.
Right.
Right.
And so this is so actually the syntax semantics duality is deeply related to this sort of
vibration, foliation duality.
Right.
So, but I'm not wild about this notion of this term syntax versus semantics because I've
spent so much of my life in conversation of languages, you know, as semantics as a whole
bag of other issues, but, but, but in the case of, so what you're saying is we can think
of this collection of this multi-way collection of Turing machines as being in terms of every
threat of evolution, we can also think about it by saying, you take all the possible states
of the Turing machines at a particular post time, and we look at the mapping of that whole
collection of things onto some future state.
Okay.
So actually, I mean, so just on that point, so I agree in some ways, the, you know, using
the terminology syntax and semantics may be unnecessarily obscure or something, but how
would you, I mean, so it does seem to me that there is an inherent distinction between,
you know, you've got some bare metal multi-way system that's just producing a bunch of states.
There's then some interpretational or encoding step where you say, and this computes such
and such a function, and how, so how would you, just terminologically, how would you
distinguish the bare metal multi-way system from the kind of interpreted one?
Well, when you say interpreted here, we've got this whole giant branch of God, which
is something that, you know, in our view of the observer is something where the observer
has to be the thing that's knitted together this whole collection of different, as you're
putting it, you know, bare metal computations.
And I suppose the, that concept of an observer to observer, you know, observer state to observer
state transformation, I mean, for me, that's sort of a new concept, I mean, you know, in
the sense that I'm not sure that I would associate that with, you know, when I think, okay, let's
talk about syntax versus semantics as it's described in languages.
Okay.
I mean, so the syntax of English is, you know, how do you put the words together?
The semantics is, what is the, what is the quotes in a meaning of that piece of English?
Right.
The problem is people have always had a hard time understanding what an earth in a meaning
actually is.
We finally have, you know, language and the whole computational language idea, we now
have a sort of, for me, I see that as a concretization of what inner meaning actually is, right?
I don't really quite get what, okay, there are many syntaxes, many ways I can say a sentence,
which map to the same inner meaning, right?
And, you know, presumably, and, you know, somewhat obscurely, there can be a sentence that can
be, have a particular syntax that can be interpreted with many different inner meanings, right?
Which is semantic ambiguity, yeah, which is, you know, depends on who you are and what,
where it's said, all this kind of thing.
Even seeing things as mundane as how the sentence is parenthesized or whatever, right?
I mean, yeah.
If you say, you know, I'm doing this, or I'm, you know, I'm doing this and your voice
goes up at the end, and it's kind of, it's a question for me.
Right, right.
It's neither injective nor subjective.
Yes.
So these are, these are two separate, and I don't quite see the analogy between kind
of, kind of the, the syntactic level is an easier to define structural level, the semantic
level is this thing that's operating above that, that I've always found very hard to
define.
I mean, in a sense, that's actually why I brought up the example with groups, because
I think that, so in, in generally in foundations of mathematics, I'd say the distinction between
syntax and semantics is slightly better to find because you have this distinction between
proof theory and model theory, which is quite, you know, quite a hard distinction.
So the, I know that we disagree on this.
I mean, the fact is what, one of the questions is, what is mathematics actually about, right?
And, you know, Hilbert famously said, it might be about tables and chairs.
It doesn't really matter.
It's just a formal system where you set up the rules for the formal system and then
you, you know, prove things from it.
Whereas other people, like, I guess, who was Poincare, for example, was very much, no,
it's not just about tables and chairs.
It's about things we actually imagine are somehow real in some platonic sense.
Or famously, I mean, that actually influenced Goethele's research, right?
I mean, he thought showing, for instance, that there existed models that were consistent
with, with the continuum hypothesis was equivalent to showing it was true, which is only really
acceptable if you're a Platonist.
Well, Goethele was very much a Platonist.
I mean, Goethele as I know.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I mean, I've only learned quite recently, you know, that the usual picture of kind of
the Goethele operation was, you know, there was, there was Hilbert who was trying to define
this model where, you know, mathematics would all become mechanical.
You just had to set up the axioms.
And then as, as Poincare described it critically, he said, you know, you're turning mathematics
into a thing like this machine I've heard about in Chicago, where, where things going
up one end and, and what was it, hot dog?
Yeah, sausages.
Yeah.
And that, you know, mathematics is then turned into just this machine where you mechanically
go from the, from the underlying axioms to everything that might be true.
And that was kind of the view of mathematics in the first few decades of the 20th century.
And then, you know, the, the, the usual picture is Goethele came along and said that can't
be right because there are these undecidable propositions, these things that can't be established
to find out proofs from by the machine when the machine would never, would never actually
produce the sausage.
And the, the, but I think what I, what I recently learned is that, you know, the picture was
Goethele was operating within this framework of this very mechanical view of mathematics.
But actually Goethele, you know, he has this one footnote where he says, well, this might
be true that there are these undeterminable, you know, propositions of things.
This might be true, but for brains, for human minds, things might work differently.
And I think what I've only learned recently, maybe other people knew this all along, is
that Goethele really had a very platonic view of mathematics that there really is an underlying
to mathematics, and that all of this stuff with Hilbert's, you know, axiomatic framework
and formalism and so on, was merely an attempt to kind of provide a sort of a sort of a set
of mechanical accesses to that, but there was something different and fundamentally different
underneath.
And so he thought that by showing that this sort of formalistic wrapper was going to blow
itself up, that that would establish that there really was something underneath that
simple type sets.
So I have a couple of comments on that.
I mean, one is, so there's a version of that argument, which is, I mean, it attributes
it to Goethele, but which is kind of made a little bit more, maybe a little bit phrased
a bit more eloquently in some of Roger Penrose's writings, where he also defends the Platonist
position, but essentially using a modification of that Goetheleian argument, which is that
both, as far as I can tell, both Goethele and Penrose have the same kind of philosophical
interpretation of Goethele's second incompleteness there in the statement that you can't prove
the consistency of piano arithmetic from within piano arithmetic itself.
So essentially a version of the argument, okay, there's a lazy version and there's a
slightly more sophisticated version, the lazy version of the argument is, oh, but we can
see, clearly we can see that arithmetic is consistent, and therefore we must be doing
some process that's not captured by this formal specification of the machine that's doing
the proving. A more interesting version of that argument is you say, well, one of the
things that theorem tells you is that, in effect, there's now this whole infinite hierarchy
of arithmetics, because if you have some, if you have piano arithmetic, you can always
construct a stronger system, which is piano arithmetic plus the axiom that piano arithmetic
is consistent, or that axiom system plus the axiom that that system is consistent and so
on. And so the argument goes, well, for any attempt you make to kind of form it, to box
mathematics in, to formalize it in some in some finitary deterministic way, there's always
some way that it's going to be able to break out of it again, which again is kind of viewed
as a defense of the platonic view. I mean, I know you are aware of this, and I know we've
discussed this in some detail, maybe it's worth saying just in case it kind of wasn't clear
to other people, that one of the things that comes out of, well, NKS, and I'd say more
recently from the physics project, I mean, you have notes in the foundations of mathematics
section of the, whatever the principle of computational equivalence chapter of NKS, this
effect. But, you know, this distinction between, you know, the sort of girdle view of Platonism,
the Hilbert view of formalism, the sort of Russell whitehead view of logicism, etc. But
those distinctions kind of evaporate when you start to think about, well, science and
mathematics in more explicitly computational terms, in no small part because, you know, if
you take something like the Wolfram model, right, it's in its most abstract form, it's
just a collection of rewriting operations on, you know, hypergraphs or collections of
elements. And those elements have no intrinsic meaning, they're just purely symbolic, right?
And I realize you have this kind of term Ems to kind of sort of refer to this in, yeah,
in the more, in the more.
It's now being captured in a fine science fiction novel that somebody is writing.
Right.
So it's, so it's real.
Right. But so, if, you know, if that is a good model for, for science and for physics,
one is confronted with the, with the realization, you know, so Hilbert may famously defended
this formalist position by saying that, you know, mathematics is nothing more than this,
this meaningless game played with meaningless symbols on bits of paper. But if we now have
to confront the possibility that, you know, our universe is a meaningless game played
with meaningless symbols on what presumably not bits of paper, but on, on some as yet
undefined substrates, then you're forced into this rather awkward philosophical position
of either you have to afford physical and mathematical objects the same degree of ontological,
you know, substance, or you have to kind of argue that this is a, this is the wrong way
to view, you know, the structure of reality.
And so, so, you know, in a sense, it, it, when taken to its logical conclusion, I'd
argue, and I suspect you'd argue too, that is, you know, it really means that formalism,
that Hilbert's version of formalism also implies a version of Platonism.
I suppose you could say that. I mean, my, my argument would be kind of forced to a position
where if we say we exist, we also have to say mathematics exists.
Right. Or physical objects exist or, you know, whatever.
Right. Yes.
Either, either, yeah, either nothing exists or mathematics has to exist.
Right. I have to fundamentally exist as a, as a, as a sort of a thing that you can kind
of, it's not something where you're just defining it formally. It's, it's a, it's an inevitable
existing thing, so to speak. But I think we, we, we, we kind of,
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
Yeah. The point I was going to make in really, you, you were, you were disagreeing with my
statement that the distinction between proof theory and model theory is, is, is, is rigid.
Whether, whether we can have an, you know, in our imagination, whether the integers are a real
thing, whether the integers are merely a, maybe you should go on with your.
Well, all I was going to say was that, you know, so you can imagine, take this back to
something more concrete and computational, you could imagine having two different kinds
of multi-way system, right? You can imagine having multi-way systems that are effectively
multi-way operator systems based on the group axioms. And you could also have imagined having
a multi-way system where every state vertex is a group and every evolution edges is say a
homomorphism. And that would be so in the, yeah, in the, in the sort of, in this adjunctive
relationship in category theory between type theory and models for type theory, you would
call the first thing, the syntactical category in the second thing, the categorical semantics.
And the interesting thing is that you can generate one from the other, right? So there's a,
there's a, there's a pair of left and right adjoint functions that take you from, I mean,
again, the standard way you describe it is that you've got, you've got a category that represents
a type theory in which every object is a, is essentially a type environment and every morphism
is a kind of, you know, a replacement of, as a substitution, as a replacement of variables.
And then you've also got this other category, which is like the actual semantic thing where,
where, you know, the objects are groups and the morphisms are homomorphisms or something.
And you can, and there's, yeah, there's a, there's a sort of procedure that will freely
generate, say, the semantic category from the syntactical one, and you get this thing called
a walking model. And so there's, it's a fairly, I mean, it's, there's a lot more that needs to be
kind of concretized, but it's a fairly well developed sort of idea. Yeah. This is interesting.
And okay, so, you know, on one picture here is you've got a multi-way system where every node
is a whole group. Yeah. And every edge is something that, that connects that group to a
group to which it is homomorphic. Yeah. Okay. That's thing number one. That's your sort of
semantic level version. Now you've got a level where the individual elements are what are, are,
how are you constructing your syntactic level thing? What are, what are the pieces of the
multi-way system in that case? Well, so for the case of an, so this is an algebraic, you know,
group theory is an algebraic theory, which kind of what it means to be an algebraic theory is that
you just, you have some binary operation and you have equation rules. So probably, right, right.
But, but you should, but generally words that are quantified, right? They're not, they're not
specific words in some model of a group. They are universal algebraic statements.
And so when you say statements, okay, just, just by clarification, right? So, you know,
groups, you can, you can, I mean, this is something in that metamathematics piece I, I did,
you know, was something that held it up for a year and a half was, was the, the sort of
messy correspondence between a theorem being something which is this word, this set of symbols,
is equivalent to this other set of symbols versus a theorem which says this set of symbols is
equivalent to this set of symbols and deriving another equivalence from that first equivalence.
Right. Those two things are not fundamentally different. One is just applying rules to,
to elements and the other is applying rules to rules effectively. Right. They're not fundamentally
different, but I, I'm just to clarify, maybe it doesn't matter. But this is why I brought up the
thing about algebraic theory. So I, so in an algebraic theory, I would argue the most natural
representations have every state, every state vertex be an equation and have every evolution
edge be an application of some, you know, some equation or a one way application of some
of the equation or rule. Whereas in more general non algebraic theories, it makes more sense to
have each, have each state vertex be a proposition and then have the evolution edges effectively
be one way implications. Fine. But what you're saying is you've got an equation that says a dot
b equals b dot a dot a or something. Right. And then you have a transformation which turns that
equation, which potentially is another equation applied to that equation, which when you substitute
one equation into the other, and you get the result, you know, b dot b equals a dot a or something.
Right. Right. And that's okay. So we've got, we've got this notion. So in the token event
graph formalism, for example, we will be saying that these tokens are equations and that the
typical sort of rule of evolution, the law of inference, rule of inference is two
equational tokens, equation tokens, kind of mixed together. And one is substituted into the other
and you get a new equation out. Right. Is that the kind of picture that that term? Right. Right.
Something like that. Okay, fine. And so then in effect, what you're that sort of syntactical
multi, I mean, again, we may want to go over proof theoretic multiway system is essentially
defining it's, as with as any multiway evolution graph is, it's defining some partial order on
the state vertices. And that partial order is essentially telling you what you can, what you
can deduce from what, right? You've got, you know, if, if a proceeds b, then it means you can derive
b from a. It's a little bit more complicated in this case, where you're applying, you know,
whether two equations coming in, they get mixed together and make one equation out,
because things are going to do reverse and these equations get reversible and so on.
Right. But that's why that's, you know, in effect, your state equivalence function has to
like take into account these things like paramodulation, but, you know, that deal with
things like rule orientation. Well, right. I mean, what you're saying there is, when you take
one equation and you apply it to another equation, there are a bunch of weird little pieces of knitting
that you can do as you apply one equation to the other. And that, you know, substitution by
substitution, you know, co substitution, paramodulation, which is, I think, I think it's
the same as by substitution, but I'm not sure. The, you know, these are all just complicated
things about which variable is replaced and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But, but okay,
but we've got something where we have theorems effectively in the system that are derived from
other theorems. Right. Right. And you've got some path of theorem derivations. And that's,
that's view number one. And you're saying view number two is you take a, you're taking a thing
that's formed from a collection of theorems so that for which a group is a thing for which a
bunch of theorems are true. But okay, crucially though, a specific group, I mean, what distinguishes
doing group theory in relation to a particular group from just doing universal algebra, right,
and just proving statements about groups in general. Well, the, the, the key difference is
that for a concrete, for a specific instance of a concrete group, there will be additional
theorems that are true about that group, which are not true for the, in the universal algebraic
case. So effectively what you're doing, one way you can think about it is that you're taking this
partial order that your syntax multi ways is your, your proof theoretic multi-way system
defines and you're, you're making it more like a total order, right? You're, you're introducing
new orderings between states that were not true in the existing multi-way system. So,
another thing you could say is of all of those relations which were there, only some subset
of them are now considered true for this group. So you're taking a slice out of this whole
complicated network of, of, of theorems. There's some bag of those theorems that's true for the group.
Well, no, but every theorem that's true about in universal algebra is obviously going to be true
for any specific group. So it's more that it's not that you're removing some theorems, it's that
you're, you're effectively introducing new ones. Right. There are additional theorems which are
true. Right. You're saying and those. And so it's, so the, and so the, you can make the analogy to
relativity when, you know, you've got the conformal structure or the causal structure of space time
that is kind of a universal thing. And then individual observers impose new, you know, so
a particular observer can introduce new causal, you know, new chronological relationships
between space like separated events. Well, in particular, they can choose. This is something
that, right, right. Which is to say, and the point is that in the degenerate case, as you,
as you approach the speed of light in the relativity case, your partial, your space
time partial order becomes a total order, right? That's the sort of, that's the, that's the degenerate
case. So one way you can think about boosts is that it's a way of taking this partial order
and making it more like a total order. Let's walk through the total order. So you're saying
that normally you have a bunch of events happening in space time, right? And if you are, the claim
is, if you're a photon, you, there is only a, if you're, let's walk through this. So, so, you know,
normally there are things that happen in different places in the universe. And you get to define
whether, you know, what counts as simultaneity, what was, you know, noon on Earth, noon on Mars,
when were these things relative to each other? Right. Now, I think you're claiming that if you're
a photon, you don't get to do that. Well, photons have no notion of space, right? That's, that's,
that's the basic point. Well, all time. Right. So, you know, so as, you know, what does it mean
to say that you're undergoing a time dilation or length contraction? What it means is that
effectively your anti chains are getting shorter and your chains are getting longer. And if you
take that process to its, to its conclusion, eventually everything is just a chain. So the,
so the maximum boost is the case where your space time becomes totally orbit.
Let's, okay. So your claim is when you're using up all your computation on, on kind of
ongoing as fast as possible, you, you don't get to move at all in space is the basic plan.
Something like that. Yeah. You, you, everything is still not quite internalizing that, but, but,
okay. But, but so, all right. So now you're going to tell us what the animal is that math,
math, math. Well, so as I say, I mean, just abstractly, all that you're doing is you're
taking a partial order and you know, by, by, by foliating it by constructing these equivalence
classes, you're just introducing new, you know, new relations that didn't exist before,
which is what happens when you define a model in, in, in a, in a mathematical theory. So one
way that you could think about a model is that it's taking this proof theoretical,
this proof theoretic multi-way system and it's foliating it in such a way that you introduce
these new, these new, these new relations that didn't exist, that exist only as a consequence
of the model you've chosen. Yes. Okay. And so, and that's essentially the branch of graph story,
right? That's, that's now you're viewing the multi-way system in terms of its,
in terms of its branchial decomposition for some reference frame. And so that leads to this rather
interesting realization that essentially this duality that exists in, in category theory between,
I know you don't like syntax and semantics, but you know, proof, proof theory, model theory or
whatever, the syntactical category in the, in its, in its, in its sort of compositional semantics,
that's really just a special case of this duality between looking at a multi-way system in terms of
its multi-way evolution graph and looking at it in terms of its decomposition in the branchial
graphs, right? We know that they encode essentially the same information, except the branchial graph
also has this additional thing about, you know, its observer dependent. And that's really the,
and that's, that's what model theory is about. And then, for instance, something like the first
incompleteness theorem just becomes a statement that, you know, one way you could phrase, you
can phrase the first incompleteness theorem is that, you know, in any formal system that's
sufficient to encode piano, it's sufficiently strong that it can encode piano arithmetic,
there will be propositions that are true in some models and false in others. And so, that becomes
essentially a statement that, you know, if you make, again, going back to the relativity analogy,
that's equivalent to the state, or analogous to the statement that there can exist space-like
separated events where, you know, A proceeds, B in one reference frame, B proceeds, A in a different
one. So, effectively, the first incompleteness theorem becomes a statement of gauge, essentially
a statement of gauge freedom, which is- Although the other piece to that has to be something about
how they're infinite-length paths, so how does the infinite-length path story and the non-finance
approves, how does that come into that version of thinking about things, that there exist different
models? Why is it the case that- I mean, it must be something about how you can always find a
different model, which has the stiffened ordering, and that must be related to the fact that there
are infinite potential proof paths. Right, I mean, so in a sense, if there's an infinite proof path
between two propositions, or two state vertices, then for any finite size of multi-way system that
you compute, they're going to be treated as unrelated by the order. And so, yeah, eventually,
if you could take some infinite limit of the multi-way system, they would no longer form an
anti-chain. But the point is that for any finite length of computation, you still have that gauge
freedom to choose one to proceed the other in any way you like. Well, you're saying that you might be
another way to say this is, you think you've got a valid model, but actually, if you were to go long
enough in the multi-way graph, your model would blow up because the thing wouldn't actually be
consistent anymore, that you could take that as an anti-chain. Right, no, it wouldn't actually be
an anti-chain. It wouldn't actually, for people who don't know this, it wouldn't go, anti-chains just
means you have a partially ordered set. Things, you know, you're saying something precedes something,
there's a chain, which goes, you know, A precedes, B precedes, C, and so on. An anti-chain is just
the transversal of that, where you're saying what doesn't have a particular ordering that it needs
to, what doesn't have its ordering defined? What can be sort of at the same time as something else?
Maybe there's a clearer way to say that. That was a bit of an upskirt. It's basically the
transversal to a chain. You know, a chain is what has to precede what, and an anti-chain is what
doesn't have its ordering defined for it. Right, right. It's the stuff you have freedom to choose,
you know, the precedence relation for. Right, okay, so let's come back to this group's thing.
So you're saying you've got, well, maybe the general point, that is that, you know, you can look at
branchial evolution, or you can look at the underlying essentially temporal evolution. I mean,
in a sense, it's the spatial slices evolving to spatial slices, or it's the individual sort of
threads of time evolving. Right. And which you are going to interpret as foliation versus
vibrations in, you know, all sorts of systems. Right, right. Which is quite lovely. But again,
you're about to say the interpretation of the speed of light, of the infinite boost
in mathematics. I know you've had a, you've had a version of this for a while. What's the,
if we imagine in mathematics, we've got, you know, these different models that we can take,
and they correspond to these different, different foliations. And then we've got this extreme model
where, you know, where you've tipped things to the point where there are no anti-chains. Right.
So, so it's, it's formally the opposite of, you know, a free structure, right? So in,
ordinarily in mathematics, you would say, if you, if you talk about, say, a free group or a
free ring or a free whatever, what you mean is, you know, this structure contains no additional
relations beyond just what is imposed by the axioms of the theory. So that's the analog of,
like, you know, of the rest frame. Right. You just, you know, there are no additional
relations beyond just what the syntax of the theory implies. The infinite boost case, which,
for which I'm not, I don't want to claim it doesn't exist. I'm not aware of any standard
terminology for this in mathematics. It's kind of the maximally restricted version of the structure.
It's, it's, it's far away from being a free structure as you can get. It's introducing all
possible, you know, obviously there, there are, there's not just, there isn't a unique maximally
restricted structure, right? Because there are many different directions in which you can apply
your boosts, so to speak. So is it something for which all theorems are true?
Uh, I mean, a free one is something for which there are few theorems. No theorems are true beyond
the, you know, beyond what's implied by the axioms of group theory.
So, so maybe this, this extreme case is sort of all possible theorems are true.
Except, well, except it can't be all possible theorems, right? I mean, it would still be consistent.
You'd still want it to be a consistent theory.
Yes, but it's still the case that you're adding an infinite collection of relations.
Right, right.
I think you're, I'm just asking, can you briefly explain why that is well defined?
Why the, the sort of...
The opposite, so your infinite proofs, objects, whatever you call it, why is that well defined?
No, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not claiming that it's well defined.
Okay, yeah, but yeah, in fact, that's what, that's the point I was making about, you know,
just like with boosts, there are, you know, infinitely many directions you can apply your boosted.
It's just, yeah, effectively you're somehow maximizing, you know, it's some sort of optimization
problem where you're maximizing the number of theorems that are true about this particular
structure. And I, yeah, I don't think that's...
Let's nail that down a little bit more carefully.
This seems interesting.
So, so what's the analog, I mean, the free group, free, any algebraic structure,
just, I mean, what's the simplest case, what is the simplest case?
Simplest case is there are no relations.
Right, so in, in group presentation theory has, you know, your presentation has generators,
but no relations, right?
So it's just a freely generated group.
No, I understand, forget the group part.
If we just have something where pure binary operator is just hanging out and doesn't have
any particular relations at all, that, that's the case, the free case there.
It's a free magma, I think.
Okay, okay.
So, so in that case, is that what a magma is?
I can't remember.
Yeah, I think that's, I think Magma had some...
Magmas have closure and nothing else, I think is the, as I, if I recall.
Okay, all right, but so, so it's just this thing that's got a binary operator
but there are no relations that are true.
So it's free version has no theorems, I think.
Maybe it has a theorem that A equals A.
And maybe that's, maybe that's something to do with this closure property.
Or the thing is equal to identical things.
Well, yeah, I mean, there are things that are true just...
So, I mean, this is an effect of what paramodulation is about
in an equational theorem proving.
It's about, there are certain statements that are just structurally true by the,
by the nature of equality being an equivalence relation.
So A equals A, it's reflexive.
If A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C and that kind of stuff.
So the free, free, free case is just identical things or equals identical things.
Nothing else is true.
Well, and as you have the standard properties of an equivalence relation, right?
You have transitivity and...
Well, but that's not going to say very much.
I mean, transitivity is just saying the identical thing equals the identical thing
equals the identical thing.
It's not saying A equals B, B equals C, therefore A equals C,
which is the usual transitivity relation.
There isn't any such relation because it's only saying identical things
are the same as identical things, isn't it?
Why?
Well, if there are no relations, if there are absolutely no relations,
all you can do...
Then you may not be able to distinguish.
Yeah, yeah.
That's what you're saying.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, so now that's the absolutely free limit.
Now, what's the, what's the take that and start adding relations?
So the relations you're going to add are expression equals expression.
Right.
Impossible expressions.
So eventually, the thing will be gummed up to the point where,
first of all, it thought everything was free floating and it was,
had no relations to anything else.
And then eventually it just makes a single big blob where everything is equal.
Right.
So then the end result, the, so you're saying the boosted thing
is an everything equals everything type situation.
Yes.
So that's saying that, in a sense, there's no, what is that really saying?
From a proof theory point of view, that says that everything,
everything is connected to everything.
You've got this giant, your multi-way graph is just this,
what is it?
Just every node, it's a complete graph.
Every node is connected to every other.
True or false, true or false?
Right.
I mean, yeah, normally you'd want it to be consistent.
So in particular, you shouldn't have, in the, yeah, you shouldn't have cycles where you can...
But what is consistency, the universal algebra?
Isn't that a different story?
I mean, you can't, in other words, the notion of consistency
is a different thing from the South Braque theories.
The notion of true and false doesn't enter as such.
I mean, a group, true is not an element of a group.
No.
You know, the group just has words.
And so, but I think, okay, so what, what, what you're saying is,
I mean, the basic point, ignoring the true, false,
and claiming you can ignore when you're thinking about things out of Braque,
what, what you're saying is, is that the, in the extreme boost,
the extreme model is the model where you've poured in every possible group relation, for example.
And therefore, everything equals everything.
And so, how should we think about that?
How should we think about that?
What the heck is that?
That's a, you know, as you get closer to that limit,
okay, for, is that the same thing as saying that for a photon, time never passes?
Well, it's suddenly related, right?
I mean, I think it is, because, because for a photon,
it sees the whole history of the universe.
And, you know, it, you know, for a photon that was emitted,
you know, 100,000 years off the beginning of the universe,
and we just catch it in the cosmic microwave background for, as far as it was concerned,
it was just emitted.
And we just, you know, ended its time in that, in that random detector.
But, but so, so what this is saying, I think is that, that, okay, so time never passes for a photon,
because it, or it is, it is seeing in some sense, the whole history of the universe.
In one moment of its time, it's seeing the whole history of the universe.
So similarly, in this completely connected, you know, algebraic system,
in one relation, it is seeing every part of the algebraic system.
But does that, I think that's right.
So in other words, time in, in the algebraic system, we can think of time as being proof steps,
right?
And what this is saying is, there are no, no, in, in, you can get to everything in one proof step,
just as in the photon, you can get to everything in one moment of time.
Okay.
So, okay, I'm not sure where we're going, but that was, that was actually very interesting,
that the, the correspondence between, between sort of the infinite boost in mathematics becomes,
I mean, what is our interpretation of that, the infinite boost in mathematics is that
everything is instantly true, I think, that I, I'm not sure if that's so,
just like everything, you've, okay, anyway, I'm, I'm distracting because the original prompt was,
so you're a category for multi computation, right, right.
So I want to, but, but you were, you were making point about mathematics, which I think I did railed.
Sure. Oh, by the way, so Tarius, did you, did you have your hand raised?
Yes.
Right, right. And for the particular case of groups, I think Dugan has already
pointed out in the chat that it's, it's the, you know, up to naturalisomorphism,
it's the trivial group, right, because everything, if everything's equal to everything,
then everything's equal to the identity. So it's
Probably the relationship doesn't mean that everything is related to everything,
because one relation with a useful structure, the other relation with another structure.
And these structures, they don't, they don't bother to put each other,
but the things of all, the set of all things you can get must be something among the things
that categorize that's what the groups of a particular order.
I don't think so. Once you, once you start in enough relations,
it's just going to relate everything to everything, doesn't it?
Right. I mean, you can, you can run this experiment, if you run multiway group and
you just add more and more relations, the, the state's graph will become more and more connected.
Yeah. So what I'm saying is that when you go for some free relationships, they don't have to hold,
so to speak, if something is equal to one relation, doesn't have to be equal to the other
relations. It's just the three groups, different groups. We have some morphic structures.
I want to come back to the, the, the, this correspondence between the multiway system,
where it is theorems, where the nodes of theorems and where the nodes of groups.
Right. Because you've, that, that's what you, in some sense, maybe that's at the heart of this
notion of categorification is that you made the statement that the original multiway system,
it might be the case that nodes are theorems and then you can make a correspondence between that
and I don't understand this, so I'm trying to understand this. You can make a correspondence
between that and a multiway system where the nodes are whole groups. Right. Right. Okay. So
can you explain that? So, so the first multiway system is just the universal relations about
groups. It contains all the universal relations about groups. Right. And now you say, what is the
correspondence between that? Given that, you're saying, I mean, each blob in the thing which
has particular groups has had additional relations thrown into it. So each blob could be labeled
by its additional relations. Right. That's true. Yes. So again, this is, this is why it relates
to the duality between multiway evolution graphs and branchial graphs. So the, so the multiway
view of what's going on is you define, you know, you take some multiway evolution graph,
you define a model, it produces a sequence of branch like hyperset, you know, essentially a
sequence of branchial graphs. Then you could, you could imagine treating that sequence of
branchial graphs as a single thread in some other multiway system that's acting, it's
effectively acting on branchial graphs. But you can also consider, you know, that's just one
possible sort of foliation of the original multiway system. There are many, many different
foliations. I'm confused already at that point. In order to get from the original
giant, you've got this multiway system, it represents all possible things, all possible
theorems you can derive from pure group theory. Okay. Now you take a branchial graph out of that.
It's a slice across the whole multiway system at some time step, basically. Yes. Okay. So now I
don't understand the statement that you're taking, that those branchial graphs can be rolled up into
single nubs, because that branchial graph extends over the whole space, doesn't it? Of course. But
that's why it's a different multiway system that you're constructing. Right. I mean, again, it's
analogous to the power set construction in something like in non-deterministic computation.
Right. When you, when you convert a non-deterministic finite automaton to a deterministic one,
you're just, you're defining the deterministic finite automaton as acting on the sets of
permissible states of the non-deterministic one. Okay. In the same way, you can, you can compress
any multiway system into a single way system that's acting on the branchial graphs of the
original multiway system. That's the generalization of the power set construction. Okay. So let me
go through that for a second. Okay. So you have this multiway graph, and you can say,
I can summarize what happens in this multiway graph by just taking these spatial slices,
which are the branchial graphs, and there is a single way story, because it is just one thing
goes to, you know, one, you start at the beginning, you have a branchial graph that slices across
the whole multiway system, goes to another branchial graph and so on. But if I'm understanding
correctly, you're saying, but actually there's another thing I could do, which is instead of
looking at that single way evolution of one branchial graph with that, in this particular
affiliation of one branchial graph to that branchial graph, I could consider all possible
affiliations. Right. And that is a different encoding of the multiway graph, which is the
mapping from all, you know, a branchial graph as defined by some weird foliation. Right. And all
possible, you know, you make a branchial graph with that weird foliation, it will map to another
branchial graph and another weird foliation and another weird transversal slicing. And then you
can make problem from. Okay. So this is okay. So this leads to the question of there's a function
that like Nick wrote, and maybe you have a version of this function as well. This will simply take
a multiway graph and turn it into this dual branchial, well, maybe, maybe not. Maybe it
isn't this function. I'm not sure. But so it should be the case that you could write a function,
take a multiway graph and simply turn it into its corresponding branchial multiway graph.
Yes, I do. I do. Yeah. I have such a function. I have code that does that. Yeah. Okay. So what
is that? I never thought about that function before. I think maybe I already did in some other
world or situation, but okay. So what you're saying is, but now how do you parameterize
these weird affiliations? Are they parameterized by adding relations? In a mathematical sense,
you can presumably parameterize them by saying what relations you add. Right, exactly. In effect,
what, you know, what's new, what new orderings between state vertices are you introducing,
which is another way of saying what relations are you adding? So by ordering between state
vertices, normally it will be a slice where you've got simultaneity, so to speak, defined like this,
but sometimes you want to, you want to have your simultaneity so that you go up, right,
turn what was previously a time-like connection into, what was previously a space-like connection
into a time-like connection? Something like that. I mean, yeah, the point is that, you know,
that the rest frame is like the free case and then anything that's not the rest frame is going to
introduce new relations. Or anything which has a gravitational field, effectively, because it's
bumpy. Yes. But it doesn't even, I mean, even inertial, like, non-gravitational frames will
introduce new relations. Yes, I agree. Okay, so then what we've got is this duality, what a nice
object, this duality between the pure multiray graph and this all possible variations thing,
where each possible transversal in the multiray graph is a broad-shell graph, which can be rolled
up into a single node of the branch-shell multiray graph. Right. And my claim is that that conversion
of one multiray system to another is the kind of concretization of this functor that takes you
from the syntactical category to the semantic one, the categorical semantics. And there's a
sense in which this has been studied, there's one area that I'm aware of in which this
functorial relationship has been studied quite extensively, and that's in quantum field,
in functorial and topological quantum field there. I mean, I don't know if that's worth.
Okay, yeah, sure. Let me just absorb this big idea before we get on to the next one.
Okay. Okay, so just, I mean, the notion here, let's just try to say the same idea in a bunch
of different ways, just to understand it better. Sure. So, I mean, the, you know, the original idea
is we've got, you know, just a plain multiray graph, and which could be represented, let's say
it's a string substitution multiray graph. Okay. And now we're going to make its branch-shell
multiray graph. Right. What is the interpretation of the branch-shell multiray graph in terms of
the string of writing? What are the nodes of the branch-shell multiray graph in a string
writing system? Is that obvious? Well, they're collections of strings that have,
each node is a family of strings with certain ancestry relationships in the original multiray
system. Yeah, I understand that point. I mean, it's a branch-shell graph, but the question is,
is there a different way to say it? And just to say, in other words, in the case of,
in the case that you've interpreted in terms of group theory, one can say every node is indexed
by a collection of additional relations for the group. Right. So, oh, I see. And in the,
it's the same thing. I mean, yes, string of writing is just monoid theory. Right. Right. So,
so what you're saying is that, so, so the, so the original system is like the free monoid generated
by the axioms that you, you gave it, but you can also have restricted, you can also have
restricted monoids. So here's a way to say, the way to say it is the original graph has all these
different, let's say it's a, it's a, it's a graph where you derive in strings from strings and so
on. And you, you know, every, every node is a, is a theorem. What you're saying is, in the original
graph, you've just got theorem to theorem to theorem to theorem, every, every node is a theorem.
In the other graph, you have bags of theorems. You, you said it actually, the subset power set
construction. Right. Every, every node is a, is an element of the power set of possible theorems
from the previous graph. Right. But it's more general than the power set construction because
it's branchial and therefore also encodes ancestry information. That's the sense of which it's a
generalization of the, of the NFA DFA conversion. Let's just go through both of those pieces.
Okay. So the first statement is that you have this original graph that has a bunch of, you know,
it's essentially theorem to theorem to theorem. And there's a little bit of fuzziness there for me
because of this thing about theorems and token event graphs versus theorems as pods. And I don't
quite understand that, but let's, let's set that aside for a second. I mean, that's considered a
technical detail now. Okay. So then you're saying the first thing we want to do is instead of
thinking about it as this, you know, graph of theorem to theorem to theorem, we say it is a
big bag of theorems here that evolve to a big bag of theorems here. Right. It's the branchial,
but there's additional structure in this bag. It's not just a bag of these theorems. It's a,
it's a collection of these theorems that are branchially where we know the branchial relations
between those theorems. Right. Why does it matter that we know the branchial relations? Is that
important for reconstructing this branchial multivariate graph? So probably, so in the
metamathematics case, possibly not. I don't, I actually don't know, but one case in which it's
very important is in, as I said, the sort of the QFT case. Okay. Well, that's, that's, I think we've
absorbed, anybody have any comments or questions or about this? I understood something. At least
things coming up on Zoom. Okay, it's Dugan's comment, which I saw knows a symbolic
sentence is Nick is asking if this dual branchial multivariate graph is the union of path graphs
made by all possible affiliations with branchial graphs as dual states. I think that's true.
I think that's a good summary.
Branchial multivariate graph is a union of path graphs
made from all possible affiliations. Right. Because, because, because each,
each foliation is a path graph. It forms a path graph. And so you just take a union, right?
Just like the same way that we do, you know, multi-colonial. That's correct. That's correct.
Because that's saying that it's a, the path graph is a single way system. Yep. You've got by, by
branchial. By doing the power set of construction. Right. This is a nice subject. Okay. All right.
Now, now we prime to jump into a corner field. Well, I mean, sorry, I'm not bringing up the
QFT thing to be obscure. I'm actually bringing it up because I think it's, it's the area where this
is, where this is most concretized. I understand. I'm all for it. I'm just, I'm just, I was just
pausing for a second. That's, you know, like a digestion. Okay. All right. Let's go into corner
field there. Okay. So, yeah, as I know, we've discovered, we've discussed quite recently,
but maybe to rehash a little bit, there's a sort of, okay, you know,
one, in ordinary quantum mechanics, one has this, this, this duality between the Schrodinger and
Heisenberg pictures, right? You've got the Schrodinger, which is the Schrodinger picture,
which is kind of time evolution oriented. And you've got the Heisenberg picture,
which is sort of observable oriented. And we know that there's a, there's a way, in fact, again,
in category theory, there's an explicit functor that lets you, that encodes the passage from
one picture to the other. So there's a general. Can we just, can we just hover on that for a
second? Let's think about a quantum circuit. Yep. In a quantum circuit, you're, let's walk
through what is the Schrodinger picture for a quantum circuit? Well, the quantum circuits
are a Schrodinger picture, right? So what is the Heisenberg version of the quantum circuit?
The Heisenberg version would be something like, so the, the, if you imagine the measurement step
at the end of your quantum, that actually maps things onto real, you know, eigenstates with,
with, you know, with, with, with probabilities. If you imagine that was sort of progressing
through time rather than the unitary operators. So, you know, ordinarily in a quantum circuit,
you've got a sequence of unitary operators, these gates, and, you know, tensor products of them.
And then right at the end, you do this Hermitian measurement step. If instead you had a time
evolution of those measurement operators, rather than of the unitary operators, that would be a
kind of Heisenberg analog of a quantum circuit. Well, in one way quantum computing,
that's, that's what's done, right? So, so in, in one way quantum computing, what you do is you
set up some, some big maximally entangled resource state, and then you effectively just do local
measurements on bits of that state. And then at the end, you've got some results. And so it's a
sort of, yeah, it's a version where your, your circuit has the, has time evolution of, of measurement
gates rather than the kind of unitary gates. Let's remind ourselves just in terms of ordinary
quantum calculus. The Schrodinger picture is kind of the, the, you know, you have the wave function
and the wave function is evolving and changing what it is. Whereas in the Heisenberg picture,
you have an observable operator, like position operator or something, and you are imagining
that that evolves with time. Right, right, exactly. And, and so, but, but in terms of, let me see,
so in terms of S matrices and S matrix, which in quantum mechanics gives you this mapping
from the initial states to the final states, that is a very Schrodinger picture story.
Absolutely, yes. Right, so what is the, what is the Heisenberg picture analog of the S matrix?
Right, okay. So, well, there is a, mathematically, it's what's called a local net, a local net of
monoids. Oh boy, okay. That's why I never heard of these things, right? I used to do particle
physics. They were, they required submerging to the categorical marsh. Well, actually, I mean,
that's, that's a purely algebraic thing, right? I mean, so, because mathematically, all that's
happening is, you know, in the, basically in the Schrodinger picture, you're, you, what you care
about are linear transformations of vector spaces and, you know, the effect of vector spaces and
isomorphisms. Whereas in the Heisenberg picture, what you care about are endomorphisms and their
isomorphisms. Endomorphisms of observables to observables somehow. Yeah. I mean, the, the
algebra of observables is an algebra of endomorphism. You know, each observable is an endomorphism on
your, on your space of states. Okay, so I want to come back because I understood S matrices years ago
as, you know, the basic idea of an S matrix, which shows up a little bit, it's even in chemistry,
chemical reactions, things like that, is you've got an initial stateless system, you know, you've
got the state vector of, that represents the different possible configurations in the system,
you have a giant matrix that tells you what the new state vector is going to. Right, right. So,
the point I was going to make was that you've got, so the, all the S matrix is formally is, is, you
know, you've got two vector spaces and you want to ask what's the linear transformation between
that kind of all the S matrix is really encoding. And then, yeah, the analogous thing is you've got
two endomorphism algebras and you want to know how do I map from one to the other. And then there's
this, yeah, this, this local net construction, which I don't claim to understand particularly
well, but it's used in, in, in algebraic quantum field theory.
You probably know what the, in, in, in S matrix theory, for quantum field theory, does anybody
know, because, you know, the S matrix maps a particle, an incoming collection of particles
come in for infinity, they interact, they go out to infinity, the S matrix represents the translation
between the amplitude of the incoming particles, the amplitude of the outgoing particles.
What is the observables analog of that whole thing? Is there a picture of that? I have no
idea what the, the observables must be the correlation functions between the particles.
So this must be a, that must be the sort of mundane particle for this version of this
is some kind of statement about correlation functions and some, some mapping. Okay, so that
your, that sounds plausible. Right. So I mean, so what it must be is that the correlation functions
of the initial correlation functions as well. No, it's not initial and final.
It's a mapping between collections of correlation functions.
Right. Funky. Okay. And what is the, remind me, the interaction picture is some intermediate
version of this. Right, exactly, exactly. So, so, so, so part of the evolution is taken on by this,
by this, effectively the states in your, in your Herbert space, part of the evolution is taken
on by the, by the endomorphism, by the observables. Okay, so we've roughly got this picture where,
I mean, for me, as a mundane particle physicist, it's kind of the, you know,
initial state to final state versus correlation functions to correlation, you know,
collections of correlation functions to collections of correlation functions.
Right, right. Okay. That sounds reasonable. Okay. So that's the, you know,
Schrodinger versus Heisenberg picture, you think. Right. Okay. So now, now, so now explain that
you're going to explain algebraic versus, right, right. So, so functorial field theory is essentially
the Schrodinger picture, but in the more general, you know, QFT context. So now you've, you've got
some spacetime, you've got some manifold. And you can imagine take, you can imagine looking at
co-dimension one, you know, slices, effectively space, like space like hypersurfaces in that manifold.
Or branch shell graphs, which are, which are, you know, branch shell slices are co-dimension one.
Oh, but crucially, we're in spacetime right now. Right. So this is, this is, these are, these would
be fullyations of a causal graph rather than of a multi-way system. Okay. Okay. At least for now,
they will become branch shell graphs in a moment. But so, all right. So you look at these co-dimensional
one slices, and then you want, and then effectively you want to compute a, an S-match. So, you know,
you've got these two manifolds, say they're, you know, in four dimensions, these would be three
dimensional space like hypersurfaces. And then you want to, you want to connect them along their
boundaries. You want to define some co-borderism between them. Right. Let's get the original picture.
So we've got, we imagine a causal graph that represents the evolution history of the universe.
And then we imagine a foliation of that causal graph that represents a, essentially a spacelike
hypersurface that has, and you're saying that, that spacelike hypersurface is, has a three-manifold,
has a three-dimensional manifold, that is that spacelike hypersurface. And look at three dimensions
in the case of an ordinary three-plus one-dimensional space. Right. And so if you, if you have two of
those, if you have an initial and final hypersurface, then you could imagine gluing the boundaries
together in some way, right? These are infinite. Well, okay. These are not necessarily. They don't
have to be infinite. No. So there's some big blob of space. Yeah. And if, and if they are infinite,
then they, then, you know, they inherit the boundary structure of the spacetime they're embedded.
There's a blob of space. It's the shape of a, you know, it's some drum that's in some particular
shape. You have another blob of space. It's a drum in another shape. Right. Now, which boundaries
are you going together? Well, I mean, you're gluing the entire boundary of one to the entire
boundary of the other. I mean, that's, that's what the co-boarders and relationship is.
Yeah, I understand that. Why, why do you want to do that? Well, because ultimately what you want to
do is compute an S matrix for, you know, if the, if the first thing is your initial configuration,
the last hypersurface is your final configuration, and you want, you want to define an S matrix for
a process of a given shape. By shape, you mean you're conforming the boundaries of these things?
Right, right. And so, so the, so the possible shapes of field theoretic processes are given by
the possible co-boarders of those manifolds. So, okay, so we've got these manifolds. This is,
this is a quantum gravity story. This is not a, this is not a quantum field theory. So it's about,
this is about, it's both quantum gravity and, but also on a more mundane level,
just topological quantum field theory, which is kind of, I mean, you described this as a causal
graph. Whereas, I mean, doesn't it have to be a multi-way graph to get to quantum stuff?
Well, yes, we'll see that in a moment. Yes. Okay, but first of all, we've got one manifold,
and we've got another manifold that is from a later slice of a causal graph.
Right. And you're saying, co-boardism is this idea of being able to, you know,
knit these things together so that their boundaries agree. Right. And, and then you're asking,
you're saying, there is some, what are you computing about the, the interior,
is somehow one is evolving to the other. Right, exactly. And you want to know the
amplitude associated with that evolution. Okay, but I don't know how amplitude comes into this yet.
Well, okay. So, right. So, so now, now if you imagine it as a quantum mechanical thing,
so now these are effectively multi-way causal graphs. And so you've got, so you've got multiple,
you know, hyperserve, multiple space like hyperservices distributed in branch-shell space,
if you're connecting those boundaries, and you want to know what's the amplitude associated with
that collection of evolution pods. But why are we not doing this purely in the multi-way graph?
So we have the multirate graph, we have a branch-shell graph here from the multi-way graph,
we have another branch-shell graph here, we look at the co-boardism of the multi-
branch-shell graphs. What does that correspond to? Isn't that an ordinary quantum mechanical
amplitude? Yes, yes. Okay, close to a quantum field theoretical. Right, right. Because the whole,
the whole thing that distinguishes QM from QFT is that you have to, you also have to take the
causal structure into account with the QF, you know, you have to take some spatial structure,
some, right, to genuinely believe in spatial structure. Right, right. Because the difference,
I mean, the, okay. Yeah, in a sense, somehow, you know, general relativity is the approximation
you get when you ignore the multi-way structure and you just look at hypergraph evolution.
Quantum mechanics is what you get if you ignore the hypergraph structure and you just do,
look at the multi-way evolution. That's so beautiful. I mean, that's, that's the,
one of the main kind of punchlines of the whole physics project. Right. And QFT quantum
gravity is some mix of the two. Right. QFT being the more structured case. Right, right. So, okay,
you know, this relates to a question that was asked by one of the summer cap kids about,
what is the rural analog quantum computing? So you didn't get that. This is the question of,
if quantum computing is following the different paths of the multi-way graph, what happens if
you follow different paths of the rural multi-way graph? And what is the, you know, is there a way
of accessing rural quantum computing, so to speak? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. There isn't really a,
at least in my mind, there isn't really a sharp distinction between an ordinary multi-way system
and a rural multi-way system. Right. It all comes down to how you encode the parameter,
you know, the original parameter space of your rules. Yes. And so, you know, you could imagine,
for instance, building a quantum circuit that used, you know, you could, you could have two
different circuit, you know, you could have Clifford plus T gates, and you could also have,
you know, you know, something that includes, that's just stabilized the quantum mechanics
with some different gate sets or something. And then you could imagine merging those two and
building some quantum circuit that combines both. And in some encoding, that's like,
that's an allegation of a rural multi-way system. Sorry, I'm not convinced there's that sharp a
divide. Well, but maybe the ultimate divide, which is not unrelated to some of the things you're
talking about, is you've got a whole factory of gates. You've got all possible. You apply all
possible unitary transformations. Right. The question is, is that a realizable thing? That is,
is there a way of, I mean, you know, we, we try with quantum computing, people are making this
big effort to kind of constrain what kind of physical processes can happen. Maybe the statement
of the rural limits is you allow all these physical processes to happen. It's not just
these particular ones, you're constrained to happen. Right. So in a sense, the rural,
yeah, but this is the answer that the rural, you know, the rural analog of quantum computing
is just all possible physics happens and you must pick your answer out of the all possible
things that happened. In other words, unlike, well, except that's not, that's not quite true,
because that's not how it works in ordinary quantum computing. Well, in ordinary quantum computing,
you have to knit your answer. Yeah, you have to, you have to get things to interfere in a way that,
so I mean, ultimately, I think it ends up being an observer theoretic, you know, the final step
ends up being an observer theoretic thing. It's not, you're selecting the answer from some God's
eye picture. It's you, you know, you actually have to sculpt some reference frame that picks
the answer out for you. Right. All right. Let's go back from the rural limits of quantum
computers, which I think would be, you know, if basically the basic theory of these things is
first it goes branch ill, then it goes really, and then that's the end. So is quantum computing
speed real or is it an illusion? I'm pretty sure it's an illusion. But I mean, I'm pretty sure
that the observer, you know, that the knitting together of things, and maybe we'll maybe even
some of the things John is talking about right now will help clarify that, that the, you know,
the extent to which, I mean, when you think about your observer, observables versus Schrodinger picture,
the basic idea of quantum computing has to be that in the Schrodinger type picture, you know,
okay, my, a version of what you can say about quantum computing speedup is the Schrodinger
picture is enough. The measurement doesn't matter. Whereas there's a different picture
that you could take that, you know, not less the question is, is that, is that sufficient?
Is the Schrodinger piece sufficient? Or does the measurement, you know, does the measurement
actually take effort? And I think this duality with these observables might actually tell you
something about that. What do you think? Yes, yeah, I mean, I mean, in effect, Paul's question is a
question of branchial cosmology, right? What you're asking is, in a sense, what is the value of omega,
but for branchial expansion rather than from for spatial expansion? And because that will
effectively factor into the question of, can your branch, can branchial space expand rapidly enough
that the forward time evolution speedup exceeds the slowdown you get from having to,
you know, to actually apply the observation process? Yeah, I mean, I think this is like,
okay, the claim would be quantum computing is the analog and branchial space of something like
perpetual motion. So, you know, the reason that there's, you know, there is in fact perpetual
motion physical space, and it has to do with the expansion of the universe. That is, you can get,
you know, and it's, you know, if you have a big wire, a big, big spring connects two galaxies,
that are distant galaxies in the universe, that spring will get more and more attention in it
as a result of the expansion of the universe. I mean, at least if the spring isn't too big,
it doesn't affect the expansion of the universe and so on. But that sense in which you can,
you can get energy, like energy is not conserved in full cosmology. And I don't do cosmologists
I haven't really followed the recent stories of energy conservation and cosmology. I mean,
it's basically there isn't a Hamiltonian formulation in which energy is truly concerned.
Right, no. No, no. That hasn't changed. That hasn't changed. Well, I mean,
resolving that question is equivalent to resolving strong cosmic censorship in some form.
Explain that. Well, because being able to write down, so we don't even know whether there exists
a Hamiltonian formulation of GR that's applicable to our universe, right? That's really what the
strong cosmic censorship conjecture is. And explain that in terms of, remind me,
what is the strong cosmic censorship versus weak? Okay, so the strong weak cosmic censorship of both
statements about effectively whether GR is a, whether you can, whether you can pose the
Einstein field equations as a well posed initial value problem, you know, essentially as a well
posed system of hyperbolic PDEs, weak cosmic censorship is a kind of local version of that,
which says that you can't, that you can't have, you know, C1 future in extendable regions of
space time that effectively correspond to naked singularities, right? Strong cosmic censorship
is a global version of that statement that effectively says you could define, you know,
that the evolution of the universe is in at least relativistically is determined by some
initial Cauchy data defined at, you know, at some t equals zero point. So let's just unpack
this for a second. So you're saying in the case of weak cosmic censorship, if we've formed, let's
talk about it just in terms of black holes, we, we, you know, or space time singularities as in
the curvature tensor goes to infinity type thing. Right, right. But so I mean, the cosmic censorship
conjectures are really statements about hyperbolic analysis, right? So analytically what's happening
is, well, what does it mean for a hyperbolic system of equations to become ill-posed? Well,
it means your characteristic lines intersect, right? And in general relativity, the characteristic
lines have a very direct physical interpretation, which is that they are the paths taken by
time like rays, right? They're the normal vectors to your space like hypersurfers.
They're where light goes in space time. Right. I mean, yeah. Right. And so those, your hypers,
and when you think about that geometrically as those light rays being normal vectors to your
space like hypersurfers, you realize they can only intersect if the space like hypersurfers is
intersect. And so, and that's exactly what happens in a singularity, right? So singularity is a place
where characteristic lines converge and so the field equations become ill-posed there.
But, and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture says, okay, well, that's fine because they're cloaked in
this, in this, you know, those singularity regions are cloaked in this event horizon,
which means that although, you know, technically your theory becomes ill-posed, you know, there is
a region where you can't see one future extend your time like curves. It's okay because they're
kind of, they're sealed off from the rest of the universe. Strong cosmic, so that's really a statement
about black holes in the event horizon. Strong cosmic censorship conjecture is a statement at the
level of the entire universe, whether that happens at a global scale rather than just at a local
scale. Well, but so the strong version does not have a, does not have the event horizon.
A strong version doesn't really say anything about black holes, right? It's, it's, it's,
it's whether the singularity is whether, I mean, it's like if you have fluid dynamics and you look
at the future evolution of the nanostome equations, do you ever get infinite velocity, infinite density
regions of the nanostome equations? Right, right. I mean, concretely here, it's a consequence of the
fact that even though it's one of those necessary but not sufficient things, right, you're, you're,
if you have a singularity, it forces your characteristic lines to intersect, but the
characteristic lines can intersect without forming a singularity. And that's really the case with
this, which the strong sense of conjecture is addressing. And so effectively those conjectures,
we know there are space times which they fail, but they're saying, you know, for physically
reasonable space times given by some, some energy conditions that the, you know, these things should
be true. And so having a well posed, hyperbolic, Hamiltonian formulation of GR is predicated in
some sense on, on the, on the conspicuous conjecture being true. So, so we, like, we can't even
really address the question of, of energy conservation. If space time kind of self-destructs,
assessing the total energy of space time doesn't really matter. So, so, okay, so, so then that's,
that's the case of, so, you know, the issue is in Braunschild space, what is the corresponding
rate of expansion? And so the, the, the claim would have to be quantum computing, as Jonathan was
saying, basically that if the rate of Braunschild expansion is high enough, then you might be able
to get something by basically doing the equivalent of the perpetual motion machine in physical space
time, but in Braunschild space. Right. But the place, the thing you brought up, which is this
connection to, you know, sort of vector spaces and isomorphisms versus endomorphism, algebraism,
the other isomorphism. I mean, the, the, the place where those things connect to Paul's question
is, you know, in what sense is it that the multi-way evolution graph models, you know,
linear transformations models the Schrodinger picture and what sense is the Braunschild
graphs model endomorphisms and they model the Heisenberg picture? Well, the reason is because
ultimately it comes down to something as simple as the evolution edges in the multi-way evolution
picture are directed and in the Braunschild graph, they're not. So in particular, when you, when you
reverse everything, which is the analog of a Hermitian adjoint, that's the analog of taking
your conjugate transpose. In the multi-way evolution graph, time goes backwards. So that's
like unitary evolution. In the Braunschild graph, it remains the same. So that's the analog of,
of, of Hermiticity. So in effect, it's the, the, the, the, the, it's in that sense, we can say the
Braunschild graphs are sort of modeling, endomorphism, algebras of some kind. And so then in effect,
Paul's question is, you know, you've got this apparent speed up that comes from the fact that
you can do many, you know, in the same amount of time, you can do many, many more linear
transformations because your Braunschild graph is expanding. But eventually you're going to have to
apply those, those, you know, you're going to have to apply those endomorphisms. You're going to have
to perform those observations that collapse. Anytime you've got a pair of states connected by a
Braunschild edge, you've got to collapse those back to one state eventually. And it's not clear,
a priori, because it depends on the structure of the multi-way system, whether the slowdown from
having to do those observations of collapsing things along Braunschild edges is going to outweigh
the speed up you've got from being able to do the things in parallel in the first place. And that's
ultimately the question of whether, you know, true quantum speed up is possible.
But in these terms, we should be able to figure this out. I mean, that is, what characteristics,
I'm looking at Yorick, because he's thought about multi-way graphs in this kind of way.
The question is, under what circumstances does the number of parallel threads
outweigh, because what you're asking is, how many, you know, can you have a bunch of parallel
threads in the multi-way graph that do not require so much knitting in the Braunschild
graph to get them all back together again? And you might think, every time you have a parallel,
every time you have a branch in the multi-way graph, that's going to lead to one piece of knitting
in the Braunschild graph that's going to require, so every time you have a pair of
parallel edges, that is one piece of knitting that you have to do. So the question is, when,
you know, is it the case that what you have is just a whole cascade of loose ends,
which you then have to knit together, and where the amount of knitting you have to do is simply
proportional to the number of loose ends. If the amount of knitting is proportional to the
number of loose ends, then quantum computing is toast, because that necessarily will just be
the same work. You have to do the same work to knit the things together, as you would have had
to do to just follow it pass separately. So can I rephrase that as the question being,
whether it is physical to have rules that collapse a large number of parallel threats
and introduce a bunch of Braunschild edges in one single step, which such rules exist, right?
The question is if they are physical, or if they have physical interpretations. Is that
the correct reason? I'd say that it's more like, is the number of rules that you'd need to introduce
in order to collapse things down to a single state comparable to the number of evolution
edges that you've gained by doing the computation of parallel in the first place?
But this question about the number of new rules you have to introduce, this is an observer theory
story. That's a question of whether the observer has, I mean, we don't yet know how to think about
a good metamodal observer. I don't yet know that. And so the question is, is there a
you know, in that metamodal, could you get a boatload of, I don't know, it seems like
as soon as you physicalize the observer, you'll never be able to win. Because those rules,
if you have to enumerate all these separate rules, those all have to be sort of,
my intuition is those have to be separately physicalized. My guess is that in the end,
it's just going to be exactly the same. That it's just going to be that you can do this
quantum computing. And it's the, you know, one of them is thinking about, in fact, it's exactly
the description that Jonathan is giving of this foliation versus vibration story, because one
of them is going to be, you know, the classical evolution is just you follow a single fiber.
And the quantum evolution is you're going foliation, foliation, foliation slice to foliation
slice. And in the end, you know, a foliation slice doesn't give you an answer, you have to
compress the foliation slice. And the story will be, it's just going to take you exactly the same
effort to do the measurement, as it's going to take you to do the original classical computation.
Right. My guess. Right. And so it's a reformulation. So in a sense,
from that point of view, quantum mechanics is a mere reformulation of classical, you know,
at the commutational level, quantum computing is a mere reformulation of classical computation
that will be the basic statement. Right. Well, it's another one of those power set constructions,
right? In a sense, which I mean, so, you know, classic classical simulation of quantum computation
is, you know, essentially, what is something like this, right? It's the, it's the, you know,
do it evolving the branchial graphs directly rather than evolving the whole multi-layer system.
Yeah, right. So I give a restructuring on factorial versus algebraic.
I was also going to, sorry, things that we're now, whatever, several tangents deep. I do on the,
on the metamodelling of observers thing. So I know we've previously discussed Robin Gandy's
PhD thesis and how it kind of missed the point of a lot of, it was Robin Gandy's PhD thesis,
because I was trying to figure out what Robin's, Robin Gandy's handwriting looked like. Right.
Because I had this random sheet of paper. Okay, this is a, this isn't a relevant story, but
I wrote about this in some posts that I wrote, but a former high school teacher of mine
was a friend of Alan Turing's. And somehow when Alan, when Alan Turing died,
this former high school teacher of mine got a bunch of books from Alan Turing.
When my former high school teacher died, he gave those books to, well, various places,
but including one was to another former high school teacher of mine with the instructions,
give this book to sort of, it may have been basically to give this book to me, but it was
to give this book to a very case. So eventually I get this book, which is actually a copy of
Dirac's quantum mechanics in German. Okay, just slightly obscure, because after all,
Turing was English, but anyway, he had Dirac's quantum mechanics in German. So I'm literally
sitting there, this person just handed me this book. And I thought, you know, it's an interesting
old book, I should just flip through the pages. So I flipped through the pages and what should
happen, but a piece of paper flutters out. And a piece of paper had on it, a bunch of
combinators meets lambda calculus, which is pretty weird for a book about quantum mechanics.
And so then I went on to sort of hunt of, you know, who wrote this piece of paper,
and that was an adventure. And was it Alan Turing's handwriting? Was it whose handwriting was it?
And I consulted with this person, I know who's a forensic handwriting specialist and all sorts
of other things, who said, and she immediately said, it's not Alan Turing's handwriting,
and gave a whole bunch of personality analysis of why I couldn't, but that's a,
that's a sort of a different story. But anyway, the end result was eventually this was tracked down
to, oh my gosh, what's his name? Oh my gosh, the executor of Gandhi's will. So basically, the
Gandhi was the executive of Turing's will. Robin Gandhi was the executive of Turing's will.
And this person in Wales was the executive of Robin Gandhi's will. Anyway, we tracked all these
various people down. And in the end, bottom line was the piece of paper in the book was written
by Robin Gandhi, who had somehow had this book for some intermediate period of time. Therefore,
that is a very, very shaggy story. But that's why I looked at Robin Gandhi's p2 thesis was because
it had handwritten stuff for Robin Gandhi. That was sort of definitively his.
And it's why I spent two afternoons grubbing around the archive center of King's College,
Cambridge, taking photographs of Richard Bevan Braithwaite's collected correspondence.
Right. Turned out and then, right. Okay, so, so.
And interviewing people at Heffers, as I recall.
Oh, yeah, that was another one. There was also a bookmark in this book. And the bookmark came
from Heffers, which is a bookstore in Cambridge. And the bookmark question was how old was the
bookmark? And the bookmark had a phone number on it. And it was a phone number that, you know,
British phone numbers gradually got longer over time, as these things do when, you know,
when commentarily you need that. And so this was a particular length of phone number.
Turned out that bookmark had been used for like 40, 50 years or something. They've been using the
same bookmark, which kind of might tell you something about British businesses of that time
for something like this. But yeah, and we also tracked down Champanel, who was another candidate.
Champanel was a, was a friend of, I was a friend of Turin's famous for the Champanel number,
which is the number 0, 0.12345678910111213, which is the number that has the property.
It's a normal number. Anyway, Champanel was also involved in chess machines and things,
but later became a well-known economist, it turns out. And anyway, so we tracked down some
handwriting samples. I don't know whether you're involved in that part, the handwriting samples
of Champanel. Because I've now had multiple pieces of email from people asking me things
about Champanel and handwriting samples. So who knows, it's, it's, one gets tangled up in these
historical stories. They're, you know, they lead to things like people saying, you know,
I am the granddaughter of famous scientist X. And in our attic, we have many boxes of interesting
notes from, you know, the grandfather or the great grandfather. And I have a great urge to go
look at these boxes in many cases, but it takes a bunch of time. Anyway, this is,
I'm sorry, that was, it was, it was the only, like, on the ground detective story I've ever been
directly involved in. Right. It's not, not as dramatic, probably, as the Schoenkel story,
which we digress. Sorry. The point I was going to make was that, so one of the, so most of
Gandhi's PhD thesis is pretty boring. But the, the, the second half of it actually has a bunch,
has a couple of interesting ideas. And one of the interesting ideas was that he was, I mean,
he didn't quite, he didn't formulate it in these terms, but my reading of what he was trying to
do, which is quite interesting, it was, he was essentially trying to construct a formal model
analogous to a Turing machine that would take in effectively data and output scientific
hypotheses. And so he was trying to construct, I mean, he was trying to do it in the language
of type theory, which I think was completely sort of inappropriate as a choice of mathematical
formalism. But he was really trying to construct what I would now characterize as being a meta
model of the observer. And the interesting thing is, because of this known connection between
sort of type theory and categorical semantics, I have a suspicion that the meta model of the
observer that at least I've been implicitly using in terms of branchial completion has
a formulation in terms of Gandhi's original formalism. So what would you output? So, okay,
if the output is, you know, it's just like people say, you know, mathematicians are machines for
turning coffee in the theorems or something. This is a machine for turning scientific data
into hypotheses about, into scientific laws, which is, I mean, kind of that's the story of
statistics. That's the story of the scientific of science in general, is turning of experimental
science, natural, experimental science, shouldn't say natural science, natural science.
Which also the story of, I mean, more abstractly, it's the story of cryptanalysis, right? You're
given the output, you're just given the output or partial output of some computational system,
if you're asking what rules generated it. Yes. I mean, so, okay, but so you're saying,
in that picture, you're saying, did Gandhi make progress on having some, so
we've parametrized the use that generated. So we're saying the system, since we can now
represent everything in terms of computation, the thing, the output is just a program.
Right. I see. So the basic point is, it's a code versus data story. And normally the code makes
the data, but this is the case where the data is making code. Right. Right. Oh yeah, that's
interesting. So that's basically the theory of, so that's a core way to think about observer theory,
is that whereas a turning machine turns code into data, basically, an observer has to turn
data into code. Interesting idea. Right. Okay. And it's, I mean, it's one of the reasons why,
in a sense, things like combinators are interesting because they, you know,
they don't have that distinction. Yeah, the code versus data. Right. Right. Well,
not as well as language. That's true. That's true. There's a, there's a, based on, yeah,
there's a programming language theory for that, a theory term for that, isn't it? It's like,
unimodular or something. It's not unimodular, but no, it's, it's someone's
meta-circuit. Okay. But, okay. So what you're saying is, given data emit, you know,
what's the formulation in terms of combinators? You would say, given,
what is the representation? See, the problem is, it's not obvious what the model actually does.
And maybe that's related to your kind of model's idea and what, how you knit things together
branchially. Right. Right. But I mean, for instance, one concretization of that is,
you're given the causal semantics for a combinator evaluation. Can you reconstruct
what the combinator was? Well, okay. Here's a simpler version of that. You're given,
you're given a collection of combinator expressions. Can you generate a single
combinator expression on whose multi-way graph, those combinator expressions occur?
Right. Which is to say that you've got essentially a branchial, but you can think of that as a
branchial graph of combinator expressions. And you're asking, is there a, you know,
is there a, is there a generator that produces that, that branchial graph? Which you could also
think of in terms of your branchial to branchial evolution. Is there a branchial graph that
generates that branchial graph? Or you could say, is there a, you know, is there, is there an
underlying sort of Schrodinger picture, you know, multi-way generator that, you know,
multi-way thing that generates that? Right. Okay. That's interesting. So, so back.
Yeah. Sorry. Robin Gandhi tangent, probably not, not necessary.
No, no, that was very interesting. I mean, the, you know, code to data, data to code,
that's really quite an interesting way to think about. Right. And I think this model of, you know,
can you make a, a combinator, which has a specified set of combinators as it's multi,
as its branchial thing? I mean, see, that's, that's a very interesting thing for another reason,
which is we've been interested in what does it mean to do multi-computational universality.
And so this is an interpretation of that, which is to say, you know, find a computation
where on the branchial graph, you have certain kinds of things generate. That's very different
from the, from the question of, you know, if you're doing an NP computation, right, that's,
there's probably a term for that. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't a computational complexity
theory. Normally an NP computation, it's like there are many possible branches. And the question is,
is there a winner? Is there a single branch that's the winner? So this is the question of,
is there a, of all the branches, do you get a certain set if you look across all the branches?
Is there a name for that in computational complexity theory? Anybody know? I mean, it's,
it's one that I'm aware of. I mean, because that's, that's, I think, a different concept.
Although, although again, I mean, in relation to the, in terms of the relationship to, to multi-computational
universality, I again have to stress that I have concerns about the syntax semantics distinction,
right? Because, you know, you're, you're making a statement about what, you know, for instance,
what specific combinator expressions were produced on a given branch like hypersurface. But that's
not, that's not the important thing from a universality point of view, right? It's not,
it's not important, you know, saying that a system is universal is not equivalent to saying that it
generates all, you know, combinator expressions of a particular kind or something. Right, right,
right. Exactly. What universality is, is more of, you have to have an encoding of, of what the
combinator expressions mean. And then, you know, it has to be, you know, the, the, that, the combinator
evaluation has to be a, has to be subjective onto that encoding, but not subjective onto the actual
syntax. Let me give you an outrageous version of this. Question is, can you, on the Braunschild
graph, reconstruct the time history of an arbitrary chart machine? Right, right. That's a version,
that's a definition of multi, multi-computational universality, right? A bizarre idea. So that's
turning a time series into a Braunschild series. Right. So that's saying, you know, normally, and
if you go long enough, can you reproduce an arbitrary long time history of the Turing machine
in the Braunschild direction? So what is that like? That's like in, I mean, in the ADS-CFT world
of that correspondence. What else is that like? That's like saying, I mean, that is, in fact,
that's reconstructing light rays from, from, you know, spatial structure or something.
Yeah, something like that. Right. But that's a good, that's a good case. I mean, of looking at
term, you know, can you, that's the thing I could actually do experiments on is, is there a Braunschild
correspondence for that term? You know, Braunschild history reconstruction. Right. Are we, are we,
are we, are we now ready to start back? Yeah, I forget what we were saying. Yes. All right,
that's, I was, I was on the first line of explaining what an FQFT is. Right. So, you know,
you, you've got this co-borderism between these space like hypersurfaces. And then the point is,
you know, when you, when you go multi-way, so to speak, now you associate to the, to the two
initial, you know, co-dimension one surfaces, you now got some space of states, right? You've got
some vector space that's the space of quantum states. And, you know, in the multi-way system,
that's going to be some, some branch, you know, some collection of, of state vertices in some,
in some Braunschild graph. And then your, your co-borderism, but the connect to them is some
linear transformation, right? And that's the thing that's encoded by your S matrix. The S matrix
is concretely the linear transformation that takes you from one vector space to the other.
Yep. But the, but, and that's effectively what FQFT is all about. So in, in functorial quantum field
theory, you know, the, the, the core ideas go back to the, the so-called sewing laws that
effectively encode the locality of time evolution in terms of functoriality, right? So you, so
ordering quantum field theory has a time evolution given by the path integral.
Right. That is just like what you're saying. It maps one quantum state to another quantum state.
Right. And those quantum states can be thought of as correspondents of Braunschild graphs.
Right. And so. So ordering quantum field theory with the path integral just does that.
Right. So in trying to come up, in trying to nail down a mathematically precise version of what,
what the path integral is, Michael LaTea made an initial proposition, which was then slightly
refined by Graham Siegel for the case of topological field theories. But the idea was,
you know, one principle that your path integral is absolutely satisfied as locality of time
evolution. In other words, if you've got, if you've got, you know, if you've got a co-borderism
sigma, and you, you know, you take the path integral for that co-borderism, but that co-borderism
can be, can be decomposed into a, into a disjoint union of, you know, sigma one and sigma two,
it should, then the path integral for sigma should be equal to the sum of the path integral
for sigma one and sigma two. Sum? Not product? Well, I mean, I'm using sum in the, I mean,
it would be a direct sum or, or a semi direct product or whatever, depending on, depending
on exactly how you, I would, I would realise. And you've got paths in sigma one, and they
lead into paths of sigma two. And each one has a, has a, I see, if you're doing it in terms of the
actual amplitudes in quantum field theory of your product. Right. And in terms of, I see, in terms
of the paths, this is sum of paths. Right. Right. Okay. By the way, just for my historical
information, that must have post-dated my interaction with Michael LaTea and my
paying attention to quantum field theory. When was that? Uh, well, the, the Atea Segal
paper, the one that I'm aware, well, the one by Segal at least is, is from 1986, I think,
where he formalises the sewing axioms. That's, that's, that's, that's post, post your high-energy
phase. Okay. So these axioms then have this, have certain properties for these cobaltisms.
Right. Well, I mean, so the, the really beautiful thing, the reason why, you know,
TQFT got so deeply connected to category theory was this realisation that, well, what the
sewing axioms really say is equivalent to the statement of functoriality, right? Functoriality
is the statement that, you know, uh, if you, if you, that, uh, that your functor, your mapping
between categories respects composition. So F of, you know, if, if F, big F is your functor and
you've got morphisms A and B, F of A compose B is F of A compose F of B. Well, now, if your,
if your time evolution is a functor, then the, then functoriality is precisely the statement of
locality. Let's go through this. I, I think I understand this. Right.
The, the, so, you know, in a standard category set up, one of the key aspects of category
theory is this compositionality idea. But if you can go, if you have a mapping, you know,
A and a amount of morphism, A and a morphism B, then you also have a morphism A compose B.
Right. Uh, yeah. So it's, so long as they share, you know, domain and co-domain in, in the obvious
way. Right. But okay. But then the idea of a functor is you've got this series of mappings
that are these morphisms and a functor says you might have parallel sort of in two different
categories. You have parallel, you know, chains of morphisms and the functor takes you from one
category to another. And this statement is that the structure of the morphisms in one category
are preserved by the functor, you know, in the structure of the morphisms in the other category.
Right. Right. Exactly. So now, so now let's, let's, um, uh, let's understand what that means
in terms of, of these, um, of the statement that the, the full co-bordism path into little
Sigma is decomposable into Sigma one and Sigma, any decomposition. So Sigma one and Sigma two,
you can think of as morphisms or no, those are fun. No. So, okay. So, so what's really going on is,
okay, you've got two categories here. Right. There's the, there's the category of manifolds and
their co-bordisms. Right. So, so effectively the objects are manifolds. The, uh, the morphisms are
co-bordisms between those manifolds. And there's also a tensor product. There's also a monoidal
structure, which is just disjoint unions of manifolds and co-bordisms. Um, so you've got this one
symmetric monoidal category of, which is called boards of just, you know,
end dimensional co-bordisms. And you've got some other symmetric monoidal categories, some other
category equipped with a tensor product structure, which is the category of vector spaces. Right.
So, so each object is a vector space or some Hilbert space in the finite dimensional case.
Um, and, uh, yeah, each morphism is some of the near transformation. And there's also a tensor
product, which is just the usual tensor product of Hilbert spaces. Um, and then, so in a sense,
abstractly, what the quantum field theory is, is a functor that takes you from one to the other.
Right. It's the thing that, that takes the specification in terms of space time of your,
of your process shape and maps it to an S matrix. Right. That's what that functor is encoding,
the passage from, from one to the other. Hold on. Hold on. So, so you're saying the S matrix is this
mapping this linear algebra type thing, mapping from this vector space to another vector space.
Right. And, and so. But then you also, on the other side, you've got this picture of hyper,
you know, manifolds and, and, and co-bordisms. And so in a sense, you, so, you know, what,
what do you want from a quantum field theory? Well, somehow what you want to some machine that
you give me a pair, you give me an incoming space like hypersurface, an outgoing space like hypersurface,
some, some process that connects them. And I want to be able to crank some handle and get out an S
matrix. And that's what that functor is doing. Right. So there's some symmetric monoidal functor
from this category of co-bordisms to this category of vector spaces. So another thing to say is,
in a sense of quantum field theory, in quantum mechanics, psi, you know, the wave function
gives you, you know, you given an X and psi of X returns an amplitude. Right. And that's, that's
what it's, that's its role. A field operator, given, given a given field operator tells you for
how to think about this, it tells you the whole occupation, a whole stack of occupation numbers
for any given point. What is the field operator? What's the, because this is, this is what you're
talking about, is your, your vector space thing, the, the instantaneous moments inside the operation
of the S matrix are a series of states of the field operator. Right. But what is that? What is
that? What is, how do we think about the field operator? What's the, gosh, it's a long time
since I thought about this. The field operator takes, I mean, the whole point of a quantum field
and quantum mechanics, we just have one analogy. And it is the amplitude in an electron. What is
the amplitude that the electron is this position of that position? In quantum field theory, it's a
stack of things in the Fox space, where you're saying there can be one electron, two electrons,
three electrons, et cetera. And at each point in space, the field operator tells you what the,
what the essentially amplitudes of every possible number of particles at that point are. So, so
this is, so this now is asking you, so that's the microscopic version of the, of the S matrix
at the moment in time. Right. So how does that, how does that? Well, I mean, it's, it's important
to know, so far everything I've said is just quantum mechanical will make it field theoretic in a moment.
Right. So, so that, yeah, this, this locality of time, you know, the, the locality of time
evolution that you want from your path integral is now just a statement that this functor is a
functor, right? That if you, that when you, when you take disjoint unions of manifolds and
co-borderisms, they map to essentially just matrix products in the, you know, in the category of
vector spaces and linear, linear, there's a factorial correspondence between the, the, the, the sort
of the partial, a little piece of co-borderism evolution, so to speak. Right. A little piece
of vector space evolution. Right. And so you can split it, you can split them up however you, you
know, as much as you like, right? That's what the locality is saying. That you could say, you know,
the, the steps in this co-borderism evolution are one step and then multiplied by another step.
And that's like two pieces of an S matrix, the initial S matrix, the final S1 and S2. And then
you just take a matrix product. Right. Exactly. And this is the same as the sigma 1, sigma 2
successor relation. Right. Right. But the important point here, though, is that we've, we've, in doing,
in constructing that, we've already assumed effectively a default time slicing. Right. We've
assumed, we've assumed a gauge choice in, in how we've broken up the co-borderism, you know,
between these two. Whereas we don't even know how that works in the S matrices because that,
because in the S matrices, if we thought about that in terms of Feynman diagrams,
we'd be having a bunch of particle lines and then we'd be deciding in this, in fact, it's kind of
amusing that the Feynman diagram is itself a graph and you could imagine essentially
foliating the Feynman diagram graph just as you could imagine foliating this whole effect.
Well, you know, not, not to seem like too much of like a category salesman, but that, that's not,
that's actually not so much of a coincidence when you appreciate the compositional structure of what's
happening. A Feynman diagram is a string diagram for the, for the symmetric monoidal category of
vector spaces and their isomorphisms. Right. Which kind of makes sense when you think about it.
Right. Right. Right. Okay. But yeah. So, so, and obviously we don't know how to do this in general,
because in a sense, if we knew how to do this in general, we'd have solved quantum gravity.
But we know that, you know, in order to get quantum field theory, you at least have to consider some,
you have to mod out by gauge choices in some sense, right? And so this is why these, so, so, you know,
in a sense quantum mechanics is like the one category case where you've already assigned,
you predestined your, your time slicing, but then you could imagine having higher morphisms. You
could imagine having, if you imagine several different possible time slicing in your co-borderism
category and then gauge transformations being higher morphisms between them, then you get some,
some n category of co-borderisms and some n category of vector spaces. And, and, and then, and that's,
so, so in a sense, this is, this is one of the reasons why I think this is such a mathematically
beautiful formulation, because in a sense quantum mechanics is the one category case,
quantum field theory is the n category case, and then the hope would be that quantum gravity is some
infinity category case, right? Right, well let's go through that claim. So you're basically saying
quantum mechanics has this, has a specific time evolution independent of spatial gauge choices.
Right, right. And what you're saying is, although, although I claim there is another kind of gauge
choice, which is this branchial gauge choice, which we'll come to in a minute, maybe.
Right, well precisely, but, but that functor, the, the functor between those two higher categories
is the thing that maps you from a spacelot, you know, from a spacetime gauge choice to a
branchial gauge choice. I see, that's your point. Okay, all right. So that's my point.
Okay, so let's, let's, so what you're saying is, in the, I say it's kind of nice, but the,
so, so on the one side, we have a bunch of these co-borderisms between these different layers in
this causal graph type thing. Right. And then, then we've got, and we've got either one seek,
one finish, which means one co-dimension one sequence of these space like hypersurfaces,
that corresponds to a particular evolution. And that's, that's, it sounds classical, but it's
actually a quantum, a particular quantum evolution. Right. Right. Okay. So another possibility is that
we pick different choices for those, for that foliage, we can pick an infinite number of different
choices of that foliage. The mapping between filiations is a, is, is a, is a gauge choice mapping.
And that's, you know, that's, that's making gauge changes. And those correspond to a different
kind of morph, a different, I guess, what is that? That's, that's again, that's a, that's a,
is that another function? Is that just a, no, that's, that's a higher morphism.
Right. Okay. It's a higher morphism. So it's a morphism between morphisms. So, plus, yeah. So
in the multi-way picture, right, you could imagine, you've got some multi-way system,
each path is, is a different gauge choice. But you could also imagine,
in, you know, rather than just like, sort of somehow imposing from the outside that, you know,
you pop from this path to the other to, to make a gauge choice, you could imagine having an explicit
rule that lets you map from one path to another. And those are, those are effectively higher morphisms.
So in mathematics, those are proof to proof transformations, which is something that
you were working on, but I think more work needs to be done on.
Yeah, no, absolutely. But, but I mean, so for the case of multi-way systems, the work that,
well, particularly Xerxes has done, but also myself and Hatem have kind of helped out a little bit
with, is, you know, essentially looking at that question, how do you define higher morphisms,
higher homotopes and so on, in kind of arbitrary, in arbitrary multi-way systems. And so in the,
yeah, in the field theory case, those higher morphisms have a pretty tangible interpretation
as essentially gauge choices, right? Right. So just, just, or gauge transformation, sorry.
The, I mean, you know, proof to proof transformations as things like you have one
proof, can you find a simpler proof? Can you, can you simplify that proof? That's, that's a,
which is a concept, a sort of higher level symbolic map, you know, symbolic computation
concept, rather than just, can you simplify this algebraic answer? Can you simplify the proof that
led to this algebraic answer? Anyway, so, okay, so we've got, on the one hand, we've got these,
these higher morphisms, and you say that we are mapping those higher morphisms to higher
morphisms on the S-matrix side, which correspond to different cuts in, in the, oh boy, this is,
the, you know, there used to be these things, this is fine, but there's the sense called these
Kutkowski, Kutkowski, Kutkowski rules, I think, which are in fact probably the same as cuts
in the, in, in, in, in proof theory, which is just really ironic. You know, one of them is just
named after a person. And, okay, in any case, so the idea is you've got a Feynman diagram that
represents all of these different possible, and, and when you, you can say, I've got the beginning
of my S-matrix, is one part of the Feynman diagram, I've got the end of the S-matrix,
another part of the Feynman diagram, and I can make an arbitrary slice between those two. I've
got a bunch of loose electrons and photons and things going through, and I can decide to make
that cut after the, you know, after the electron and positron annihilate or before, and those are
different possible choices of essentially sort of, what the heck are those called? In Feynman diagrams,
those are the, that, that kind of factoring, boy, that was studied in QCD back in the day.
Yeah, okay, that is, it's clear what that means. You have a Feynman diagram, and you can slice it
at some point, and then, you know, as you knit those things together, you have a bunch of complicated
integrals to actually evaluate the Feynman diagram, but it's clear you can, you can conceptually
sort of slice it in that way. Okay, so, so what, so now what happens? Right, I mean, yeah, and so,
as I say, if you, if you restrict only effectively to the gauge choices that correspond to Lorentz
boosts, then you get some N-categor, you get some restricted kind of N-category, and that
models quantum field theory, at least that would be the claim. But then if you, yeah, okay, so you're
saying, you're saying on the, on the, if you restrict the gauge choices that you're making on
the co-borderism thing, to only what Lorentz transformation is you're saying? Well, or Poincaré
transformation, you know. All right, as opposed to general authoristic general differing morphisms.
Right, exactly, exactly. So, so effectively, you, yeah, you've got one class of high morphisms
that's just modding out by the Poincaré group, or some connected component to the Poincaré group,
and you've got another that's modding out by the full conformal group, or the full differing
morphism group of spacetime. So, QFT corresponds to the former case, which is a restriction of
the latter, and the claim would be that full quantum gravity would correspond to the latter case.
In the case where you just described, where you just have Lorentz transformations,
you're saying you just sold me this thing about Feynman diagrams, or I sold myself
about Feynman diagrams, and that, but in that case, the slicing of the Feynman diagrams,
in the case of general differing morphism, what, oh, I see. It's just, you can stretch it topologically,
any topological transformation of the Feynman diagram is permitted, whereas, you know,
the ordinary transformation is you can just, you are only allowed to affect.
I think it's more complicated than that, because I think the particle states change.
In other words, I mean, what happens when you go into, you know, non-trivial spacetime is this
notion of particle states, which was just, you know, the electron, where the electron propagator,
the electron propagator changes, because you're redefining, you know, you're redefining the
particle states, you're redefining, you know, even in a boosted, even in an accelerated frame,
you're redefining particle states. So, how does that, I mean, and, you know, there isn't really
a good generalization that I'm aware of, of, I mean, you can do, I mean, like the original
Hawking effect is associated with doing Feynman diagrams, basically, very simple Feynman diagrams,
where the propagators are in a curved spacetime. Right, right. But the, yeah, I mean,
QFT in curved spacetime is pretty well solved, except for the back reaction, right?
Which is otherwise known as the effect of gravity on a proofing, which is
otherwise known as the main story of quantum gravity. Right, of course, I mean, this, yeah.
Right, but so what you're saying is, I see, so maybe the point is that you're saying that
there also have to be graviton lines in Feynman diagrams, and then the traditional stuff all
goes to help, because, I mean, the back reaction, in a Feynman diagram, back reaction has to be
represented by the effects of gravity on other particles, which is otherwise known as graviton,
you know, right, graviton lines. Okay, but so, all right, so we've understood a little bit about
the correspondence. You were going to make some other points about this correspondence between,
between, I mean, this, actually, I have a question about the correspondence to quantum,
to ordinary quantum field theory from this, from this multivariate graph there. So one,
one important question, one important practical question is, can we find a better way to do numerical
quantum field theory? Because numerical quantum field theory, the only way that's known right now
is last gauge theory, that is gauge theory requires this rotation to be put in space,
that's a big mess. Right. And so the question is, would this correspondence between the
multivariate graph on the one hand, and Feynman diagrams, S matrices on the other hand,
one might think that one could use that to use the pure multivariate graph as a way to do, you
know, computations, do we know if that works? I don't think we know if that works. I mean,
one way that you could do, okay, certainly one way you could do relativistic quantum mechanics,
which takes you most of the way there would be, so if you've got a multivariate evolution graph,
right, that's the kind of model of a monoidal one category, if you then add in the causal edges,
so you get a multivariate causal graph, evolution causal graph, I should say, that's
effectively a weak form of two category. And in a sense, so relativistic, so whereas we know how
to pretty much know how to do ordinary quantum mechanics over, you know, over sort of over the
one category, over the multivariate system, if we could do an analogous thing for that weak two
category for multivariate evolution causal graphs, that would be that presumably correspond to
relativistic quantum mechanics. How would we see that? So I mean, let's say, how would we get like
the Dirac equation out of that? I mean, how would we see the difference between getting the Schrodinger
equation and getting the Dirac equation? Well, so we know, okay, as we discussed the other day,
there's a there's a sort of standard way you can get something like the Klein-Gordon equation in a
causal graph, right, or in a multivariate causal graph. What you were saying by putting weights
on the causal graph? Yes, but also, I mean, that's one way you can get it. You can also,
I mean, that's essentially, that's one of the approaches that's developed in causal set theory,
right, because you define it, you take it, you define it to Lambert operator by essentially
equipping the causal set with a bunch of, you know, every element is associated with some
scale of value, and then you just sum over causal layers. But you could also think of the causal
graph as intrinsically defining a differential operator, which is just for people's benefit.
I mean, so the issue is, you know, normally a causal graph is just a thing with nodes,
but you can always put values on those nodes, and then the thing becomes more like a partial
differential, you know, more like a, we should call it a finite graph as opposed to finite elements,
a finite graph approximation to a partial differential equation.
So, in that finite graph approximation, one would eventually, the point that I was making is that
there's a limit that, in which that finite graph approximation limits to a kind of equation,
to the massive, massive or massless? I believe the massless is the, I may be wrong on this,
I believe the massless case is the only one where it's known. There is an ansatz for the
massive form, I don't know if that's been proven to be correct. Okay, I mean, in a sense, this is
going to be obvious because this is essentially a form of the wave equation. Right, right. Which is,
and it works on the causal graph because the characteristic lines of the wave equation are
just this criss-cross thing, I think. Right, right. Anyway, so what one would expect, I
assume, is if you did the associated thing on the multi-way evolution causal graph, so now you've
got two classes of edges, you've got causal and evolution, then some mixture of the Schrodinger
operator and the Klein-Gordon operator would give you a Dirac operator on this structure.
Of course, with the Dirac operator, we need, you know, to spend a half, which we don't yet
understand. Right, right. But that might be some square root of some, I mean, that would be very
nice. In fact, that's a good point that just as, if it is true, if it is true that the
Klein-Gordon operator comes by having these sort of criss-crossing diamonds in the multi-way graph.
Right, then commutation of your field operators that gives you spin zero, for instance,
is essentially merging of branch pairs in the multi-way system. Right, that means the Dirac
operator, which is the square root of that, would naturally be a single branch, which is what we
guessed ages ago. Just curious. The correspondence between fermions and bosons. So that would be,
so that's actually worth working out, whether that, because that would mean that
in a very literal sense, the Dirac, you know, fermions and square root of bosons,
because they are the things that come from single branches in the multi-way graph.
Right. Okay, so how many more things can we solve here? That's a good piece. So, okay, but
let's see, you were, I think you still had to explain this functorial one of your theory,
which you'd explained as being this notion of this cowardism. Right, right. And then you were
going to explain maybe also algebraic quantity. Right, so the point is that in addition to associating
a space of states, you could also, to each hypersurface, you could also associate an
endomorphism algebra, right? You could also associate some algebra of observables.
Right, and that's not so obvious how that actually works to me. I mean, that is, that is,
you've got this, so the algebra of observables, as I was sort of yacking before about correlation
functions, I don't really understand. Given a graph, I mean, the algebra, I don't see this,
because I mean, the unitary evolution, I clearly understand, it's just you go, you follow the
edges, you go from this to this to this. Right, right. In the case of observables,
is the algebra of observables, is it something as simple as you're looking at the relationship
of edges and the branch of graph or something? Right, well, exactly, I mean, so, okay,
exactly correlation. Right, right, right. And the reason they correspond to endomorphisms is
because they're the things along which you can complete, right? So if you want to perform
observations, those are the observations you are able to perform.
I think that's right. But notably, the point is, and I was wondering about this, I mean,
there's this statistical mechanics, there's cluster expansions of things. And I wonder,
I wondered this, because I wondered this in connection with Matt's project about,
from whenever it was. 2020. Yeah, right, about hard sphere gases, because I wondered whether
there was a, what the interpretation of the branch of graph, and I guess that the interpretation
of the branch of graph is one of these cluster expansions. And that's sounding more convincing.
Okay, so anyway, so what you're saying is the branch of graph represents, maybe the branch
of graph represents the collection of correlation functions is essentially an encoding just like
it's an entangled map. It's also a correlation function map. Right. And, okay, so then, then,
so, you know, because in effect, each state is some eigenstate, right? And then, and then
every branch of it, one way you can think about it is it's one possible projection that you can
perform of an eigenstate onto another. Yeah, which is otherwise known as a central correlation.
Right, no, I'm agreeing. That's nice. Okay. All right, so anyway, so we've now,
we've got this endomorphism, whatever, endomorphism collection of endomorphisms between operators.
Right. Okay. So, which is otherwise known as a branch of graph, branch of graph.
Right, right. And so, so the, you know, the original white man axioms for axiomatic
quantum field theory and the more modern kind of hog, I think more modern, not particularly modern,
but the slightly more refined version of the hard Kessler axioms for algebraic QFT,
those are effectively describing the same field theory, but at the level of the endomorphism
algebras and their isomorphisms, rather than the level of the vector spaces of states,
and their linear transformations. And so, the statement that these two pictures are dual,
that Schrodinger and Heisenberg are dual, is stating that effectively the multi-way
evolution graph and the sequence of branch of graphs are encoding the same multi-way evolution.
And that one can be reconstructed from the other. Right, right.
In the AQFT, just a modern question, does the A stand for axiomatic or algebraic?
Algebraic, because both are axiomatic, right? Both FQFT and AQFT are axiomatic field theories,
there are just two perspectives on it. But the hard axioms were not stated in terms of
observables originally. No. Stated in terms of asymptotic states and field operations.
Right, right. The hard Kessler formulation is a modern refinement, but although, as we discussed
the other day, there is a, there is a pretty direct way of obtaining the statements about
asymptotic states from, from those axioms, you know, from the, from the modern formulation.
The branch of surface evolution versus path evolution duality. I guess we are considering
equivalence classes of multi-way systems up to renaming the single states, right? Because the
the only way we can say they are describing the same process is structurally, right?
Right. Yes, that's true. Yes, but so, so, okay, so, so what's the conclusion? The conclusion is
that there's this nice correspondence between branchial evolution and, and temporal evolution,
basically. Right, right. And so, I mean, one of the exciting things is that, so, as I say, this,
the reason I got interested in this was actually not so much because I was interested in field
theory, although that's obviously interesting in its own right, but more because this seemed to be
the case of this, you know, I think what we can now reasonably think of is this functorial
transformation between multi-way vibrations and multi-way foliations. There's, there's,
this was the case where that functorial relationship seemed to have been explored to the greatest
depth, because for instance, in some of the work of O's Schreiber and other people who are doing
kind of higher gauge theory stuff, there is a very concrete construction of this functor that takes you
from endomorphism algebras and their isomorphisms to vector spaces and their isomorphisms.
So, okay, just, just, we should probably, that's, I've gone for ages and ages, but,
I mean, let's just zoom out from there. Okay, so we've got this categorical, this correspondence
that between, I mean, this is, what's interesting about this is, this is the same
story as ADS, CFT, it's the same thing as, you know, AF, AQFT versus FQFT, it's the same thing as
Heisenberg versus Schrodinger. These are just, this is just some sort of fundamental duality
that exists across lots of kinds of systems. Right. So the, what else can we figure out?
And it's also the thing between multi-theorem theory. Right, right, I think so. And these are all,
all equivalent dualities. So what other dualities might that be like that?
Well, I mean, this is actually something I wanted to ask you about, because in a sense, so
we, I think both of us for various reasons are getting interested in this question of,
you know, how can these multi-way, you know, how can the formalism of multi-computation,
for instance, be applied to chemical reaction networks or, you know, ecological systems in
biology and so on. And in those situations, I think a lot of those correspondence, I mean,
presumably if multi-way systems are a good model, then those dualities should also exist,
but I don't think we know their interpretation in those kinds of areas.
Right. I think the Branschel graph, I mean, the story in chemistry, for example,
the story of the Branschel graph.
It's just what ambient chemicals are around in a particular moment of time, right? That's the...
Yeah. I mean, the story of causal graphs is the thing which is less clear in chemistry. I mean,
chemistry, people don't talk so much about causal graphs. They talk nearly about what chemical,
you know, they talk about chemicals making chemicals. They don't talk about the causation
of one reaction, having an effect on another reaction.
Right. Although, I mean, again, as I think I mentioned the other day, it's like in a very
minimal case of this, you could just say... So, you know, imagine you have a multi-way system that
is just encoding stoichiometry, right? So, you just know populations of certain chemical species,
but you don't know anything. There's no other kind of reactivity rules encoded.
They're just interacting in ways that sort of algebraically permitted. Well, if you start from
the assumption that everything's a kind of uniform pressure and temperature and so on,
then in a sense, the causal structure of that stoichiometric multi-way system
is telling you about the energies of particular chemical species, right? How many previous times
of these things interact? You know, how many times is this thing bounced off that thing?
How many times are these things interacted? And so then you can start to develop a pretty
minimal model of something like activation kinetics just in terms of causal structure.
That's a place where, I think, even in conventional chemistry, there is...
Well, I mean, because of every reaction, there's a change of energy, and you're saying the causal
graph is measuring the change of... You can do energy bookkeeping using causal structure even,
you know, even in a multi-way system where there's no information about that.
It's sort of a shame, though, that in the world of correspondences that the... Or maybe it isn't...
Maybe... Gosh, that would be terrible. The density of causal edges, which in physics
corresponds to energy density, is also energy density in chemistry.
Right. But at a completely different scale.
Yes, a completely different scale. It sounds like in this interpretation that is what's being said.
Well, I mean, so actually, again, I'm going to necessarily be a bit more speculative because
these are areas I don't really know anything about. But so, you know, one thing I've become
interested in recently is, so for instance, when you're looking at... When you're modeling
either chemical reaction networks or biological systems as multi-way systems, you know, there is
a very multi-way-like approach that's already been adopted in kind of mathematical formalizations of
these things, which is PetriNets. And we know, as we know, PetriNets are effectively token event
graph. I would argue more precisely, they are their local multi-way systems in which the token,
you know, the PetriNet tokens are tokens, and the transition firings are event firings in some
global multi-way system. Although PetriNets have de-duplicated all... I mean, a minimal...
Well... A ordinary PetriNet de-duplicated the tokens.
Right, right. But not in, for instance, the colored case that Paul is interested in.
Or, I mean, there are other... There are things like whole grain PetriNets and
SigmaNets and so on, which have a slightly more sophisticated semantics.
I wonder for years what the second matter is.
I'm not sure I can reasonably explain it.
I was talking 100, but eventually it might show up.
Or at least not in a reasonable timeframe. But no, I mean, they're effectively like PetriNets,
but with a different de-duplification semantics and a different execution semantics. That's
the basic idea. But the point I was making was, okay, so in kind of very... If you take something like
either chemical reactions or ecology, you know, ecology, it's pretty standard in very minimal
mathematical models to use essentially a kind of mass activation law. That's effectively what
things like the logical Volterra equations do. That's what the... That's what the
exponential growth model does, et cetera. But we know that that's a bad model for things like
macromolecules and chemistry for things like enzymes. We also know it's a bad model for
population species. Because, for instance, in predator prey models, you get predator satiation
and that kind of stuff. And so... Wait, wait, wait. You're saying, I mean, PetriNets were originally
invented by Carl Adam Petri as a... He was a high school kid as a way of modern chemical reactions.
That's the... And... I'm not even sure. Was he... Was he... He was like... Was he younger than that?
He was 13 or eight, or some ridiculously early age. Was he in high school by that point?
I think I might have been middle school. Maybe middle school. I don't know, depending on the
German divisions between... I don't know whether they happened. It's very... I mean, it must be
strange to have the really the only thing that you're known for. You know, he has some long
distinguished academic career and the only thing he's really known for is this thing he invented
when he was like 13. Well, it turns out, I was reading, you know, he has an autobiography. And
it turns out I had thought that, you know, and also I exchanged some letters with him, actually,
which were quite odd. And so I was really kind of confused about what this whole story was.
But the fact is that this thing he invented early, you know, he went through and as computer
systems became important, he kind of applied Petri Nets to computer systems and that became
the whole story. Right. Chemistry application of Petri Nets kind of fell away very quickly.
Right. But now the chemistry applications back, because the Petri Nets, you know, says you have
these tokens, they accumulate, so to speak, and then you can have a firing, a thing that happens,
an event that happens, that is like, you have to have, you know, I know nothing about chemistry,
you have to have two hydrogens and an oxygen or something, and then you can make water.
Right. You need both of those tokens, you know, all of those tokens to have the event of making
water, so to speak. Right, right. Anyway, so the point I was making, yeah, I mean, there's a pretty
standard approach to setting up that formalism in chemistry where you essentially say, you know,
we've got some, we've got some set of chemical species, you've got some function that maps that's
that set of species to the natural numbers that tells you essentially, like, how many of such
and such a molecule is there, you construct some, some directed graph that where every vertex is labeled
by, you know, by a function, by what's called the chemical complex, which is that function.
And then there's, yeah, there's a direct way of mapping those graphs onto Petri Nets and back again.
But the point I was making was, so, you know, ordinarily rate laws are not encoded in Petri
Nets, right? That's something you have to encode subsequently. You have to place some kind of
weighting on each edge. And similarly, I mean, that's kind of true with the multi-way system,
right? You can use the kind of trivial, when you, you know, when you construct a multi-way
semantics for these Petri Nets, you can use the kind of trivial path weighting. But you could
also imagine having a multi-way system where there's, where there's a different kind of function
that tells you about what the pathways should be. And that's really the same as what's going on with
rate laws. The point I was making, though, is that so, you know, the, in traditional mathematical
models, we've used pretty terrible rate laws, you know, things like logical Volterra used essentially
these mass laws that assume that, you know, right, right, which is kind of, which is kind
of assuming that biological species act like, you know, idealized gas molecules or something,
where there's, you know, but, but what you want is, you know, for instance, there's,
is it called the my, I should remember this name. It's like the mykylus, uh, Merton model. There's
some trivial modification you can make to the mass law that's used in, that's like the most popular
model of enzyme kinetics. That's like a kind of satiation version of that, which can also be
applied to population dynamics to model predecessor satiation. Oh, no, I mean, it's, it's just a mass
activation law, but with like a denominator that kind of induces a decay effectively.
Anyway, so the, the point I'm making, though, is that my suspicion, which I have some
technical, you know, I have some formal evidence for, but it would be nice to get more,
is that, is that in general, those kinds of, those different activation models
effectively correspond to different functions that you can apply to the causal structure
of the associated global multiway system. So for instance, you know, statements about
thermodynamic equilibrium and chemistry, I suspect effectively correspond to statements
about causal cyclicity in the, you know, when you, when you equip the global multiway system
with some causal semantics, if it becomes possible, you know, thermodynamic equilibrium is equivalent
to the statement that there's, you know, that your chemical reaction kind of go in both directions
with, with equal, you know, with, with, with some kind of, yeah.
Well, let's see.
And then, go ahead.
And then yes. And then, and then so things like the, the activation kinetics that I was talking
about earlier in relation to like a stoichiometric multiway system, that would be again a very
simple kind of use of the causal structure where you're just using causal edges to essentially
book keep information about energy. But one could imagine defining kind of arbitrarily
sophisticated functions over the causal structure that would correspond to presumably
different kind of activation models, different energetic models.
Well, I mean, look, in general, the plain multiway graph, I mean, it's, it's kind of reminiscent of,
you know, the sort of capacity and information theory versus Shannon information and so on.
It's the unweighted, it's the what can happen versus with what weighted happens.
Right.
And in our traditional multiway graphs, there is no weighting except pathway to.
Right.
And so what you're saying is, you could, in effect, what I'm, okay, very concretely what
I'm trying to say is that you could imagine in the multiway system specification,
there being another kind of function that, that selects pathways based on information
about the causal history of that path.
Yes.
Well, let's think about that for a second.
So I mean, the most naive thing is you've got a node in the multiway graph that has
certain pathways coming into it.
And you could imagine one thing you could do is you could take, take the outgoing pathway to
some function of the incoming pathways, just at the pure multivariate level,
getting anything about causal stuff.
Yeah.
And then you could ask, you could equally well have in the causal graph, you could also have
this kind of weighting theory where a particular event, if it is caused by a couple of other events,
has some weighting, some path weighting of its outgoing edge that is some function of the
pathways of the incoming edges.
Right.
Right.
And to the, and the point I'm making with, in relation to those different models of kind of
rate laws and like, like the Michaelis, Merton model is, you know, if you want to model something
like predator satiation, then what does that work?
What satiation?
Oh, satiation.
Satiation.
It doesn't, it doesn't even talk.
You're, you're, you're one of the few people I expect to be able to understand my accent.
Why are we having this communication problem?
Satiation.
But no, so, you know, if you just have the pure multi-way structure, it's hard to encode that.
Whereas, you know, what you want to be able to do is say effectively, if this, you know, if this
lion has eaten 20 gazelles in the last day, it probably doesn't want to eat another gazelle.
And that's really a statement about causal history.
And so, you know, my kind of, and my abstract statement is that these different activation
models are just different functions you can apply to the causal history of paths.
Right.
Right.
But, but I mean, I'm not sure that that's the, I mean, that saturation idea is not,
not sure that's the most important idea, but maybe it is.
No, but it's one example of where, because in effect, if you just have a multi-way system
that's doing ordinary, something like ordinary petri net semantics, just, you know,
just transitions fire when they can fire.
That's just like the mass law.
Right.
And so, so I'm saying, if you, if you want to have more realistic rate laws,
Mads, and who is an actual chemist has a.
My question is some functions, connecting some species with some other species.
Is it like a function that tells you, you know, start with some chemical that will
end up with some other chemicals?
What are, can you clarify more, what do you mean by those functions?
What are those functions?
Right.
Okay.
So, so we got, we've got two different levels of stuff going on here.
Right.
So, so in terms of just the ordinary multi-way semantics or the ordinary petri net semantics,
yeah, exactly.
It's, so you've got, I mean, it's coming, it's going back to like the, the statement
about axioms and free structures, right?
In a sense, the free algebraic structure of chemistry is stoichiometry, right?
Where you just, things have to balance.
And so, so in that case, every token in your global multi-way system or in your petri
net is labeled with some chemical species.
And then, and then there are, there are just simple rules that are imposed axiomatically
that say that transitions can fire as long as they preserve the numbers of those chemical
species.
You can then define a more sophisticated function that restricts that more
based on, yeah, exactly as you say, some statement of the form, these things can come
in, these things can go out, but, you know, but this class of chemical reaction is not
permitted for some other reason.
Then the point that I'm making is, well, you can have situations where, you know,
chemical reactions are only, the transitions can fire only in certain situations where
those situations are not just a question of, you know, do we have the requisite tokens?
But for instance, is, do we have the right temperature?
Is the right, is that, you know, do we have the right energy conditions?
And my speculative claim is that in general, those activation conditions can be encoded as
questions, essentially queries of the causal history of those tokens, right?
If you, if you can know how many other tokens is that token interacted with, how many other
things is it bounced off, you know, what is its complete causal ancestry, then my, my
conjecture would be that gives you all the information you need to be able to, to, to
encode kind of arbitrary activation conditions.
Sorry, more than that.
I mean, in other words, the actual, actual models will not need to know the complete
history of all meals of the land.
Right, right.
It would be some coarse-grained thing.
John, sorry.
Just to, to, to, to increase that, that last point that you made.
You're saying that the sort of coarse-grained thermodynamic variables can be read off as
a causal history of the individual events, is that the claim?
I think that's the idea.
I mean, and we see that in, for instance, as you say, in maths projects, right?
Where you can infer essentially temperature, when you've got causal graphs generated by
hard-sphere gas collisions, you can read off things like temperature just from causal structure.
And if that's a more general principle, which I think we think we believe it is, then.
Right, so then we have to figure out what's the angle of the boosts and reference frames
and event horizons and so on.
We know some of those things for chemistry.
But, yeah.
Well, you know, coarse-graining, but it's very basic, obviously, a statistical mechanics,
but not the whole presentation process.
So what is the true definition, like, you know, when that transition happens?
We are, we are talking about coarse-graining in a much more abstracted, yeah.
But the level, what do you mean by coarse-graining?
It's a general concept.
I mean, coarse-graining and statistical mechanics is part of this observer theory story.
That is, you know, the molecules bounce around as the molecules bounce around,
but we observe only certain aspects of what's happening with these molecules.
One of the key observations back from MKS times is that the reason the second law of thermodynamics
works is because the only coarse-graining we can do are computationally bounded coarse-graining.
And the underlying system is generating computationally irreducible behavior.
And that's why we believe in the second law of thermodynamics.
So, by the way, I mean, in terms of history of statistical mechanics,
the history of statistical mechanics is, you know, Boltzmann originally had this idea of
entropy and all this kind of stuff, but then there's this kind of bug
that you really have to do coarse-grained entropy.
Otherwise, it's always entropy zero because it's a unique state.
And the question is, what's about coarse-graining, you know, Gibbs in the 1920s, 1930s,
kind of terrified this notion of coarse-graining,
but not how you would do coarse-graining.
And so I think the thing that I understood in the 1990s was this fact that, you know,
you can think about coarse-graining as a computational process.
And when you think about that, you actually can nail down what is a valid coarse-graining.
Nobody had been able to do that before.
This idea of what is a valid coarse-graining in the books of, you know,
my favorite is a book about statistical physics,
which proves Boltzmann's H theorem, the theorem that entropy increases with time,
which is based on some statistical argument about my calculations.
And it says, at the end of that, at the end of the section, it says,
you know, it proves that the H decreases entropy increases with time.
And it says, but you can run this whole derivation in reverse,
which means that entropy would decrease with time.
The last sentence is, this point is often puzzling to the student.
It's been puzzling to everybody.
It was puzzling to everybody from Boltzmann on.
I think that that's finally resolved by thinking about this computational boundary
of this observer's story.
And it's, I mean, and by the way, the reason you can do those proofs both way around,
both ways around, just a statistical mechanics fact is that in the proof,
you assume that molecules are uncorrelated before they collide.
But the fact that they're uncorrelated before they collide,
once they've collided necessarily, they're correlated because they just had a collision.
And that's probably not unrelated to things that we have to think about for chemistry.
Right.
I mean, and some of this is not figured out.
And by the way, when we talk about entropy and entanglement entropy and all these kinds of things,
it's all, there are all kinds of issues that come up about what kind of coarse-graining we're dealing
with what, when you talk about entanglement entropy, it's like, what is the set of things
that you are constraining to say that you're talking about?
And then how many states are consistent with that?
I mean, so in the context of multi-computation, or at least in the stuff that I'm talking about
in relation to global multi-way systems, coarse-graining has a very precise meaning,
which is just that it's the state equivalence function that you use.
Right.
So, you know, in ordinary multi-way systems, you could imagine, if you're doing
graph rewriting, you could imagine treating every pair of graphs where same Q returns
false as being distinct.
But for most cases where you want to do graph rewriting,
that's not particularly useful.
You want to merge based on a coarser criterion, which is graph isomorphism.
Right.
And so your state equivalence function is not same Q, it's isomorphic graph Q.
And so those are two rather trivial examples of essentially coarse-graining functions.
And the point with the observer theory is that one's defining a much stricter and therefore
much coarser potential class of coarse-graining, because we don't expect physically realistic
observers to be able to do actual isomorphism distinction.
They're distinguishing something that's much coarser, that's more like at the level of
thermodynamic variables.
I have a question, one comment.
The question is why is this concept that reversing the process would increase the
because we know, for example, parts of the equation are good equations, like
or we can keep the heat equation that time reversal is not equivalent to the entropy.
The heat equation is at a higher level.
The heat equation.
Yeah, the heat equation is a parabolic equation.
It is at a higher level of description.
I mean, this is at the level of molecular dynamics where every molecular collision is
reversible.
And so what the H theorem is doing is trying to say, based on just looking at a collection
of reversible collisions, what is the conclusion for the entropy as measured in terms of the
number of states consistent with the system.
By the time you're at the heat equation, you've already got, you've already assumed the answer.
But even in the state of course, when the system
improves in some time of uncertainty, we build approach to the range level.
That's even a perfect solution.
Yeah, but that argument, we're off topic here.
That argument goes, we'll self-destruct because you end up with, as soon as you're talking about,
you're making assumptions about the range of initial states.
And that's going to end up being something which is essentially about state preparation.
It's a little bit different.
Course screening affects state preparation, as well as state observation.
And what you're saying there is, it's just like state preparation version of the
problem of the second row of thermodynamics is, is there a way that we can arrange the
molecules of gas in this row?
So that they'll all go to one corner in a minute, right?
And, you know, we argue we can't do that.
And it's the same statement as the, what's that?
I think that's not the main point.
The main point is, do the computation, you know, actually do the computation to figure
out how to get those molecules to arrange themselves so that they will go to that corner.
That's irreducibly difficult.
And by the way, if you succeed in doing that, you're going to be able to do that.
Irreducibly difficult.
And by the way, if you succeed in doing that, go down to the level of the atoms of space
and figure out how they're going to arrange themselves.
And then you can travel faster than light.
I do think, okay, I do think Soteris raises an interesting point though, right?
Which is so, I mean, to rehash the kind of NKS explanation, which I know is, you know,
itself a kind of rehashing of earlier stuff that you've done on statistical
properties of CAs and things.
But, you know, so if one views second law of thermodynamics as being essentially a cryptographic
or cryptanalytic statement, right, that essentially, even if you have perfect
reversibility, because of computational irreducibility, the action of the system
can effectively encrypt details of the initial conditions to an arbitrary extent.
Therefore, turning that on its head, if you as an observer are computationally bounded,
then you're only ever going to be able to talk about equivalence classes of initial
conditions and equivalence classes of, you know, possible evolutions and so on,
which is the course-graining point.
So, Soteris, do you then bring up the point about, well, what if your course-graining themselves
have an element of uncertainty to them?
Which is, I think, a kind of meta version of the observer theory question, which is,
the observer is computationally bounded, but they don't know how computationally
bounded they are.
What conclusions can they draw?
Which I think is quite an interesting question.
Okay, yeah, that's a reasonable question.
I mean, right, maybe we've almost exhausted the set of things we can talk about here.
Is there any other, I mean, another thing that I'm, I mean, wouldn't you prefer to wrap up
or continue this another time?
I have one other thing, one other weird comment I want to make about chemistry,
in case that's very reasonable, which is, so one thing that, one place where I think
weirdly there's a very direct connection to some very abstract pieces of mathematical physics
is, so this issue, this question about chemistry and reactions between species and so on
turns out to be very, very mathematically similar to the question of d-brains in
b-mode topological string theories, which is something I don't understand the physics of
in any sense, but mathematically what's going on is, you've got, you know, these
d-brain things, which are just objects in some triangulated derived category,
and they can affect-
Where did the category come from, the things in string theory?
Right, right, as I say, I don't know what they correspond to in string theory.
I'm also not entirely convinced that string theorists know what they correspond to in
string theory, but they, you know, as I say, mathematically you can treat them as objects
in this category that's effectively like a, well, it's a triangulated category, which means
it's kind of, you take some infinity category and you kind of collapse it down to a one category
in a way that you have some nice properties of the homotopy fibers, but-
It's just, my understanding is a string is this, you know, one-dimensional thing that
traces out a world sheet over time, and string theory is the story of, you know,
is variational principles on that world sheet.
Right, right, and to the point is in a topological string theory that we're back to the functorial
QFT case, right? The initial and final strings are your, are like the initial and final states in
the FQFT, and the world sheet is the co-borders in relation between them.
So again, they naturally define some category.
So now in the d-brain case, what's happening is instead of this one-dimensional string,
you've got some high-dimensional brain.
Yeah, high-dimensional brain.
And so all that's happening is that you're looking at this, you know, relation, which is,
as you're describing, co-orders of relation between the initial d-brain and the final d-brain.
Exactly.
And okay.
Yeah, so they form objects in this, yeah, in this triangulation.
In all these categories.
It's it's co-orders between these d-brains.
But anyway, so these d-brains can merge and they can split in various ways, right?
And so in particular, so they can merge into effectively something like a direct sum of d-brains,
but it's a direct sum with interaction that's kind of a bit like a semi-direct product.
Like a string field theory.
Yeah.
Like you're having, the whole point of string field theory is that you have all these different
ways in which the strings can split and join.
You have this, instead of having this, you know, plain surface that is the world sheet,
you have this thing with all kinds of holes in it and so on.
Right.
And I assume there's a topological version of that, which I don't really understand,
which is a topological quantum field theory related to string theory.
Exactly.
Well, that's what topological string theory is.
Oh, okay.
So, and so, yeah, anyway, so then there are specific, and okay, mathematically those,
you know, if you've got, you know, d-brain A and it splits into a sort of direct sum with
interaction of d-brains B and C, mathematically in the derived triangulated category,
although that corresponds to a homotopy, essentially a homotopy fiber sequence of
B to A to C. And so, then there's a set of purely mathematical principles,
which I think are called the bridgeland conditions on that category, that tell you
effectively what, you know, what, which reactions are not permissible, right, you know,
in which situations will you get using, in which situations will you get splitting,
etc. And you can associate various different triangulated categories with different sets
of bridgeland conditions. And formally, it looks very, very similar to essentially this
description of like, you know, what chemical, what reactions between chemical species are
and are not permitted. And if that's true, that's quite interesting because now,
suddenly a lot of that, you know, the mathematical apparatus that we were talking about earlier
that comes a lot of it from topological field theory, where you can actually talk quite explicitly
about this duality between multiway fibers and foliations, you can now wheel that in and
essentially solve a whole bunch of or translate a whole bunch of these concepts in chemistry
to the same formalism. So there's a weird kind of, I don't know, I have this, you know, I think,
you know, Feynman diagrams are also not completely unlike chemistry. But what you're,
what you're dealing with here is something which where, you know, the in string field theory,
you could imagine a Feynman diagram like representation of string field theory.
Right, right. And so this is, this is something, although it is a little bit more complicated
because in, you know, in Feynman diagrams are a story of particles. And these things are a story
of more general objects that aren't just localized things moving one dimensionally through time.
Right. And so that's a more, you know, so that's a generalization of that. Now, whether, whether
in chemistry, there's, it's a meaningful thing to have these more extended objects in, in, in
in space time, I mean, I would imagine a molecular biology, it might be. A molecular biology might,
you know, it could be that a molecular biology, I mean, it matters that molecules are big in
molecular biology. But as most of the time in ordinary chemistry, gas phase chemistry, for example,
it doesn't matter how big the molecules are, they just, you know, molecules just float around
freely and never so often they collide. The collision frequency is comparatively low. The
the inter in solid state chemistry, you know, they're just locked in place and they only know
that the liquid state is the reason that that's why, you know, that's why the, you know, the
airport security people are concerned about people bringing large amounts of liquid. That's why
coming through reactions happen in a significant way, because there's enough density to have
significant chemical reactions and not some. And so, so the liquid state case is, let's see,
what was I going to say? I lost my train of thought.
I have a person on the boat, given this new paradigm to do science,
what are the potential physical phenomena or physical systems that we might be able to see
a clear distinction between conventional science and this new paradigm of your scientific
project. Do you think that in your future you play an experiment and one can say,
you know, this is the new thing that this approach that is not explained at all by the
conventional science. I mean, look, the most, the most immediately applicable one will be a
formalism for practical multi-competition. That is, you know, distributed computing,
which has been hard, that hopefully this formalism will give us a way to think about that,
that makes it much easier to understand and much more accessible to humans. I mean, then,
then there are a whole list of other areas between, you know, economics, chemistry,
molecular biology, immunology, linguistics, machine learning, neuroscience. I don't, I'm
counting my fingers, but I don't actually know the number that we've enumerated so far, but
each one of these fields for different evolutionary biology, each one of these fields
for different reasons, it looks promising that one could use this kind of multi-computation
approach and potentially derive, I mean, the main thing that's going to happen is that in the world
of computational paradigms, one's face-to-face, you know, one's face-to-face with computational
energy services limits what one can say. In the case of multi-computation plus observers,
the right kind of observer can find general laws. The only problem is what kind of observer is that?
And for example, let's say in economics, or for that matter, in chemistry or microbiology,
it could be the case that the observer that we have normally been using is one that can't find
a global law, but there is an observer that maybe some other kind of observer that measures,
you know, different kinds of things in economics or neuroscience or whatever,
that other kind of observer can find global laws. And that other kind of observer, it could be
that you just go right out and measure such and such a weird thing in economic systems and say,
my gosh, you know, the economists who've been trying to find global laws for years and everybody
thinks that, or many people think they haven't really found anything, maybe, you know, as soon
as you measure some different bizarre thing that you could measure in a virtual world, you could
measure some detailed thing about correlations between, you know, amounts of money when here
and there, suddenly boom, there'll be a global law. That's the type of thing that I think will happen.
So, okay, in relation to your question about, you know, potential experiments and things like that,
so I think it's important to make a distinction between sort of paradigms and theories,
or metamodels and theories, or however you want to formulate that. I mean, so in a sense, it's
very directly analogous to the distinction between a formal model of computation and a specific
computation, right? So, in a sense, a scientific theory is like a specific computation. It predicts
that the output of such and such a thing will be x. And if the output is not x, then your theory is
falsified. And that's kind of, so individual specific computations and classes of computations,
that's what the whole, you know, Popperian, Cuny and et cetera philosophy was kind of set up to deal
with. With something like multi-computation, or even with the original formalism of the physics
project, I don't think we were ever talking about theories at that level, right? We, this is a formal,
this is a formal model of, I mean, in a very concrete sense, multi-computation,
hypergraphoretic, all these things are formal models of computation. They are,
they are a kind of space within which you can embed theories. They are not themselves theories.
Okay, so, but there is an important, so there is a sense in which you could sort of imagine
falsifying a paradigm, but it's, it's, it's, the distinction is much less sharp than it is for,
you know, for ordinary theories. It's, because it's ultimately one of aesthetics, right? So,
in a sense, you know, what's actually happening is you've got these computations that, that are,
that correspond to your models. And you've got the computations that correspond, we think to,
you know, processes, actual processes that occur in the universe. And the problem, the basic problem
of theoretical science and observational science is to essentially define some kind of encoding
function, some intermediate computation that lets you translate between abstract computational
states of your model and concrete, you know, physical natural states of the system you're
trying to, you're trying to construct the model of. And so then the, the strength of a paradigm lies,
I would argue, in the simplicity of its encoding functions. A good paradigm is one way you can
write down encoding functions that have very minimal algorithmic or computational complexity.
And a bad one is one where the encoding functions have to be extremely convoluted and contrived.
And so in a sense, you could imagine falsifying the multi-computational paradigm if you could
find an example of some system where, yeah, of course, because of, because of universality and
so on, it's possible to, to construct some, some simulation of it if your encoding function is
allowed to be arbitrarily weird and contrived. But, you know, if it were the case that, for instance,
you know, with the physics model, you can, you know, you can reproduce general relativity,
you can reproduce quantum mechanics, you can reproduce quantum field theory very naturally,
as it appears, maybe the case. But, you know, to be able to reproduce the mass of the muon
or something, you know, you require some, some big 100,000 line program. That's, that's a sign
that that's, you know, that's, that's a, it's not a falsification, but it's a weak point of the
paradigm. And so it's, as I think, ultimately, it's, it's a, your question is one that requires
in the end a kind of aesthetic judgment rather than there's, there's no sharp
distinction, I'd say, when you're, when you're reasoning at the level of entire models of,
you know, rather than at the level of specific theories.
But it's also like the question of, you know, could calculus be wrong?
The answer is it's not, that's not the right type of question, because calculus is just this formal
setup. And, you know, calculus could be irrelevant to things in physics or things in the world,
but it can't be just wrong. So it's, I mean, that is, you know,
Right, but that comes back to the encoding function thing, right? I mean, so calculus,
as far as we can tell, is a sort of universal paradigm for doing that. You know, in principle,
you could do combinatorics with calculus. If you, you know, if you set up some weird combination
of step functions and used integrals to count things and whatever, but it would be horrible,
like no one wanted to do that. In fact, the encoding function would be really, really
complicated. You could do set areas. Right, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So it's some, yeah. Right.
But why would you? I don't want to talk about the paradox, like
It is an interesting question, whether a paradigm can have paradoxes and whether that
is a sign of what, what the heck that's a sign of. See, I would argue paradoxes, again, they,
they live at the level of the interpretation. They live at the level of the encoding. They don't
live at the level of the underlying model I would claim.
Well, I mean, there's an interesting question of whether the Rouliat is self interpreting.
What's that? Well, so, so if one makes this distinction between computations and the kind
of interpretation of the encoding of their semantics, does, does the Rouliat contain its own
encoding function? And, you know, and the answer, and the answer, sorry, some levels, yes,
but it depends on what the observer picks out. In other words, it formally contains
what the observer does just as any universal computer formally contains the encoding of,
you know, any coding of that universal computer. Right, but it's not necessarily instantiated.
Yes, one would assume, sorry, Mads had some interjection, which I didn't hear.
Yeah. Sorry.
Well, because again, if you go back to proof theory, you know, so, so, so Banak Tosky
is about a specific model of, of general topology. It's about a model in which, well, ultimately,
well, I mean,
measure theory is topology with an additional function, but anyway, but
we know, so it's all I'm saying. Yeah, it's based on a proof. I think the place where your confusion
may be coming in is that the, the, it's based on a proof theoretic thing, right, which is the fact
that if you allow axiom of choice, you can have, as you say, non-measurable sets. And one of the
consequences of that is, you know, if you have uncountable choice, I should say, that you can
have the Banak Tosky paradox be true. But it's a paradox. The paradox makes reference to particular
balls, right? It makes it makes reference to an actual semantic mathematical structure. It's not
a proof theoretic statement. So again, I maintain the paradox exists at the level of encoding.
It's not, it doesn't exist at the level of proof theory, right? Similarly, Russell's paradox
is a statement about a set. It's about a model of set theory. It's, you know, it's, it's, it's,
it's, it's generated by a proof theoretic problem with set theory. But the way that the paradox is
actually formulated involves you having some kind of semantic interpretation to the underlying
term. Let's take a favorite paradox. Should we take Russell's paradox or should we take the
Banak Tosky, which is, which is the like one term? Well, Banak Tosky is based on a much more
sophisticated formal system. Okay. So I think it's probably easier to analyze the simpler case.
But, okay. So, so can you, can you,
can you please be a better example?
Right. Maybe these guys should, should comment because, yeah.
If I understand Jonathan correctly, then aren't we essentially making the statement that if you
have one Wolfram model where relativity holds but something, some cosmological thing contradicts
itself. So it cannot be a physical model. That's not evidence against Wolfram models in general as
formalism. Whereas, whereas if all Wolfram models had the shortcoming that they couldn't predict
something in reasonable effort, and you would need to add lots of unnecessary complexity,
that would be a criticism against the paradigm itself or the, or the, or the, or the, or the,
yeah. And I think it's the exact same thing with, I don't know that we've created that.
No, no, I mean, and it's the same thing with topics is calculus useful.
And, and no, it seemed to be for the last 200 years.
You know, that's some,
actually a much more straightforward question that we've kind of entered somewhat of basic
which is nothing mind is asking, you know, will multi-competition be proved wrong or not?
He's asking, you know, can this overall paradigm, you know, will that lead to us
positing new theories that could be, you know, confirmed with empirical or experimental, you
know, evidence? That's going to be true. I mean, with economics, for instance, we have some global
law of economics, you know, we could actually test that out. And if it's right, then we'll do very
well. I mean, or whoever tries that, we've also got laws of mathematics that we're talking about,
which, you know, I mean, look, with molecular computing, if molecular computing works well,
which have some, you know, we understand how it works, we should be able to make a molecular
computer, for instance, with physics. I mean, you know, this is something that we want to do
with the institutes. We want to actually bring in an experimentalist. We have the design experiments
that we think can actually verify. Yeah, it's really a shame. There's so many
experimenters that contacted me and said, you know, just tell us particle accelerators, telescopes,
you name it, you know, what should we do to justify some graphs that give us excuses to run?
Well, yes, give us new new experiments to run. But but I think, you know, that that's why several
projects of the summer school have to do with things about, you know, photon propagation through
fractional dimensional space and things like this, because that's where we can tell some, you know,
some, you know, person with a telescope, so to speak, go look for this absolutely bizarre
form of gravitational lensing. And that will be something you couldn't possibly have seen
in an interdimensional space, for example, that will be a nice nice effect.
There are three things that we can do. One is we can build up the overall paradigm.
We can also do what Jonathan was suggesting, which is there are existing theories, we see how
we would model those theories, we can apply, you know, fancy stuff. We can do kind of Occam's razor,
you know, comparisons of our, our, how we model or model it. And we should also have new theories.
And those will be tested experimentally. But also when what we do relates to things like technology,
like distributed computing, I mean, solving problems in the industry as well as a perfectly
valid, you know, kind of experiment, those might think as well. So all three, you know,
building new paradigms, you know, preparing our models with other theories and doing new stuff.
I was also interested in some of the kinds of science that we might have things to say about
are not really natural science. They're things like economics, linguistics,
you know, areas, you know, metamathematics, these are areas that are not traditional
natural science. So the areas where the, it's observations rather than experiments. Same
with the illusion of biology as observations, rather than experiments. So it's a little bit
of a different thing, you know, the, a Popperian model of, of how science works is exceptionally
narrow. And, you know, it's really a very physics-based idea, the experimental physics-based idea.
I'm reminded of it when I worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, there was this older
physicist there who was, I would not say a great friend of mine, but who, when he first was in
the stronghold, when he first come to the Institute, he was telling a story. He had done,
Metka Goedl, who was there. And this guy who explained with great enthusiasm, all the stuff
about how he was studying star clusters and all these kinds of things. And Goedl had said,
that's very nice young man, but I do not believe in natural science. So you can see the, the platonic,
you know, view of, I mean, that's interesting. He says, he doesn't believe in natural science,
because he has this ultimately platonic view of everything. And that, that term, so.
Yes.
Henrosian Trialism as opposed to Cartesian Dualism.
Do we really have motion and there's like some coordination with Goliad? I mean,
part of those pockets aren't going to correspond to anything in our world whatsoever, right? But if,
but if it seems as though we are kind of, we have authority over our domain and the Goliad,
and that seems quite solid, then people will have to take some leap of faith that you can also use
the paradigm to explore things beyond what we have access to. But if we don't have any authority
over our domain, then this, it will all seem to be somewhat speculative. If we do, then someone
will have some faith that this applies more generally, which actually will make it very
interesting. I'm going to try, I'm going to interpret Satyrus's comment as a conjecture that
Plato's form of the good is actually a veiled reference to the Goliad.
It's how we illuminate all other computational structures.
Yeah, right.
Nice. I mean, this is in there.
I mean, in addition to Plato, we go to the theologians and all this kind of thing. There's,
there's a, but I mean, this whole point about, you know, the role of science and the role of us
in science is interesting because in a sense, it could be the case that to make progress in science,
we simply have to understand ourselves more because that's the story of, you know, if the
Goliad is just out there and to know what the science as we perceive it is, we have to understand
more about how we do the perceiving as much as we, you know, as we have to look outwards into
kind of natural world. I'm going to disagree with you there a little bit. I mean, as we've
discussed before, and I think has come up in other conversations, I mean, my view of this is more like
you have, you as the, as the scientists have complete freedom on where you place the computational
burden, right? The traditional case that, you know, as you discussed in NKS of like, you know,
you assume the observer is infinitely computationally sophisticated relative to the system they're
observing, that effectively corresponds to the situation where, you know, if you like, the
observer's computation doesn't matter at all. And all of the dynamics is going on the, in the
computation of the system. The Goliad picture is, you know, in a sense, the system is doing some,
some trivial thing, trivial in the sense that it has basically no algorithmic complexity,
it's just, it's just all possible computations occurring in parallel. And all of the burden
has shifted onto the observer and how they encode things. But I would argue that, you know, in a
sense, is that you have freedom to choose either of those extremes or anywhere in the middle. And
so I don't think it'll ultimately be the case that if you make that selection that you'll end up
being forced to learn more, you know, to encode yourself as an observer to a greater or a lesser
extent than you initially had to to begin with. No, but I think the point is that, that if we were
sort of utterly trivial observers, the fact that we are observers as we are means that our sampling,
you know, we are taking a certain burden in your picture as observers and the burden that we are
taking is causing us to perceive things the way that we perceive things. Yes. If we were taking a
different burden, if we were different from the way we are, we would perceive different things.
And so to know what we are going to perceive, we have to know some characterization of how we
are, so to speak, which is not something that science usually discusses. Well, it actually has
discussed many times, right, to know, you know, relative to the results of being realistic about
simultaneous quantum archives, the results of being realistic about, well, some kind of measurement
thing. Right. You know, so it isn't the case that science has never had to confront this thing
about what observers are like. I think what we realize is in this really odd picture is that
there's a much more of a spotlight back on what we like as observers. But again, I would say that's
really the kind of whole algorithmic complexity aesthetic encoding thing, right? My conjecture
would be that, yes, general relativity and quantum mechanics are elegantly formulated if you are
realistic about the limitations of the observer, which we agree upon. But, you know, the counterclaim
would be that there would be scientific theories which are observationally isomorphic to general
relativity and quantum mechanics, which assume nothing about the nature of the observer, but
which are much more contrived to specify. Yeah, it's just a churn. Right. It's all good. I mean,
you know, then you have everything. I mean, then you can construct everything. It's just not, it's
an observer of immense complexity that's needed to go and, you know, go and construct the churning
machine that constructs the universe, so to speak. It's just a churning machine. It's all good.
Should have been the subtitle 10k. Well, I think that the, I mean, this question about
rural jumps and what happens, you know, we live where we are in rural space, what it's like
elsewhere in rural space. This is why this is why I keep on obsessing about this animal
communication stuff, which might seem, might seem relevant, but that's, you know, that's a case where
we actually have a different place in rural space, so to speak. And, you know, I don't know, I, it's
some, I mean, the other example is in rheology, where we're just jumping to some random place
in the rouliad and where we have no current, you know, and I'm curious in this, in this whole
categorical view of things, right, to what extent, where does the observer picture come in, come into
this categorical view? I mean, in other words, where does the observer enter the categorical
view? And if we jump, if we jump not through hyperspace, which is old science fiction,
we jump through rural space and we land somewhere, maybe that's what really,
really science fiction story, which I haven't yet read, is about jumping through rural space
to somewhere else. But anyway, if we, if we jump through rural space to somewhere else,
we land in this utterly alien, you know, world that is not described in the same way that our
world is described, can we still have category theory? Right. I mean, in some sense, that functoriality
is a version of bad idea, right? Functoriality is a version of rural translation. You're saying,
you know, the semantic interpretation of everything we're dealing with is completely
different, but the underlying compositional structure of our computation is preserved.
And that's, you know, that's at least one form of rural translation. But, and then
on a potentially more interesting level, you know, one way that you can reason towards the
Ruliard, so to speak, is, you know, you take this model of multi-way systems as sort of,
as monoidal categories, and these completion, these towers of completion procedures, which you
can do to effectively populate an entire rural space, you can encode as is discussed in, in,
stuff by, by Xerxes myself and Hatham, you can encode the, you can encode those completions
as the introduction of these higher homotopies or these higher cat, these higher morphisms and so
on. And so eventually, you know, you, you reach some point where in the end, you obtain
some infinity category that is the sort of full Ruliard multi-way system. And then I don't know
whether it's the hyper Ruliard or the ordinary Ruliard or something. There's, there's then a
classifying space of those Ruliard multi-way systems, which is given by some infinity one
top-offs. And then the, the role of the observer is that they are some sort of principle by which
you can take that, either the, the initial infinity category or that infinity one top-offs,
and you vibrate it in some particular way in such a way that the, you know, the multi-way
systems or Ruliard multi-way systems that you, you obtain by, by, by taking some global section
inherit some nice features of the overall infinity category or infinity one top-offs. For instance,
something like spatiality is, it would be a common form of inheritance.
So what you're basically saying is what fibers of aliens are likely to be understandable.
Right. So, so you're asking the question of what, I mean, this is the setting question
basically is in, in the expanse of rural space, you know, where are we likely to find,
you know, aliens that we can understand? And how dense is the set of aliens that we can
understand in rural space? And is it a set of measures zero in some sense in rural space
of, of aliens that we can understand relative to not, and you're saying you're describing
this, this selection in this infinity one top-offs so to speak of things that have certain
properties like spatiality. Right. That. So, so, okay, so prove whether, whether the,
whether the set of aliens we can understand is a set of measures zero.
Well, so my hypothesis about that again is getting very speculative. It's similar to the
speculations about chemistry is that essentially, okay, you know, my, my philosophical perspective
on that question is that, you know, you, you need, that there's, that beyond us, if there's,
if there, if you're outside a very narrow domain of shared cultural experience, communication is,
is impossible because it's, you know, it's, it's essentially the computational equivalence thing,
right. It's indistinguishable from essentially thermodynamic noise. And my hypothesis, my
operative hypothesis has been when thinking about this, that essentially a way you can
encode shared cultural history is through the causal structure of the rural multiway system.
Right. So effectively, so the fibers over which you can have effective communication are those
that have sufficient shared causal history in the event structure. And if you've got fibers that
are completely causally disconnected, then communication becomes theoretically impossible
for essentially reasons that are, those are not the similar to, you know, sort of event horizon
type arguments. Right. This is the same in rural space because there's a rural graph just like
there's a branch of graph. And you're saying that the, you know, you're distant in rural space.
Right. Right. And that, and there's a certain level of distance beyond which, you know,
essentially your, your, your, your past causal ancestor is far enough away that, you know,
communication comes back. Right. That would be one possibility that you're actually
in disconnected regions of rural space. And then you're totally toast. And the aliens in
disconnected regions of rural space are truly, truly gone. Right. Truly separated. But I, but I
think this, let's see. Yeah, I was just going to comment, just a side cultural comment. I mean,
for some reason, this is the year of growth. It seems like, you know, everybody's talking about
growth. You know, there was an article in New Yorker, there's this person who might not be
writing a novel that has a big growth, like character and so on. And I'm trying to understand
why, you know, and that's, that's the world infinity categories and things like this.
And I'm just trying to understand from it. Sorry. So you're talking about what?
Alexander growth and growth and deek. Alexander growth and deek.
And part-time wizard.
I'm probably pronouncing it. Can anybody pronounce growth and deek in it?
Closer. I'm just wondering whether some of his thinking about the infinity category infinity
good boy and so on. What more can we mine? Well, that's the comment I was making about
spatiality, right, as you know. So in effect, Grotendijk had this idea that, you know, one kind
of abstract model you can give for topological spaces that doesn't require you knowing anything
about points or whatever, is to model them as infinity categories. And the reason for that
actually is very interesting. I mean, it's kind of intuitive when you, I mean, it sounds really
weird and abstract. It's kind of intuitive when you think about it in the right way,
which is what you're saying is, you know, okay, so you've got some topological space,
you can look at paths in that space and you can look at, you can look at homotopies between those
paths and you can construct then a homotopy space where the points in the homotopy space are paths
in the original space and the paths in the homotopy space are homotopies in the original space.
And then you can construct its homotopy space and so on, you get this large tower. And in this,
in the categorical interpretation of what's going on now, you know, points are just objects,
paths are just morphisms. Now this is, this gives you a way of constructing an arbitrary
infinity category. And we know that for homotopy spaces, there's at least a large class of cases
in which if you know the infinity homotopy space, you know, the infinite limit of this,
of this picture, that then the structure of that infinite, the infinite limit of these,
of this homotopy tower determines that once you get to the infinite limit, something really
rather remarkable happens where the structure of that space determines the structure of all
the spaces in the hierarchy below it, at least up to weak homotopy equivalents. And so then
basically took that and took that, took that idea. So if you construct the infinity category,
that is the infinity homotopy space for some topological space, it determines everything
that you as a topologist might reasonably care about, about not just the original space, but also
all of its higher homotopy spaces. He took that idea and he just like took it to its logical
conclusion. He said, well, maybe not just, it's not just the case that every topological space is
modeled by an infinity category, but maybe every infinity category can be thought of as a model
of a topological space. And so maybe an abstract definition of what a topological space is up to
weak homotopy equivalents is that it's an infinity category of some description, which then motivated
a lot of this work on trying to classify infinity categories and infinity group points and all
this kind of stuff. And so in the, you know, in the, in the, in the rural picture, and this again is
an insight that's really originally due to, due to the successes, but you know, one question you
can ask is why do, why do so many of the structures that we encounter in the physics project, like
causal graphs, hypergraphs, multi-way systems, et cetera, have spatial interpretations as
Lorentzian manifold, Ramanian manifolds, projective Hilbert spaces, et cetera. And one perspective
on that, which is the kind of cognitive perspective is that you've got this really adds that, that
is the, has the structure, the formal structure of an infinity category. So it is, it is naturally
spatial. It is naturally a topological structure. Then you take an appropriate global section. And
if you take those sections sufficiently judiciously, then those sections effectively inherit spatial
structure from the Rulliad. And so, so one reason why we have one possible explanation why, for why
we have spatiality in physics is that it's all, it's spatiality that's being inherited from the
infinity groupoid structure of, of the Rulliad. Although observers like us, I mean, I, I claim
that spatiality is a feature observed by observers like us. Right. Well, I agree, but that's where
the phrase up to we come ought to be equivalence comes in. Right. So, so, so the, so the spatiality,
so up to we come ought to be equivalence is really a statement about a observer course
grade. Yeah. Right. Which is also a statement about computational boundaries of observers.
Right. And so we come ought to be equivalence is, it's all the same, same story. Yep. And so,
you know, we observe space because, yeah. So I mean, you know, there's this, I'm just so curious
to understand, you know, something, you know, in a sense, the growth of knowledge is a growth,
is an expansion of real space. And I'm sort of impatient to jump to a different place in
real space and understand what's out there. And as, as seen by, but, but of course, then we have a
problem of communication between, you know, it's, I have to say, I'm reminded of sadly,
a thing in the 1950s, when people are first talking about cybernetics, okay,
there's this big proceedings and so on. And there's one of the, one of the core articles
is called communication between the same and the insane, which is kind of a, you know,
could be a version of this kind of familial thing. In those days, the notion of these things
were a bit different. All right, we should probably wrap up many, many, many things that
could be followed up, but we can go to the next one. Thanks very much.
