okay hello everyone well yesterday I posted an essay about observer theory
that's kind of a convergence of a lot of things I've thought about for the last
several years and it's kind of a core piece of the framework sort of the
intellectual framework for the things we've done the physics project the
Rouliad multi computation bunch of other kinds of applications of that so I
thought what I would do here is tell you what I said in this essay that I
posted so the subject is observer theory and the first part is called the
concept of the observer we call it perception we call it measurement we
call it analysis but in the end it's about how we take the world as it is
and derive from it the impression of it that we have in our minds we might have
thought that we could do science purely objectively without any reference to
observers or their nature but what we've discovered particularly dramatically in
our physics project is the nature of us as observers is critical even in
determining the most fundamental laws we attribute to the universe but what
ultimately does an observer say like us do and how can we make a theoretical
framework for it much as we have a general model for the process of
computation instantiated by something like a Turing machine we'd like to have a
general model for the process of observation a general observer theory
central to what we think of as an observer is the notion that the observer
will take the raw complexity of the world and extract from it some reduced
representation suitable for a finite mind there might be zillions of photons
impinging on our eyes but all we extract is the arrangement of objects in a
visual scene or there might be zillions of gas molecules impinging on a piston
yet all we extract is the overall pressure of the gas in the end we can
think of it as fundamentally being about equivalencing there are immense
numbers of different individual configurations for the photons or the
gas molecules that are all treated as equivalent by an observer who's just
picking out the particular features needed for some reduced representation
there's in a sense a certain duality between computation and observation in
computation ones generating new states of a system in observation ones
equivalencing together different states that equivalencing must in the end be
implemented underneath by computation but in observer theory what we want to
do is just characterize the equivalencing that's achieved for us as
observers it might in practice be all about how our senses work what our
biological or cultural nature is or what technological devices or structures
we've built but what makes a coherent concept of observer theory possible is
that it seemed to be general abstract characterizations that capture the
essence of different kinds of observers it's not immediately obvious that
anything suitable for a finite mind could ever be extracted from the
complexity of the world and indeed the principle of computational equivalence
implies that computational irreducibility and its multi computational
generalization will be ubiquitous but within computational irreducibility
there must always be slices of computational reducibility and it's
these slices of reducibility an observer must try to pick out and that
ultimately make it possible for a finite mind to develop a useful narrative
about what happens in the world that allows it to make decisions predictions
and so on how special is what an observer does at its core it's just about
taking a large set of possible inputs and returning a much smaller set of
possible outputs and certainly that's a conceptual idea that's appeared in many
fields under many different names contractive mapping reduction to
a chemical form a classifier an acceptor a forgetful functor evolving to an
attractor extracting statistics model fitting lossy compression projection
phase transitions renormalization group transformations and so on but here we
want to think not about what's mathematically describable but instead
about what is generally what in general is actually implemented say by our
sensors or our measuring devices or our ways of analyzing things at an
ultimate level everything that happens can be thought of as being captured by
the rouliad the unique object that emerges at the entangled limit of all
possible computations and a vast generalization of ideas like that our
brains like any other material thing are made of it it's a vast
generalization of ideas like that our brains like any other material thing
are made of atoms so too any observer must be embedded as some kind of
structure within the rouliad but a key concept of observer theory is that it's
possible to make conclusions about an observer's impression of the world just
by knowing about the capabilities and assumptions of the observer without
knowing in detail what the observer is like inside and so it is for example in
our physics project we seem to be able to derive essentially from the structure
of the rouliad the core laws of 20th century physics general relativity
quantum mechanics the second law just on the basis of two features of us as
observers that we're computationally bounded and that we believe we're
persistent in time even though underneath we're made of different
atoms of space at every successive moment and we can expect that if we were to
take if we were to include other features of us as observers for example
we that we believe we are persistent objects in the world or that we believe
we have free will then we'd be able to derive more aspects of the universe as
we experience it or of natural laws that we attribute to it but the notion of
observers and observer theory isn't purely limited to physical observers it
applies whenever we try to get an impression of something and so for
example we can also operate as mathematical observers sampling the
rouliad to build up conclusions about mathematical laws some features of us
as physical observers like the computational boundedness associated with
the finiteness of our minds inevitably carry over to us as mathematical
observers but other features do not but the point of observer theory is to
provide a general framework in which we can characterize observers and then see
the consequences of those characterizations for the impressions or
conclusions observers will form so now we'll talk about the operation of
observers as humans we have sensors like sight hearing touch taste smell and
balance and through our technology we also have access to a few thousand other
kinds of measurements so how basically do the all these work the vast majority
in effect aggregate a large number of small inputs to generate some kind of
average output which in the case of measurement is often specified as a real
number in a few cases however there's instead a discrete choice between
outputs that's made on the basis of whether the total input exceeds the
threshold think distributed consensus schemes weighing balances and so on but
in all cases what's fundamentally happening is that lots of different
input configurations are all being equivalents or more operationally the
dynamics of the system essentially make all equivalent states evolve the same
attractor state so as an example let's consider measuring the pressure of a
gas there are various ways to do this but a direct one is to have a piston and
just see how much force is exerted by the gas on this piston so where does the
force come from at the lowest level it's the result of individual molecules
bouncing off the surface of the piston each transferring a tiny amount of
momentum to it if we looked at the piston at an atomic scale we'd see it
temporarily deform from each molecular impact but the crucial point is that at
a large scale the piston moves together as a single rigid object aggregating the
effects of all those individual molecular impacts but why does it work that
way essentially it's because the intermolecular forces inside the piston
are much stronger than the forces associated with molecules and the gas
or put more abstractly there's more coupling and coherence inside the
observer than between the observer and what it's observing we see that same
pattern over and over again there's some form of transduction that couples the
individual elements of what's being observed to the observer then within the
observer there's something that in essence aggregates all those small
effects sometimes that aggregation is directly numerical as in the addition of
small lots of small momentum transfers but sometimes it's instead more
explicitly like evolution to one to one attractor rather than another so
consider for example the case of vision an array of photons fall on the photoreceptor
cells and our retinas generating electrical signals transmitted through
the nerve fibers to our brains within the brain there's then effectively a
neural net that evolves to different attractors depending on what one's
looking at most of the time a small change in input image won't affect what
attractor one evolves to but much like with a weighing balance there's an
edge at which even a small change can lead to a different output one can go
through lots of different types of sensory systems and measuring devices
but the basic outline seems to always be the same first there's a coupling
between what is being sensed or measured and the thing that's doing the
sensing or measuring quite often that coupling involves transducing
from one physical form to another say from light to electricity or from force
to position sometimes then the crucial step of equivalencing different
detailed inputs is achieved by simple numerical aggregation most often by
accumulation of objects atoms raindrops etc or by physical effects forces
currents and so on but sometimes the equivalencing is instead achieved by more
obviously dynamical process it could amount to simple amplification in which
say the presence of a small element of input say an individual particle tips
over some metastable system so that it goes into a certain final state or it
could be more like a neural net where there's a more complicated translation
defined by hard to describe borders between basins of attraction leading to
different attractors but okay so what's the end point of a process of
observation ultimately for us humans it's an impression created in our minds
of course that gets into lots of slippery philosophical issues yes each of us has
an inner experience of what's going on in our mind but anything else is
ultimately an extrapolation we make the assumption that other human minds also
see what we see but we can never feel it from the inside we can of course make
increasingly detailed measurements of neural activity to see how similar
what's going on is between one brain and another but as soon as there's the
slightest structural situational difference between the brains we really
can't say exactly how their impressions will compare but for our purposes in
constructing a general observer theory we're basically going to make the
assumption or in effect philosophical approximation that whenever a system
does enough equivalencing that's tantamount to it acting like an observer
because it can then act as a front end that takes the incoherent complexity of
the world and collomates it to the point where a mind would derive impression
from a definite impression from it of course there's still a lot of subtlety
here there has to be just enough equivalencing and not too much for
example if all inputs were always equivalence to the same output there'd
be nothing useful observed and in the end there's somehow got to be some kind of
match between the compression of input achieved by the equivalencing and the
capacity of the mind that's ultimately deriving an impression from it a crucial
feature of anything that can reasonably be called a mind is that something's got
to be going on in there it can't be for example that the internal state of the
system is fixed there has to be some internal dynamics some computational
process that we can identify as the in ongoing operation of the mind and an
informational level we might say that there has to be more information
processing going on inside than there is flow of information from the outside or
in other words if we're going to be meaningful observers like us we can't
just be bombarded by input we don't process we have to have some capability
to think about what we're seeing all of this comes back to the idea that a
crucial feature of us as observers is that we are computationally bounded we do
computation that's why we can have an inner sense of things going on but the
amount of computation we do is tiny compared to the computation going on in
the world around us our experience represents a heavily filtered version of
what's happening outside and the essence of being an observer like this is that
we're effectively doing lots of equivalencing to get that filtered version
but can we imagine a future in which we expand our minds or perhaps encounter
some alien intelligence with a fundamentally less constrained mind well at some
point there's an issue with this because in a sense the idea that we have a
coherent experience existence relies on us having limited minds so without
such constraints there wouldn't be a coherent self that we can identify with
coherent inner experience well let's say we're showing some system say nature
from the outside can we tell if there's an observer in there ultimately not
because in a sense we have to be inside that observer and be able to experience
the impression of the world that it's getting but in much the same way as we
extrapolate to believing that say other human minds are experiencing things
like we're experiencing so also we can potentially extrapolate to say what we
might think of as an observer and the core idea seems to be that an observer
should be a subsystem whose internal states are affected by the rest of the system
but where many external states lead to the same internal state and where there is
rich dynamics within the observer then in effect operates only on its internal states
ultimately following the principle of computational equivalence both the outside
and the inside of the observer subsystem can be expected to be equivalent in the
computations they're performing but the point is that the coupling from the
outside subs from outside the subsystem to inside effectively coarse grains what's
outside so that the inner computation is operating on a much reduced set of elements
why should any such observer subsystems exist presumably at some level it's inevitable
from the presence of pockets of computational reducibility within arbitrarily
computationally irreducible systems but more important for us is that our very
existence and the possibility of our coherent inner experience depends on us
operating as observers and almost as a self-fulfilling prophecy our behavior
tends to perpetuate our ability to successfully do this for example we can think of us as
choosing to put ourselves in situations and environments where we can predict what's going
to happen well enough to survive as observers at a mundane practical level we might do this by
not living in places subject to unpredictable natural forces or by doing things like building
ourselves structures that shelter us from those forces well we've talked about observers
operating by compressing the complexity of the world to inner impressions suitable for finite
minds and in typical situations that we describe as perception and measurement the main way this
happens is by fairly direct equivalencing of different states but in a sense there's a higher
level story that relies on formalization and in essence computation and that's what we usually
call analysis let's say we have some intricate structure perhaps some nested fractal pattern
a direct rendering of all the pixels in this pattern ultimately won't be something well suited
for a finite mind but if we gave rules or a program for generating the pattern we'd have
a much more succinct representation of it but now there's a problem with computational irreducibility
yes the rules determine the pattern but to get from those rules to the actual pattern can require
an irreducible amount of computation and to reverse engineer the pattern to find the rules
can require even more computation yes there are particular cases like repetitive and simple
nested patterns where there's enough immediate computational reducibility that a computational
bounded system or observer can fairly easily do the analysis and get the compression but in general
it's hard and indeed in a sense it's the whole mission of science to pick away at the problem
and try to find more ways to reduce the complexities of the world to human level narratives
computational irreducibility limits the extent to which this can be successful
but the inevitable existence of pockets of reducibility even within computationally
irreducible computational irreducibility guarantees that progress can always in principle
be made as we invent more kinds of measuring devices we can extend our domain as observers
and the same is true when we invent more methods of analysis or identify more principles in science
but the overall picture remains the same what's crucial to being an observer
is equivalencing many states of the world either through perceiving or measuring only
specific aspects of them or through identifying simplified narratives that capture them in effect
persistence and measurement tend to do lossy compression analysis is more about lossless
compression where the equivalencing is effectively not between possible inputs
but between possible generative rules
all right now let's talk about how observers construct their perceived reality
our view of the world is ultimately determined by what we observe of it
we take what's out there in the world and in effect construct our perceived reality
by our operation as observers or in other words insofar as we have a narrative about
what's going on in the world that's something that comes from our operation as observers
and in fact from our physics project we led to we're led to an extreme version of this
in which what's out there in the world is just the whole rule you had and in effect
everything specific about our perceived reality must come from how we operate as observers
and thus we how we sample the rule we add but long before we get to this ultimate level of
abstraction there are lots of ways in which our nature as observers builds our perceived reality
think about any material substance like a fluid ultimately it's made up of lots of individual
molecules doing their thing but observers like us aren't seeing those molecules instead we're
aggregating things to the point where we can just describe the system as a fluid that operates
according to the narrative defined by the laws of fluid mechanics but why do things work this way
ultimately it's the result of the repeated story of the interplay between underlying
computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of us as observers at the lowest level
the motion of the molecules is governed by simple rules of mechanics but the phenomenon of
computational irreducibility implies that to work out the detailed consequences of running these rules
involves an irreducible amount of computational work which is something that we as computationally
bounded observers can't do and the result of this is that we'll end up describing the detailed
behavior of the molecules as just random well i've talked about this at length elsewhere but
this is the fundamental origin of the second law of thermodynamics but for our purposes here the
important point is that it's what makes observers like us construct the reality of things like fluids
our computational boundedness as observers makes us unable to trace all the detailed
behavior of molecules and leaves us content to describe fluids in terms of the narrative
defined by the laws of fluid mechanics our physics project implies that it's the same
kind of story with physical space for our physics project space is ultimately made of a network
of relations or connections between discrete atoms of space that's progressively being updated
in what ends up being a computationally irreducible way but we as computationally bounded observers
can't decode all the details of what's happening and instead we end up with a simple aggregate
narrative that turns out to correspond to continuum space operating according to the laws of general
activity the way both coherent notions of matter or fluids and space time emerge for us as observers
can be thought of as a consequence of the equivalencing we do as observers
in both cases there's immense and computationally irreducible complexity underneath but we're
ignoring most of that by effectively treating different detailed behaviors as equivalent
so that in the end we get to a comparatively simple narrative more suitable for our finite minds
but we should emphasize that what's really going on in the system is something much more complicated
it's just that we as observers aren't paying attention to that so our perceived reality is much
simpler okay but what about quantum mechanics well in a sense that's an extreme test of our
description of how observers work and the extent to which the operation of observers constructs their
perceived reality so let's talk now about the case of quantum mechanics in our physics project the
underlying structure hypergraph that represents space and everything in it is progressively being
rewritten according to definite rules but the crucial point is that at any given stage there
can be lots of ways this rewriting can happen and the result is that there's a whole tree of possible
states of the universe that can be generated so given this why do we ever think that definite
things happen in the universe why don't we just think that there's an infinite tree of branching
histories for the universe well it has to do with our nature of as observers and the equivalencing
we do at an immediate level we can imagine looking at all those different possible branching paths
for the evolution of the universe and the key point is that even though they come from different
paths of history two states can just be the same sometimes it'll be obvious that they're the same
sometimes we might have to determine say where the two hypergraphs are isomorphic but the point is
that to any observer at least one that isn't managing to look at arbitrary implementation
details the states will inevitably be considered equivalent but now there's a bigger point
even though from the outside there might be a whole branching and merging multi-way
graph of histories for the universe observers like us can't trace that and in fact all we
perceive is a single thread of history or said another way we believe that we have a single
thread of experience something closely related to our belief that despite the changing underlying
elements from which we're made we're somehow persistent in time at least during the span
of our existence but operationally how do we go from all those underlying branches of history
to our perceived single thread of history we can think of the states on different threads of
history as being related by what we call a branching graph that joins states that have
immediate common ancestors and in the limit of many threads we can think of these different
states as being laid out in branching space in traditional quantum mechanics terms this layout
defines a map of quantum entanglements with each piece of common ancestry representing
an entanglement between states in physical space whether we're looking at molecules in a fluid
or atoms of space we can think of us operating as observers who are physically large enough
to span many underlying discrete elements so that what we end up observing is just some kind of
aggregate average result and it's very much the same kind of thing in branching space we as observers
tend to be large enough in branchial space to be spread across an immense number of branches of
history so that what we observe is just an aggregate just aggregate average results across all those
branches well there's lots of detailed complexity in what happens on different branches just like
there is in what happens to different molecules or different atoms of space and the reason that
there's inevitably computational irreducibility or in this case more accurately multi computational
irreducibility but computationally bounded observers like us just perceive aggregate results
that average out the underlying apparent randomness to give a consistent thread of experience and
effectively this is what happens in the transition from quantum to classical behavior even though
there are many possible detailed quantum threads of history that an object can follow what we
perceive corresponds to a single consistent aggregate classical sequence of behavior
and this is typically true even at the level of our typical observations of molecules and
chemical processes yes there are many possible threads of history for say a water molecule
but most of our observations aggregate things to the point where we can talk about a definite shape
for the molecule with definite chemical bonds and so on but there is a special situation that
actually looms large in typical discussions of quantum mechanics we can think of it as the
result of doing measurements that aren't aggregating threads of history to get an average
but are instead doing something more like a weighing balance always tipping one way or the other
in the language of quantum computing we might say that we're arranging things to be able to
measure a single qubit in terms of equivalencing of states we might say that we're equivalencing
lots of underlying states to specific canonical states like spin up and spin down
why do we get one outcome rather than another ultimately we can think of it all as depending
on the details of us as observers to see this let's start from the corresponding question
of physical space we might ask why we observe some particular thing happening well in our physics
project everything about what happens is deterministic but there's still the arbitrariness of where we
are in physical space we'll always see basically the same laws of physics but the particulars of
what we'll observe depends on where we are say on the surface of the earth versus an interstellar
space and so on is there a theory for where we are in some sense yes because we can go back and
see why all the molecules that make us up landed in the particular place where they did but what
we can't have as an external theory for is just which molecules end up making up us as we experience
ourselves from inside in our view of physics and the universe it's in some sense the only
ultimately subjective thing where our internal experience is situated but the point is that
basically even though it's much less familiar the same thing is going on at the level of
quantum mechanics just as we happen to be at a certain place in physical space so we're at a
certain place in branching space looking back we can trace how we got here but there's no
a priori way to determine where our particular experience will be situated and that means we
can't know what the local branchial environment will be and so for example what the outcome of
balance like measurements will be just as in traditional discussions of quantum mechanics
the mechanics of doing the measurement which we can think of as effectively equivalencing
many underlying branches of history will have an effect on subsequent behavior and
subsequent measurements but let's say we just look at the level of the underlying
multiway graph or more specifically the multiway causal graph that records causal connections
between different updating events then we can identify a complicated web of interdependence
between events that are time-like space-like and branch-like separated and this interdependence
seems to correspond to precisely to what's expected from quantum mechanics in other words
even though the multiway graph is completely determined the arbitraryness of where the observer
is particularly in branchial space combined with the inevitable interdependence of different
aspects of the multiway causal graph seems sufficient to reproduce the not quite purely
probabilistic features of quantum mechanics in making observations of physical space it's
common to make a measurement at one place or time then make another measurement at another
place or time and for example see how they're related but in actually doing this the observer
will have to move from one place to another and persist from one time to another and in the abstract
it's not obvious that that's possible for example it could be that an observer won't be able to move
without changing or in other words that pure motion won't be possible for an observer but in
effect this is something we as observers assume about ourselves and indeed as I've talked about
elsewhere actually this is a crucial part of why we perceive spacetime to operate according to the
laws of physics we know but what about in branchial space we have much less intuition for this than
physical space but we still effectively believe that pure motion is possible for us as observers in
branchial space it could be like an observer in physical space near say near a spacetime singularity
that an observer will get shredded when trying to move in branchial space but our belief is that
typically nothing like that happens at some level being at different locations in branchial space
presumably corresponds to picking different bases for our quantum states or effectively to
defining our measurements differently and somehow our belief in the possibility of pure
motion in branchial space seems related to our belief in the possibility of making arbitrary
sequences of choices in sets of experiments we do
all right let's talk about observers of abstract worlds we might have thought that
the only thing ultimately out there for us to observe would be our physical universe
but actually there are important situations where we're essentially operating not as observers
of our familiar physical universe but instead of what amount to abstract universes and what
we'll see is that the ideas of observer theory seem to apply there too except that now what we're
picking out and reducing to internal impressions a feature is not of the physical world but of
abstract worlds our physics project in a sense brings ideas about the physical and abstract
worlds closer and the concept of the Rulliard ultimately leads to a deep unification between
them for what we now imagine is that the physical universe as we perceive it is just the result of
the particular kinds of sampling of the Rulliard made by us as certain kinds of observers and the
point is that we as observers can make other kinds of samplings leading to what we can describe as
abstract universes and one particularly prominent example of this is mathematics or rather
metamathematics imagine starting from all possible axioms for mathematics then constructing the
network of all possible theorems that can be derived from them we can consider this as forming
a kind of metamathematical universe and the particular mathematics that some mathematician
might study we can then think of as the result of a mathematical observer observing that
metamathematical universe there are both close analogies and differences between this and the
experience of a physical observer in the physical universe both ultimately correspond to samplings
of the Rulliard but somewhat different ones in our physics project we imagine that physical space
and everything in it is ultimately made up of discrete elements that we identify as atoms of
space but in the Rulliard in general we can think of everything as being made up of pure
atoms of existence that we call eames in the particular case of physics we interpret these
eames as atoms of space but in metamathematics we can think of eames as corresponding to sub-axiomatic
elements of symbolic structures from which things like axioms or theorems can be constructed
the central feature of our interaction with the Rulliard for physics is that observers like us
don't track the detailed behavior of all the various atoms of space instead we equivalence
things to the point where we can get descriptions that are reduced enough to fit in our minds
and something similar is going on in mathematics we don't track all the individual sub-axiomatic
eames or usually in practice even the details of fully formalized axioms and theorems instead
mathematics typically operates at a much higher level and more human level dealing not with questions
like how real numbers can be built from eames or even axioms but rather with what can be deduced
about the properties of mathematical objects like real numbers in a physics analogy to the
behavior of the gas typical human mathematics operates not at the molecular level of individual
eames or even axioms but rather at the fluid dynamics level of human accessible mathematical
concepts in effect therefore a mathematician is operating as an observer who equivalences many
detailed configurations ultimately of eames in order to form a higher level mathematical constructs
suitable for our computationally bounded minds and while at the outset we might have imagined
that anything in the Rulliard could serve as a possible mathematics the point is that observers
like us can only sample the Rulliard in particular ways leading to only particular possible forms
for human accessible mathematics it's a very similar story to the one we've encountered many
times in thinking about physics and studying gases for example we could imagine all sorts of theories
based on tracking detailed molecular motions but for observers like us with our computational
boundedness we inevitably end up with things like the second row of thermodynamics the laws
of fluid mechanics and in mathematics the main thing we end up with is higher level mathematics
mathematics that we can do directly in terms of typical textbook concepts rather than constantly
having to drill down to the level of atoms or eames in physics we're usually particularly
concerned with issues like predicting how things will evolve through time in mathematics it's more
about accumulating what can be considered true and indeed we can think of an idealized mathematician
as going through the Rulliard and collecting in their minds a bag of theorems or axioms
that they consider to be true and given such a collection they can essentially follow the
entailment paths defined by computations of the Rulliard to find more theorems to add to their bag
and yes if they put in a false theorem then because of false premise and the standard set of
logic implies everything they'll end up with an infinite explosion of theorems that won't fit in
a finite mind in observing the physical universe we talk about our different possible senses like
vision hearing etc or different kinds of metering devices in observing the mathematical universe
the analogy is basically different possible kinds of theories or abstractions
say algebraic versus geometrical versus topological versus categorical
and so on with new approaches being like new kinds of measuring devices
particularly when we think in terms of the Rulliard we can expect a certain kind of ultimate
unity in the methamathematical universe but different theories and different abstractions
will pick up different aspects of it just as vision and hearing pick up different aspects
of the physical universe but in a sense observer theory gives us a global way to talk about this
and to characterize what kinds of observations observers like us can make whether of the physical
universe or of the mathematical one in physics we've then seen in our physics project how this
allows us to find general laws that describe our perception of the physical world and that turn
out to reproduce the core known laws of physics in mathematics we're not as familiar with the
concept of general laws though the very fact that higher level mathematics is possible is presumably
in essence such a law and perhaps the kinds of regularities seen in areas like category theory
are others as are the inevitable dualities we expect to be able to identify between different
fields of mathematics all these laws ultimately rely on the structure of the Rulliard but the
crucial point is that they're not talking about the raw Rulliard instead they're talking about just
certain samplings of the Rulliard that can be done by observers like us and that lead to certain
kinds of internal impressions in terms of which these laws can be stated mathematics represents
a certain kind of abstract setup that's been studied in a particular detailed way over the
centuries but it's not the only kind of abstract setup we can imagine and indeed there's an even
much more familiar one the use of concepts and words and human thinking and language we might
imagine that at some time the distant past our forebears could signify say rocks only by pointing
at individual ones but then there emerged the general notion of rock captured by a word for rock
and once again this is a story of observers and equivalences when we look at a rock it presumably
produces all sorts of detailed patterns of neuron firings in our brains different for each particular
rock but somehow presumably essentially through evolution to an attractor in the neural mass in
our brains we equivalence all those patterns to extract our inner impression of the concept of a rock
in the typical tradition of quantitative science we tend to be interested in doing measurements
that lead to things like numerical results but in representing the world using language we tend to
be interested instead in creating symbolic structures that involve collections of discrete
words embedded in a grammatical framework such linguistic descriptions don't capture every
detail in a typical observer kind of way they broadly equivalence many things in a sense reduce
the complexity of the world to a description in terms of a limited number of discrete words
and linguistic forms within any person's given person's brain there'll be thoughts defined by
patterns of neuron firings and the crucial role of language is to provide a robustly a way to
robustly package up those thoughts and for example represent them with discrete words
so that they can be communicated to another person and unpacked in that person's brain
to produce neuron firings that reproduce what amounts to the same those same thoughts
when we're dealing with something like a numerical measurement we might imagine that
it could have some kind of absolute interpretation but words are much more obviously an arbitrary
basis for communication we could pick a different specific word say from a different human language
but still communicate the same thing all that's required is that everyone who's using the word
agrees on its meaning and presumably that normally happens because of shared social
history between people who use a given word it's worth pointing out that for this to work there
have to be a certain separation of scales the collective impression of the meaning of a word
may change over time but that change has to be slow compared to the rate at which the word
is used in actual communication in effect the meaning of a word as we humans might understand
it emerges from the aggregation of many individual uses in the abstract there might not be any reason
to think that there'd be a way to understand words consistently but it's a story very much like what
we've encountered in both physics and mathematics even though there are lots of complicated individual
details underneath we as observers managed to pick out features that are simple enough for us to
understand in the case of molecules in a gas that might be the overall pressure of a gas in the case
of words it's a stable notion of meaning put another way the possibility of language is another
example of observer theory at work inside our brains there are all sorts of complicated neuron
firings but somehow these can be packaged up into things like words that form human level narratives
there's a certain complicated feedback loop between the world as we experience it
and the words we use to describe it we invent words for things that we commonly encounter
chair table and so on yet once we have a word for something we're more able to form thoughts
about it or communicate about it and that in turn makes us more likely to put instances of it in our
environment in other words we tend to build our environment so that we have ways of making
narratives about it that work well or in effect so that our inner description of it can be as
simple as possible and act it can be as predictable to us as possible we can view our experience of
physics and mathematics as being the result of us acting as physical observers and mathematical
observers now we're viewing our experience of the conceptual universe as being the result of us
acting as conceptual observers but what's crucial is that in all these cases we have the same intrinsic
features as observers computational boundedness and a belief in persistence the computational
boundedness is what makes us equivalence things to the point where we can have symbolic descriptions
of the world for example in terms of words and the belief in persistence is what lets those words
have persistent meanings and actually these ideas extend beyond just language to paradigms
and general ways of thinking about things when we define a word we're in effect defining an
abstraction for a class of things and paradigms are somehow a generalization of this ways of
taking lots of specifics and coming up with a uniform framework for them when we do this we're
in effect making a classic observer theory move and equivalencing lots of different things to
produce an internal impression that's simple enough to fit in our finite minds
In the end it's all just the Rouliat our tendency as observers is always to believe that we can
separate our inner experience from what's going on in the outside world but in the end everything
is just part of the Rouliat and at the level of the Rouliat we as observers are ultimately made
of the same stuff as everything else but we can imagine can we imagine that we can point at one
part of the Rouliat and say that's an observer and another part and say that's not at least to some
extent the answer is presumably yes at least if we restrict ourselves to observers like us but it's
a somewhat subtle and seemingly circular story for example one core feature of observers like us is
that we have a certain persistence or at least we believe we have a certain persistence but inevitably
at the level of the Rouliat we're continually being made of different atoms of existence i.e.
different eons so in what sense are we persistent well the point is that an observer can equivalence
those different successive patterns of eons so that they can so that what they observe
is persistent and yes this is at least on the face of its circular and ultimately to identify
what parts of the Rouliat might be persistent enough to be observers will have to ground this
circularity in some kind of further assumption what about the computational boundedness of
observers like us which forces us to do lots of equivalencing at some level that equivalencing
must be implemented by lots of different states evolving to the same states but once again there's
circularity because even to define what we mean by the same states our isomorphic graphs the same
and so on we have to be imagining certain equivalencing so how do we break out of the
circularity the key is presumably the presence of additional features that define observers like us
and one important class of such features has to do with scale we're neither tiny nor huge
we involve enough eons that consistent averages can emerge yet we don't involve so many eons that
we span anything but an absolutely tiny part of the whole Rouliat and actually a lot of our
experience is determined by our size as observers we're large enough that certain
equivalencing is inevitable yet we're small enough that we can reasonably think of there being many
choices for where we are the overall structure of the Rouliat is a matter of formal necessity
there's only one possible way for it to be but there's contingency in our character as observers
and for example in a sense there's a fundamental constant of nature as we perceive it which is our
extent in the Rouliat say measured in Eames and appropriately projected into physical space
branchial space and so on and the fact that this extent is small compared to the whole Rouliat
means that there are many possible observers who can think of existing at different positions in
the Rouliat and those different observers will look at the Rouliat from different points of view
and thus develop different internal impressions of perceived reality but a crucial fact central
to our physics project is that there are certain aspects of that perceived reality that are inevitable
for observers like us and that correspond to the core laws of physics but when it gets to more
specific questions what does the night sky look like from where you are and so on different observers
will inevitably have different versions of perceived reality so is there a way to translate
from one observer to another essentially that's the story of motion what happens when an observer
that's at one place in the Rouliat moves to another place inevitably the observer we made
of different Eames if it's at a different place but it will somehow but will it somehow still be
the same well that's a subtle question that depends both on the background structure of the Rouliat
and the nature of the observer if the Rouliat is too wild think near space time and near a
singularity then the observer will inevitably be shredded as it moves but computational
irreducibility implies a certain overall regularity to most of the Rouliat making pure motion at
least conceivable but to achieve pure motion the observer still has to be made of something
that is somehow robust essentially some lump of computational reducibility that can predictably
survive the underlying background of computational irreducibility in space time we can identify such
lumps with things like black holes and particles like electrons photons and so on and yes in our
models there's probably considerable commonality between black holes and particles it's not yet
clear quite what the analog is in Braunschild space though very simple example might involve
persistence of qubits and in Roulial space one kind of analog is the very notion of concepts
for an effect concept as represented for example by words are the analog of particles in Roulial
space they are the robust structures that can move across Roulial space and maintain their identity
carrying the same thoughts to different minds so what does all this mean for what can constitute
observer in the Rouliat observers in effect leverage computational reducibility to extract
simplified features that can fit in finite minds but observers themselves must also embody
computational reducibility in order to maintain their own persistence and the persistence of the
features they extract or in other words observers must in a sense always correspond to patches of
regularity in the Rouliat but can any patch of regularity in the Rouliat be thought of as an
observer probably not usefully so because another feature of observers like us is that we're connected
in some kind of collective social framework not only do we individually form internal impressions
in our minds but we also communicate these impressions and indeed without such communication
we wouldn't for example be able to set up things like coherent languages with which to describe things
what do we assume about ourselves a key implication of our physics project and the concept of the
Rouliat is that we perceive the universe to be the way we do because we are the way we are as
observers and the most fundamental aspect of observers like us is that we're doing lots
of equivalencing to reduce the complexity of the world to internal impressions that fit in our
minds but just what kinds of equivalencing are we actually doing at some level a lot of that is
defined by the things we believe or assume about ourselves in the way we interact with the world
a very central assumption we make is that we're somehow stable observers of a changing outside
world of course at some level we're actually not stable at all we're made up from different
aims whose configurations whose configuration is changing all the time but our belief in our own
stability and in effect our belief in our persistence in time makes us equivalence those
configurations and having done that equivalencing we perceive the universe to operate in a certain
way that turns out to align with the laws of physics we know but actually there's more than
just our assumption of persistence in time for example we also have an assumption of our persistence
in space we assume that at least on reasonably short time scales we're consistently observing the
universe from the same place and not say continually darting around the network that represents space
is continually changing around us but we're equivalence things so that we can assume that
in a first approximation we are staying in the same place of course we don't believe that we have to
stay exactly the same place and exactly the same place all the time we believe we're able to move
and here we make what amounts to another assumption of stability we assume that pure
motion is possible for us as observers in other words we assume that we can go to different
places and still be the same us with the same properties as observers at the level of the
rule rule yard it's not at all obvious that such an assumption that such assumptions can be consistently
made but as we discussed before the fact that for observers like us they can at least to a good
approximation do this as a reflection of certain properties of us as observers in particular of
our physical scale being large in terms of atoms of space but small in terms of the whole universe
related to our assumption about motion is our assumption that space exists or that we can treat
space as something coherent underneath there's all sorts of complicated dynamics of changing
patterns of eames but on the time scales at which we experience things we can equivalence these
patterns to allow us to think of space as having a coherent structure and once again the fact that
we can do this as a consequence of the physical scales associated with us as observers in particular
the speed of light is fast enough that it brings information to us from the local region around
us in much less time than it takes our brain to process it and this means that we can equivalence
all the different ways in which different pieces of information reach us and we can consistently
just talk about the state of a region of space at a given time part of our assumption that we're
persistent in time is that our threat of experience is at least locally continuous with no breaks
yes we're born and we die and we also sleep but we assume that at least on scales relevant for our
ongoing perception of the world we experience time as something continuous more than that we
assume that we have just a single thread of experience or in other words that there's always
just one us going through time of course even at the level of neurons in our brains all sorts of
activity goes on in parallel but somehow in our normal psychological state we seem to concentrate
everything so that our inner experience follows just one thread of history on which we can operate
in a computationally bounded way and form definite memories and have definite sequences of thoughts
we're not as familiar with branch shield spaces with physical space but presumably our fundamental
assumption of stability extends there as well and when combined with our basic computational
boundedness then becomes inevitable that as we talked about before will conflate different
quantum paths of history to give us observers a definite classical thread of inner experience
beyond stability another very important assumption we implicitly make about ourselves is what
amounts to an assumption of independence we imagine that we can somehow separate ourselves
off from everything else and one aspect of this is that we assume one aspect of this we assume we
are localized and that most of the rulliad doesn't matter to us so that we can equivalence all the
different states of the rest of the rulliad but there's an also another aspect of independence
and in fact we can choose to do whatever we want independent of the rest of the universe
and this means that we assume that we can for example essentially do any possible experiment
make any possible measurement or go anywhere we want in physical or branch shield space or
indeed rural space we assume that we effectively have free will about these things determined only
about inner choices and independent of the state of the rest of the universe ultimately of course
we're just part of the rulliad and everything we do is determined by the structure of the rulliad
and our history within it but we can view our belief of freedom as a reflection of the fact
that we don't know a priori where will be located in the rulliad and even if we did
computational irreducibility would prevent us from making predictions about what we will do
beyond our assumptions about our own independence from the rest of the universe
there's also the questions of end the question of independence between different parts of what
we observe and quite central to our way of processing the world is our typical assumption
that we can think about different things separately in other words we assume it's
possible to factor what we see happening in the universe into independent parts
in science this manifests itself in the idea that we can do controlled experiments in which
we study how something behaves in isolation from everything else it's not self-evident that this
will be possible and indeed in some areas like ethics it might be fundamentally not be but we
as observers tend to implicitly assume it and actually we normally go much further because
we typically assume that we can describe and think about the world symbolically in other
words we assume that we can take all the complexity of the world and represent at least the parts of
what we care about in terms of discrete symbolic concepts of the kind that appear in human or
computational language there's lots of detail in the world that our limited collection of symbolic
concepts doesn't capture and effectively equivalence is out but the point is that it's this symbolic
description that normally seems to form the backbone of the inner narrative we have about the world
there's another implicit assumption that's being made here however and that's that there's some kind
of stability in the symbolic concepts we're using yes any particular mind might pass the world
using a particular set of symbolic concepts but we make the implicit assumption that there are other
minds out there that work like ours and this makes us imagine that there can be some form of objective
reality that's just always out there to be sampled by whatever mind might happen to come along
not only therefore do we assume our own stability as observers we also assume a certain stability
to what we perceive of everything that's out there underneath there's all the wildness and
complexity of the rule we add but we assume that we can successfully equivalence things
to the point where all we perceive is something quite stable and something we can describe as
ultimately governed by consistent laws it could be that every part of the universe just does its
own thing with no overall laws tying everything together but we make the implicit assumption
that no the universe at least as far as we perceive it is a more organized and consistent place
and indeed it's that assumption that makes it feasible for us to operate as observers like us
at all and even to imagine that we can usefully reduce the complexity of the world to something
that fits in our finite minds the cost of observation what resources does it take for
an observer to make an observation in most of traditional science observation is at best added
as an afterthought and no account is taken for the process by which it occurs and indeed for
example in the traditional formalism of quantum mechanics while measurement can have an effect
on a system it's still assumed to be an indivisible act without any internal process
but an observer theory was centrally talking about the process of observation and so it makes
sense to try asking questions about the resources involved in this process we might start with our
own everyday experience something happens out in the world what resources and for example how much
time does it take for us to form an impression of it let's say that out in the world a cat either
comes into view or it doesn't there are signals that come to our brain from our eyes effectively
carrying data on each pixel in our visual field then inside our brain these signals are processed
by a succession of layers of neurons with us in the end concluding either that there is a cat
there or there's not and from artificial neural nets we can get a pretty good idea of how this
likely works and the key to it as we talked about before is that there's an attractor
lots of different detailed configurations of pixel it's all evolved to the same
cat or no cat final state the different configurations have been equivalenced
so that only a final conclusion survives the story is a bit trickier though because cat or no cat
really isn't the final state of our brain hopefully it's not the last thought we have
instead our brain will continue to think more thoughts so cat or no cat is at best some kind
of intermediate waypoint in our process of thinking an instantaneous conclusion that will
continue to build on and indeed when we consider measuring devices like a piston measuring the
pressure of a gas we similarly usually imagine that they will come to an instantaneous conclusion
but continue operating and producing more data but how long should we wait for each individual
conclusion how long for example will it take for the stressors generated by a particular pattern
molecules hitting a piston to dissipate out and for the piston to be ready to produce more data
there are lots of specific questions of physics here but if our purpose is to build a formal
observer theory how should we think about such things there is something of analogy
in the formal theory of computation an actual computational system say in the physical world
will just keep computing but in formal computation theory it's useful to talk about computations that
halt and about functions that can be evaluated and give a definite answer so what's the analog
of this an observer theory instead of general computations we're interested in computations
that effectively implement equivalences or put another way we want computations that destroy
information that have many incoming states but few outgoing states as a practical matter we
can either have the outgoing states explicitly represent whole equivalence classes or they
can just be canonical representation representatives like in a network where at each step each element
takes on whatever the majority or consensus value of its neighbors was but however it works
we can still ask questions about what the computational resources were that were involved
how many steps did it take how many elements were involved and with the idea that observers like us
are computationally bounded we expect limitations on these resources but with this formal setup we
can start asking just how far an observer like us can get saying coming to a conclusion about the
results of some computationally irreducible process an interesting case arises in putative
quantum computers in the model implied by a physics project such a quantum computer effectively
performs many computations in parallel on the separate branches of a multi-way system
representing the various threads of history of the universe but if the observer tries to come
to a conclusion about what actually happened they have to knit together all those threads of history
in effect by implementing equivalences between them one could in principle imagine an observer
who just follow all the quantum branches but it wouldn't be an observer like us because what seems
like a core feature of observers like us is that we believe we have just a single thread of experience
and to maintain that belief our process of observation must equivalence all the different
quantum branches how much effort will that be well inevitably if a thread of history branched
our equivalencing has to undo that branching and that suggests that the number of elementary
equivalencings will have to be at least comparable to the number of elementary branchings making it
seem that the effort of observation will tend to be at least comparable to reduction that the
the will tend to be at least comparable to the reduction of effort associated with
parallelism in the underlying quantum process actually I have to say I wonder
the in general it's interesting to compare this sort of effort of observation with the effort of
computation with our concept of elementary equivalencings we have a way to measure both
in terms of computational aberrations and yes both could in principle be implemented
by something like a Turing machine and practice the equivalencings might be more most conveniently
modeled by something more like string rewriting and indeed one can often go much further talking
not directly in terms of equivalencings but rather about processes that show attractors
there are different kinds of attractors sometimes like in class one cellular automata
there's just a limited number of static fixed global fixed points say either all cells black or
all cells white but in other cases like such as class three cellular automata the number of
output space states may be smaller the number of input states but there may be no maybe no
computationally simple characterization of them observers like us though mostly seem to make use
of the fixed points we try to symbolize the world taking all the complexities out there
and reducing them to discrete conclusions that we might for example describe using the
discrete words in a language there's an immediate subtlety associated with attractors of any time
though typical physics is reversible in the sense that any process say two molecules scattering from
each other can run equally well forwards and backwards but in an attractor one goes from
lots of possible initial states to a smaller number of attractor final states and there are two
basic ways this can happen even when there's underlying reversibility first the systems on
studying can be open in the sense that effects can radiate out of the region that one's studying
and seconds the states the system gets into can be complicated enough that say a computationally
bounded observer will inevitably equivalence them and indeed that's the main thing that's
happening for example when a system reaches them an dynamic equilibrium as described by the second
law and actually once again there's often a certain circularity one is trying to determine
whether an observer has finished observing and come to a conclusion but one needs an observer
to make that determination can we tell if we finished forming a thought or we have to think
about it in effect by forming another thought put another way imagine we're trying to determine
whether a piston has come to a conclusion about pressure and a gas particularly if there's microscopic
reversibility the piston and things around it will continue wiggling around and it will take
an observer to determine whether the heat is dissipated to the point where one can read out
the result how do we break out of what seems like an infinite regress the point is that whatever
mind is ultimately forming the impression that is the observation is inevitably the final arbiter
and yes this could mean that we'd always have to start discussing all sorts of things
about photoreceptors and neurons and so on but as we've discussed before at some length
the key point that makes the general observer theory possible is that there are many conclusions
that can be drawn for large classes of observers independent of these details
but okay what happens if we think about the rule rule we add now we have all the
eems and elementary events updating and updating updating events for configurations of them in a
sense we're fishing out of this pieces that represent observers and pieces that represent
things they're observing can we assess the cost of observation there it really depends on the
fundamental scale of what we consider to be observers in fact we might even think of our
scale as observers say measured in eems or elementary events as defining a fundamental
constant of nature at least for the universe as we perceive it but given this scale we can for
example ask for that to develop consensus across it or at least for every e-minute to have had time
to communicate with every other in an attempt to formalize the cost of observation will inevitably
have to make what seem like arbitrary choices just as we were in setting up a scheme to determine
when an outgoing computational process has generated an answer but if we sorry an ongoing
computational process has generated an answer but if we assume a certain boundedness in our
choices we can expect that we'll be able to draw definite conclusions and in effect be able to
construct an analog of computational complexity theory for processes of observation
well what's the future of observer theory well my goal in this essay is to explore some of the
key concepts and principles needed to create a framework that we can call observer theory
what i've done so far is just the beginning and there's much still to be done in fleshing out the
theory and investigating its implications one important place to start is a making more explicit
models of the mechanics of observation at the level of the general theory it's all about
equivalencing but how specifically is that equivalencing achieved in particular cases
there are many thousands of kinds of sensors measuring devices analysis methods and so on
all of these should be systematically inventoried and classified and in each case there's a
meta model to be made that clarifies just how equivalencing is achieved and for example what
separation of physical or other scales makes it possible human experience and human minds are
the inspiration and ultimate grounding for our concept of an observer and insofar as neural
nets trained on what amounts to human experience have emerged as somewhat faithful models for what
human minds do we can expect to use them as a fairly detailed proxy for observers like us
so for example we can imagine exploring things like quantum observers by studying
multi-way generalizations of neural nets and this is something that becomes easier
if instead of organizing the data in neural nets into a real number weights we can atomize neural
nets into purely discrete elements well such investigations of potentially realistic models
provide a useful practical grounding for observer theory but to develop a general observer theory
we need a more formal notion of an observer and there is no doubt a whole abstract framework
perhaps using methods from areas like category theory that can be developed purely on the basis
of our concept of observers being about equivalencing but to understand the connection of observer
theory to things like science as done by us humans we need to tighten up what it means to be an
observer like us what exactly are all the general things that we believe about ourselves as we
discussed above many many we take us we so much take for granted that it's challenging for us to
identify them as actually just beliefs that in principle don't have to be that way but I suspect
that the more we tighten up our definition of observers like us the more we will be able to
explain why we perceive the world the way we do and attribute to it the laws and properties we do
is there's some feature of observers like us for example that makes us parse the physical world
as being three-dimensional we could represent the same data about what's out there by assigning
one-dimensional kind of space-filling coordinate to everything but somehow observers like us don't
do that and instead we effectively probe the rule ad by sampling it in what we perceive as
three-dimensional slices and yes the most obvious coarse-graining just considers progressively larger
GDC balls say in the spatial hypergraph that appear in our physics project but that's probably
at best an approximation to the sampling that observers like us do as part of our physics project
we've discovered that the structure of the three main theories of 20th century physics just on
mechanics general relativity and quantum mechanics can be derived from properties of the rule ad
just by knowing that observers like us are computationally bounded and believe we're
persistent in time but how might we reach say the standard model of particle physics with all its
particular values of parameters and so on some may be inevitable given the underlying structure
of our theory but others one suspects are in effect reflections of aspects of us as observers
they are derivable but only given out particular characteristics or beliefs as observers and yes
presumably things like the constant of nature that characterizes our size in eames will appear in
the laws we attribute to the universe as we perceive it and by the way these considerations
of observers like us extend beyond physical observers so for example as we tighten up our
characterization of what we're like as mathematical observers we can expect that this will constrain
the possible laws of the mathematical universe we might have thought that we could pick whatever
axioms we want in effect sampling the rule ad to get any mathematics we want but presumably
observers like us can't do this so the questions like is the continuum hypothesis true can
potentially have definite answers for any observers like us and for any coherent mathematics that we
build but in the end do we really have to consider observers whose characteristics are grounded in
human experience we already reflexively generalize our own personal experiences to those of other
humans can we go further we don't have the internal experience of being a dog an ant colony a computer
or an ocean and typically at best we anthropomorphize such things trying to reduce the behavior we
perceive in them the elements that align with our own human experience but are we as humans just
stuck with a particular kind of internal experience the growth of technology in a particular
sensors and measuring devices has certainly expanded the range of inputs that can be delivered to our
brains and the growth of our collective knowledge about the world has expanded our ways of representing
and thinking about things right now those are basically our only ways of modifying our detailed
internal experience but what if we were to connect directly and internally into our brains
presumably at least at first we need the kind the need the kind of neural user interface to
be familiar and we be forced into for example concentrating everything into a single thread
of experience but what if we allowed multi-way experience well of course our brains already
made up of billions of neurons that each do that each do things but it seems to be a core
feature of human experience that we concentrate those things to give us a single thread of experience
and that seems to be to be an essential feature of being an observer like us
that kind of concentration also happens in a flock of birds or an ant colony or a human society
in all of these cases each individual organism does their thing but somehow collective decisions
get made with many different detailed situations getting equivalents together to leave only the
final decision so that means that from the outside the system behaves as we would expect
of an observer like us internally that kind of observer behavior is happening above the
experience of each single individual but still at the level of the hive mind its behavior typical
and of an observer like us that's not to say though that we can readily imagine what it's like
to be a system like this or even to be one of its parts and the effort to explore the berber theory
an important direction is to try to imagine ourselves having a different kind of experience
than we do and from within that experience try to see what kinds of laws we would attribute say
to the physical universe in the early 20th century particularly in the context of relativity and
quantum mechanics it became clear that being more realistic about the observer was crucial in moving
forward in science things like computational irreducibility and even more so our physics
project take that another step one used to imagine that science should be somehow be fundamentally
objective and independent of all aspects of the observer but what's become clear is that it's not
and that the nature of us as observers is actually crucial in determining what science we experience
but the crucial point is that there are often powerful conclusions that can be drawn
even without knowing all the details of an observer and that's a central reason for
building a general observer theory in effect to give an objective way of formally and robustly
characterizing what one might consider to be the subjective elements of science
all right and that's what i wrote in my essay so if people have questions or comments i'd be happy
to try to take those lots of things
from david what are the computational rules of observation how do you get from bits of space
to bits of meaning well
the the question is what's sort of underneath the physical universe
how do we and how does that relate to formal systems and places where we can discuss questions
like meaning and the whole point of what we've done with the idea of the rulliad is that it is a
formal structure that is both beneath physical space and beneath the abstract systems we can
construct i mean this is a complicated question and it sort of relates to uh questions like why
does physical space exist why does the universe exist and i think my answer to that which i'm
very surprised is possible to give is the rule the rulliad inevitably exists once you have a
definition of terms it is inevitable that the rulliad exists and has the structure it has
just like we can define you know one plus ones and pluses and we can conclude that one plus one
equals two just as a necessary feature of the definition of ones and pluses and things so similarly
the rulliad necessarily has the structure it has now the question of why the rulliad is actualized
as something where it's the universe where we can pick things up and do things to them and so on
the thing to realize is that in a sense the surprise is that we exist that the rulliad
necessarily exists the fact that there is an entity like us that has an inner experience of
some aspects of the rulliad that's not so obvious and although we can argue that that well so that
that's a thing that you sort of have to scientifically derive that that there can be entities like us
and many copies of entities like us and we can build this whole thing with many minds that
think they're all doing the same kinds of things that's something that as a matter of kind of science
you can say why is it like that but the fact that there is something rather than nothing
is inevitable because it is a purely formal thing but our our experience of that thing is it's it's
still as perfectly real to us as anything else because we are as abstract as we as it is it's
not like we're saying there's there's us that form abstract thoughts and then there's a a thing out
there that is hard physical reality the hard physical reality is made of the same abstract
stuff as those thoughts that we're internally generating so that's a that's a an approach to
a pretty difficult philosophical issue but that's a little bit of an attempt at that
Kenneth says are you saying there are no discrete objects everything is connected there's just
sort of oneness of quantum fields in some sense yes the Ruliad is this single object
that connects everything that that is and when we parse it we absolutely parse it as separate
different things we say there's this electron here and there's another electron there but in the end
those electrons are made of the same atoms of existence and there are there's this sort of
elaborate set of connections between those atoms of existence defined by the processes of computation
that build up the Ruliad denial asks who observes the observer well that's some as I was saying
there are a bunch of different sort of definitions of observers and how observers work and so on
that do require an observer observing the observer and I suppose that the experience we have
we have an inner experience each one of us has an inner experience but we observe other people
who we assume have the same kinds of inner experiences so that's a case of sort of observing
the observer and I think this very fact that we assume that different people have similar kinds
of internal experiences is kind of the thing that closes the loop of sort of this question
about who observes who observes the observer so to speak it's a it's a very intrinsic assumption
that we have might not be true but it's an intrinsic assumption that we have that I think
for us sort of closes that loop
Chumblesworth asks does computational boundedness lead to unpredictability thanks to chaos theory
well that's complicated so I mean the idea of chaos theory is that a small change
in the initial conditions for a system will eventually expand to be a large change of behavior
so the the case where let's say you have an array of cells discrete cells and you just flip
one bit you change one of those initial cells what will often happen is that the the the
evolutions the results that you get from evolving with one one flip of that bit you compare that
with the evolution you get from the other flip of that bit and they'll get progressively more
and more different so for example the the kind of the change associated with flipping that bit
might initially be just localized to that bit then it will expand to be three bits five bits
etc it will expand out to more and more bits that's kind of the essence of this chaos theory idea
is that you can't know what's going to happen unless you know every precise detail of the
initial conditions unless you know every bit in the initial condition because flipping any one bit
will eventually affect all the other bits now it's a bit confusing in the way chaos theory is
often really talked about because it originated beginning of the 20th century and was kind of
really emphasized in in the 1970s and so on the 19 beginning of the 1980s in the idea that
if you have real numbers if you have decimal numbers 1.758264 etc etc etc then
this same phenomenon that I mentioned changing one bit can have an effect on the answer that also
happens if you change a bit far far down in the number so you know the coefficient of of 10 to
the minus 100 or something in the number the hundredth bit in the number a hundredth digit in
the number change that eventually the effect of that will get amplified up to have an effect on
the whole behavior of the system it's actually exactly the same phenomenon as one's talking about
but sort of changing the this facial spread of some effect it's the same phenomenon it looks
confusingly different in the mathematics because of things to do with the way that people think
about real numbers and so on it's sort of a pre computational way of thinking about things
a thing where you're thinking about kind of just math just happens rather than there have to be rules
by which you derive every successive step in the math that you're generating so the
question about the relationship between sort of the spreading of information that is the
that is the relevant as opposed to rather confusing aspect of chaos theory how does that
relate to computational boundedness and unpredictability yes there is I think a relation
in the sense that if you have if you are well let's see there's a relation but it's not the
whole story the relation is if you are sort of a bounded computational entity sensitive to only
a particular part of what's happening in the world then yes insofar as effects can spread from
outside that region to inside that region that will be a reason why you can't predict what's
going to happen but the more important effect I think most of the time is that even within that
region there are processes going on that you can't readily predict there are irreducible processes
going on even within that region that you can't readily predict even independent of the rate at
which things are flowing in from the out from outside that region it's kind of like the following
thing if you imagine a bunch of molecules and they're they're doing their thing in some particular
system there's a certain rate at which the effect of essentially heat sort of random
motion of molecules knocking those molecules from the outside knocking around those molecules
that the extent to which that happens that's kind of the flow of outside stuff into your system
versus kind of what's happening intrinsic to the system now for example in quantum computing
that the big issue is can you prevent that sort of heat from the outside in messing with the
qubits that you're so carefully setting up and looking at so that's a case where sort of computational
irreducibility within the system you try very hard to isolate the system and not have effects
flow in from the outside but yes computational boundedness and and the comparative infinity of
the world is a form that that will lead to certain kinds of unpredictability as the effect of sort
of the outside of the world gets into what's happening on the inside but I think that's a
tends to be a much slower effect than the internal effect of kind of the the sort of
computational processes within the system itself not things that you hadn't considered to be part
of the system and and obviously one one thing one might think of is come on come on isolate the
system come on close it up and and that's a lot of what one tries to do when one has sort of
stable qubits in quantum computing and things like this
Prab asks can we confidently say where we are in the Ruliad well a challenging thing is to
coordinateize the Ruliad I mean like like where are we in space you know I was just you know where
are we it's like we say well we're here on the earth and we can set up coordinate systems and we
longitude on the earth okay where's the earth well it's going around the sun we can set up a
coordinate system for the solar system that's anchored at the center of mass of the solar system
or at the center of the sun and we can say this is where we are relative to the center of the sun
and so on okay where are we in the galaxy well there is a somewhat more elaborate galactic
coordinate system that's been made up as a matter of convention that allows us to say where we are
in the galaxy where are we in the universe it's a pretty arbitrary thing to set up that coordinate
system and describe where we are I mean we could say we're part of this supercluster that we've
named this particular thing but you know that coordinate system is a very arbitrary thing to
put down now it's an interesting question how do we coordinateize branches space how do we
coordinateize the Ruliad do we have a way of naming the coordinate positions in the Ruliad
we do not not yet I mean they're just like we don't have a way of of of absolutely naming
where the earth is or our galaxy is in the universe now you can say we're here and we can say
how far away is this thing so for example I did this study of generative AI looking at kind of
different sort of concepts that can be generated like I was looking at you know cat island the
concepts that are in in meaning space and the latent space of the generative AI that are near
the concept of a cat or the concept of a dog and there's a huge volume of inter concept space
analogous to interstellar space between the things we have defined as human concepts and we can ask
questions like if you go from cats to dogs that defines a vector a direction the cat to dog direction
you can keep going in that direction you can see what you got find out there but co-ordinatizing
something like the Ruliad is complicated and we certainly don't know how to do it I mean if we say
you know let's put down where certain minds are in the Ruliad we've got different different people
let's say who exist as different minds which are effectively like points in the Ruliad interesting
question how are we co-ordinateized in Rulial space you know in a sense minds that are more aligned
are going to be closer in Rulial space but what's the direction you know if we go from from you know
Jim to Jane and we keep going do we get to Bob after a while in Rulial space we don't know any
of that we don't know how to think about yet these kinds of of co-ordinateizations we don't know
if we look at we have certain ways of of embedding for example words in in meaning spaces and so on
and we can ask you know if you start from the word rhinoceros and you go to to antelope and you
keep going what what what do you get to the space is not flat enough that that's a terribly meaningful
question but that's the type of thing that one would do if one was sort of co-ordinateizing
something like the Ruliad Dr. Evil asks is the multi-way graph method
based on Everettian quantum mechanics so this kind of many worlds quantum mechanics idea
is somewhat but not terribly related I think it's always difficult you know I spend a bunch of effort
kind of doing history of science trying to understand kind of how different ideas are fitted together
I have not worked on questions about the ideas of quantum mechanics and how they're fitted together
I have worked on the case of the second door of thermodynamics which turns out to be a very
complicated 200-year story about how different ideas were fitted together and how different
confusions occurred and how people assume different things and so on but so I don't know
this as well as I as I might like to but I think one of the big differences is that this notion of
us being extended observers in Braunschild space is very different in traditional many
worlds quantum mechanics it's like there's a single thread of existence that we exist on but
if we are if we're looking at this whole Braunschild space of all these different ends of different
sort of paths of history laid out in the space the the idea in our models is that we are extended
objects in Braunschild space just like we're extended objects in physical space I think that's
rather different I think also that the idea that happens in multi-way graphs in general
that you can have mergers of paths as well as branching of paths is another different thing I
think that may have been something that was in ever its original work but didn't survive in
interpretations of that work so that's my that's my rough impression I think that the like many of
the things from mathematical physics my guess is that there and I think people have already done this
that there are sort of results and mathematical results and things from from many words quantum
mechanics that can be imported into thinking about our physics project and given the sort of
understanding from our physics project you can then export that to some of these other areas
but I don't know in detail what's been done there Erin says um
this might be related to a different thing these stereo vision formulas to capture imagery and map
the shapes I think that's not related to this this live stream um let's see moon asks are you
kind of defining the axioms of einstein's observer in special relativity okay that's an interesting
point you know einstein made a set of essentially logical assumptions in his 1905 paper on special
relativity you know there's nothing that goes faster than light different observers in different
reference frames uh sort of perceive the same physics and so on I am I think it's very likely
that it's possible to derive our results about our physics project and our models of the of
reality on the basis of a similar kind of philosophical axiomatic structure the difference
is only this einstein was able to go from that set of kind of axiomatic assumptions very easily to
a mathematical framework that allowed him to derive things quite quite precisely for us that
framework is considerably more complicated I mean the the just the structure of these kinds of
computational things is much less we didn't luck out it's not a simple math so to speak as it was
for einstein just simple formulas and things what we're dealing with is something that is to us
much more difficult to deal with there's a there's a whole chunk of computational
irreducibility there which is an issue that einstein didn't happen to have I mean as a matter
of fact there's a piece of history 1905 einstein wrote three spectacular papers one of which was
about special relativity they were all papers that in a sense were sort of here's a logical way of
thinking about the world here's its consequences and it connects to math in the three years before
1905 einstein had written I think three papers about a different subject to subject that I've
been very interested in which is the derivation of the second law of thermodynamics the derivation
of the law of entropy increase einstein thought he had proved that law he was wrong he had a similar
kind of logical structure of let's put down these axioms about heat engines and things like this
and from them prove the second law of thermodynamics they were all they were all misses it didn't work
but then he turned the same kinds of thinking to special relativity to the to the idea of
photons to how brown in motion works and bingo on all of them it worked perfectly so and in fact
so it's a case where in a sense the thing that einstein didn't succeed on with that type of
thinking was exactly the thing that now I think we finally a hundred years later 120 years later
been able to be successful with and but it requires this kind of raft of other of other
ideas about computational irreducibility computation in general principle of computational
equivalence a lot of other kinds of things to to actually technically get to that point and actually
you know I guess old albert was was a was a smart cookie and in fact 1916 the year after he
invented general relativity the theory of of spacetime the gravity and so on he wrote some
letter to somebody in which he said in the end it will turn out that spacetime is discrete the
spacetime that he assumed was this continuous sort of calculus accessible spacetime in the end
spacetime he said will turn out to be discrete but we do not yet have the methods necessary
to analyze how that will work which he was completely correct about those methods required
this whole seemed to have required this kind of whole tower of ideas about computation and so on
and it took a hundred years for us to have those methods but now we do and now we're in a position
to actually talk about these things in a in a meaningful way but so it would be very nice to
be able to formulate the things I'm talking about in terms of in a sense like you can make this logical
point make that logical point then make this conclusion it won't probably work quite as
nice as it did for Einstein because because of the fact that he happened to have sort of low
hanging mathematical fruit to pick to to describe the world given those those axiomatic assumptions
we don't for us it's more complicated it's things like saying the observer is computationally bounded
the universe is computationally irreducible so certain things follow from that and yes we can
absolutely say that but to say and the answer is one over square root of one minus v squared over c
squared we won't get quite as nice and simple a formula we won't get to get to the point where
we have formulas we have to do a lot more work and and it's a different different kind of thing
uh jh says Lenny Susskind has described an observation as an entanglement
um gosh you know it's always very bad you you you know the only real way and this is kind of a
rural space comment the only real way that to untangle whether what person a says what person
b says how they're related is at best to watch the interactive communication between person a and
person b i i don't i mean yes gosh i mean quantum measurements are related to entanglements and
there's a whole formalism for that um i don't i don't know exactly what this what this particular
idea is um let's see the uh uh a couple more things and then i have to go back to my day job here um
herb asks is analysis our best bet to transfer an observation between two observers in a lossless
fashion i think our best bet is probably computational language or mathematical language
it's a formal description that sort of both is an interesting question i mean that both observers
can be kind of educated to think of in the same way i mean human language is partly of that kind
but there's a lot less kind of you know although it creates all kinds of social issues but there's
a lot less kind of certainty about you say this word and i say this word do we mean the same thing
by that word that's something where there is less you know that becomes a social question of whether
we mean the same thing by those words and i would say that in in mathematics or in computational
language the particularly in computational language do you mean the same thing by those words
there is a hard definition of meaning because in the end the computational language is executed
and it does the computer does a definite thing and so that's a that's a place in which you can
you can kind of nail down that really means the same thing so i would say that actually
probably it's a good point i mean that computational language and our whole war from
language stack that i just spent the last 40 years building um that that really is the best
example of a lossless way of communicating ideas from one observer to another because it is something
where there is a a definition and you know there is a a clear meaning to it because it's how it
executes and and yet as humans we can start trying to two different humans can try to sort of
separately understand what that kind of uh it can can sort of separately understand those things
and they can both be attached to the same meaning let's see uh
memes is asking how should observers like us consider scientific measurements
i think the point about measurements is that we are trying to take certain things into our
internal experience and what there are different kinds of things we can measure if we don't have
an electronic amplifier we can't measure small small effects that are electrically represented
if we don't have a microscope we can't see very small things um that's uh those are the
you know in a sense the that scientific measurements provide and the and the sensors
and measuring devices we have provide a way of extending our own built-in biological sensors
to have a broader domain of of of access to the world and i think the same is true with kind of
methods of analysis paradigms and so on there are things where we just sort of say oh that's just
random stuff out there and then we have some paradigm for thinking about and we say no no no
that's really a blah blah blah we have a name for it and so on kind of thing and i think that's um uh
that's kind of and and what we're doing as we come up with different measuring devices
as we come up with different methods of analysis different paradigms we're gradually expanding
the domain ultimately in rural space that we have access to as observers and we're gradually
expanding the domain where we can pull in kind of things happening out there in the world into
our internal experience and i think that that it is interesting that i mean i don't really understand
it's something one one should study kind of this this funnel of of just how far are we getting in
rural space how far are we getting you know all these measuring devices there are 10 000 different
kinds of units that we measure we inventoried all of them for for now for for example um and you
know what how far do we get with this you know if we go another if we look at you an interesting
question it's very simple historical question is how have the number of such units increased over
time the specifics of units have probably changed because they've become more standardized and it's
not like every city-state has its own weights and measures type thing um but if we look at the the
kinds of things you know length time to the minus three you know mass to the minus two or
something what what what forms of thing have we tried to measure i'm sure there's a growth of that
over time it'd be interesting to see what that is and that's kind of the in a sense that's the sort
of that's the progression of our ability to observe things in in the world it'd be an interesting
thing to look at all right well thanks very much for joining me and you can read the the main
essay that i was going through here um at writings.stevenwolfman.com and you can ask more questions
and have more discussion at our at my sort of regularly scheduled live streams that come up
twice a week Wednesdays and Fridays normally so anyway thanks for joining me and until another time
bye for now.
you
